not for large houses with more than one electrical circuits i bought a set of four westinghouse intercoms usually people buy intercoms because they have a large house and don t want to have to trapes all over it to communicate with other people these westinghouse intercoms and i believe the same goes for the novi intercoms require that all itercoms be on the same electrical circuit that is controlled by the same electrical breaker so if your kitchen family room master bedroom and garage outlets are on different breakers in your main electrical control panel and you want to set up an intercom system the westinghouse system will not work for you intercoms are usually for large houses large houses usually have more than one electrical circuit for outlets hence this product likely will not work for most people i replaced the westinghouse intercom system with one by another manufacturer called the wirefree intercom reporter this is a four channel system and it works great works either with batteries or transformer it is independent of the electrical circuits

too good to be true i purchased this item to record lps into my computer thru the input on this device it sounded worse than recording through the mono microphone input that was built into my laptop had same experience with loud right out of the box too startled me out of my skin ! mine didn t come with any disk although the box mentions software then again i bought this from an amazon partner from amazon spend your money wisely and get an imic i m going to 
told by company that it would take up to four weeks i am the type of person that always buys the extra warranty on whatever i purchase however i started reading the reviews on this company and many people reported that it was four weeks and counting and they still hadn t received their refund check i was astonished i contacted n ew myself and asked them about this with no shame or embarrassment on the part of the customer service reps i was informed that if i did everything by email it would take at least business days thats three weeks to receive my refund check after i sent them the warrantied item if i had them send me a pre paid label for the defective item instead of using my own printer it would take a week for me to receive and at least a week for them to receive the covered item in other words it would take no less than four weeks to receive the replacement check and possibly up to eight weeks ! i cancelled the contract immediately it is just not worth it when you really do the math to purchase this contract i would recommend buying a product from a company that first makes a quality product and then back it up with a good warranty and gives good customer service such as grado sennheiser or koss but stay away from these people that s my feeling and my advice 
broke within the first month i decided on this item because i liked the idea of putting it in my cup holder and not having to worry about where to place my sansa e the mp player will sit nicely in the holder if you don t have a case on it but i purchased the speck toughskin which makes the player thicker luckily you can pull off a cheap plastic template piece and still use it with a case but it won t hold it very securely and it would pop off once in a while when i hit a big bump this thing worked great for a few weeks great sound then one day i tried to turn it on and it wouldn t power on i checked all the plugs but it still wouldn t work i sent it back and am going to try the fm transmitter from maximo i probably just got a dud but they lost my trust 
do no buy this item i was trying to duplicate hi tapes and the ads tech video express usbav ef is not a viable solution it drops frames and there are nothing that can be done to improve its recording the installation is buggy i ended up buying a sony vrd mc and am extremely happy with it 
rip off doesn t advertise that you need an ac adaptor i would like to believe that this hub works well but i wouldn t know i bought it to reduce clutter on my desk from all my devices hooking into my powermac i hooked up my printer ipod and digital camera and nothing happened i called targus and they said i needed an a c adaptor it doesn t come with one and doesn t say anything about one in the manual or instructions or their website they said i could get it at radio shack and gave me the info volt amp center positive i ve been to two radio shacks and online they don t carry it i m upset any advice 
poor quality poor service i bought a sharp lcd tv from j r in new york last jan after a year and half when powering on the tv sometimes works sometimes not after unplug in wait for a while and plug back worked for a couple months send it to service center to checkup was told that the lcd control board needs to be replaced when request to get back the replaced lcd control board was told that sharp does not give back the replaced board it has to be shipped back otherwise you have to pay additional fee to get back the replaced board it s rather strange to hear such a lousy policy from any vendor but if you do want to get a sharp better get a long long warranty 
junk i purchased this cd player as a gift for someone and the cd player didn t work either ! very disappointing do not purchase this product

white dust we thought it was great until we started noticing white dust on everything we changed the filter but that didn t help and we ve been using soft distilled water we ve got to get a different one ! i don t recommend this humidifier unless you want to dust off white dust off everything everyday no fun 
very slow my best usb drive is the lexar media jde jumpdrive elite usb mb drive which i had for about a year and a half but i needed more space so i thought i would buy this as the upgrade since it s made by the same company and has the same brand name and they don t make the other model in g anymore this drive is very slow i timed the same backup procedure on both drives and my older mb was at least twice as fast 
read the terms and condition pdf i bought this thinking failures due to normal wear and tear which is checked on the checklist of items covered on the overview page would include accidental damage such as dropping however the pdf indicates that damage from accident abuse misuse introduction of foreign objects into the product is not covered this is just an extended manufacturer s warranty a call to customer service confirms this damage due to accidents are not covered save your money 
n ew sucks big time okay this is not a review of the product itself but i stronglyencourage you to consider not getting an n ew warranty they arereally not in the business to fix things but to make money not fixing things if you had anything to do with the device not working eg you dropped it forget about it they aint gonna fix replace it whatever they have a very sparce network of repair companies so if there is no one who can fix it in your area you have to ship it to them in virginia of course you have to pay for the shipping ! lastly they tend to screw over their repair companies so in some cases they will refuse to repair items covered under an n ew warranty or they will take forever to repair it since they know n ew will take months to pay them for the work they did if you want a nightmare for a warranty then by all means go for it 
very unsatisfactory i m returning loud hiss all the time the sound comes and goes all the time works mins then stops have to turn volume up loud to get it back when working sounds ok but will not continue working i have a pretty new sony tv and am only feet away but the unit just does not work shame i liked it when it worked

high hopes poor product with very limited device support little or no customer support and a premium price tom tom blew an opportunity to change how consumers view hybrid gps units perhaps the competition will learn from this and provide the tool we are all looking for 
quite possibly the worst mouse in the history of all mice do not buy this mouse this mouse has given me nothing but frustration the front of the mouse where the buttons are located is extremely low causing a muscle strain in your hand if you use it for long periods of time battery life is horrible like weeks when your mouse is idle for minutes it goes into an automatic sleep mode the manual says to touch the metal lines on the side to revive it but when i do it simply freeze the cursor on the screen so i have to reboot my computer absolutely the worst ! 
installation nightmare i haven t listened to these yet and i m sure the sound quality is great however trying to get the grilles to fit on the speakers after installing them in the ceiling has just been the most frustrating job of my entire kitchen rehab 
freezes and tech help not good i purchased dvd express and it never worked i spent endless time with tech support the old story about it must be your computer did not fly either my machine is a media type and it far exceeds the system requirements advertised by ads i exchanged the item and it was supposedly checked out before i got it same problems tech support told me i was the only person having trouble with this product they need to check out a few websites that review products there are hundreds of bad reviews very few good ones my only mistake was not reading them before i wasted my time and money ads also told me it would not work with ulead s movie factory some of the software it came bundled with but that was uleads problem i should use cap wiz their program duh guess what it did not work with their program either ulead said they had several complaints with ads s product their final solution hold on to the product and maybe they will have a new version of cap wiz and that might work save yourself time money and aggravation buy another product ! p s since ads doesn t consider the product defective they will not refund your money or allow you trade it in for an upgrade i don t think they want a product like that either the only reason i gave one star is it was packed well ju 
wrong product amazon shipped the wrong size notebook no problem returned the product amazon is a great merchant will buy from them again 
horrbile quality this cheap piece of plastic broke within months of me owning it buyer beware ! 
sounds worse than the laptop speakers the builtin speakers in my laptop sounded better and louder than these speakers the sony s highs are muddy and the volume does not go very loud yes my laptop volume was all the way up if you want extra laptop speakers for your presentations with clients look elsewhere all we wanted was a decent quality sound that was a little louder than our laptop speakers and these speakers definitely did not deliver and will be returned if you need ultra portable sound and your laptop speakers are broken or sound much worse than average laptops we have nothing special then maybe this would work for you 
very flaky with bluetooth after few days very flaky with bluetooth after few days no support phone don t waste your 
didn t seem to last all that long brought two packs of these on vacation had them run out on me faster than it seemed they should do not seem better than energizer nor duracell i bought some lithium energizers to use for my next trip i was using them in a canon digital camera which works with normal alk batteries bought these as a get to fill in purchase at amazon 
agree with j stern not a very good copy i made two data dvds and used the hp lightscribe discs i wasn t very pleased with the outcome either the pictures were dull and not very clear to the person who gave it stars don t think i don t know what i was doing i checked all the color contrast from best to normal picked what i wanted and the print still came out bad i will be trying something else because the hp dvds aren t worth the money 
good light short life this is a very well designed light and works very well you have better control of the light vs snake neck light types the quailty of light put out is good and is not so bright as to create glare there is one major flaw in this light it has a very short life span it died after only two months 
defective product apart from the money part imagine the dis appointment happening to the kids if the product doesn t work at the first sight ok moreover when tried to return it there is no acknowledgement nor any response back regarding the refund why is it being sold again if the product is defective please stop selling the product and take a closer look at the product review before selling it again it is really annoying when things like this happens please rectify it is also disapointing when we cannot talk to a customer service personnel over the phone 
good piano but the stool breaks easily i bought this last christmas for my three year old and five year old thesound of the piano is a little off but all in all the piano is nice for the price the leg of the stool breaks very easily don t buy unless you can fix 
total piece of junk don t be deceived by the sleek modern looks and digital tuning of this radio although the am fm portion worked fine and dandy it was the noaa weather radio band that i was truly interested in who buys a radio at this price just for am fm to no avail could i catch any reception pure static with the noaa radio station even though i live less than miles from their watt transmitter ! at first i thought the noaa station was down but a friend came over with a cheap analog tuner and caught the station very clear due to our high reception area therefore this unit is absolutely useless to me it s a good thing i bought and tested the unit before extreme weather hit me or else i could be dead today ! so not only is it a rip off piece of garbage but it s a public safety hazard if you value your life don t buy this 
does not live up to its promise i had high hopes for this but three major flaws contributed to it being returned the display is extremely bright i ended up covering it with a t shirt just to be able to get to sleep even though bright the display cannot be read unless you are close and at the correct angle the sounds quality was surprisingly bad i knew this wasn t a fancy expensive model but the sound was unbearably distorted especially at lower volumes eg you want your ipod music on in the background i though my ipod battery was dead at first but apparently the speakers on this unit are just that bad so it fails as a clock and as an ipod player i never tried the radio function but even if that was excellent it would not have saved the product from being returned 
major problems with trying to watch any type of movie video viewing the internet this monitor was great when i tried to play a movie dvd disc mpeg avi anything the picture was terrible very bad pixilation i was told it might be the video card i bought a new card xfx geforce gs for another same quality on films i tried latest driver from xfx from nvidia etc changed screen resolutions everything you could think of i tried the picture for viewing movies was terrible i hooked my old inch monitor back up the picture quality for movies is great i have returned this monitor now i have to wait for a refund before i will try a different monitor the black light bleed is very bad if you watch films on your monitor you can t help but notice it ps amazon was great about refunding shipping amazon is the best online store there is 
what the description here does not tell you this adapter is not for use with a radio ! i live in a fairly strong signal area and the noise from this adapter totally wipes out am a kw station ! which is what i listen to most often ! 
great product design layout horrible functionality as mentioned the layout of the keyboard is great it s comfortable has most the shortcut s i d want however it s designed for media center and media center only no ie internet shortcuts are present which in my opinion is a bad design everyone that has a media center pc also has windows xp professional which could use those short cutsmy largest gripe about this product is the mouse why microsoft makes you press downward in addition to the direction of the mouse is beyond me we ve had it about a month now and despite other users saying it gets better with time ours has not i was expecting a laptop like fingermouse and that s not what this keyboard has 
deceptive marketing at its finest the one and only reason i purchased this label printer was for the highly touted dymo stamps feature supposedly giving you the ability to print your own postage stamps onto thermal postage labels for no monthly fee only the cost of the printer and the thermal label refills according to the dymo stamps website dymo stamps gives you the ability to print exactly the amount of postage you need and eliminate the need for costly postal meters what the consumer is not told upfront is that these precise amounts of postage can only be in denominations of the dymo stamps software s choosing not any amount you want in fact the only postage denominations that can be printed are those already available in stamp form at the post office basically just your run ofthemill stamps priority mail stamps and postcard stamps this software also does not give you the capability to print postage for parcel post media mail or express mail and doesn t allow you to add additional postage for services like insurance or certified mail at all how this saves you any trouble over buying stamps from the post office is beyond me conveniently you can only overcome all of these limitations by subscribing to endicia dymo stamps backbone provider for a monthly fee heck you can t even go to an office supply store to buy the thermal postage label refills that you need to print postage on they can only be ordered online through a link in the dymo stamps software especially given the fact that even the least expensive dymo stamps capable labelwriter model is over this will not save you any money in postage will not save you any time and ordering stamps online from usps or getting them from the local post office is just as convenient if not more convenient than ordering the stupid thermal refills online from dymo and waiting for them to arrive thankfully amazon is great at accepting returns 
cd player does not work i have exchanged this karaoke machine twice already but the cd player does not work i can t believe that toys r us would have this toy on their shelves it is really annoying i plan to return it and buy another karaoke machine 
big disappoinment man were we diappointed with this ge phone ! we did everything right trained the battery in the beginning made sure we routinely charged it never dropped or abused this phone and then one day it started not holding a charge we couldn t figure it out it worked fine for about a year and then completely crapped out just like the other reviewers have said we had a year old toshiba that was so fabulous and reliable up to it s unfortunate demise which is when we acquired this loser are there any good phones out there somewhere 
total junk after about months of using these cables they are starting to flake out my screen will start flashing and one of the colors will go completely out have tried hooking it up to different inputs on t v and used different sources with same symptoms if you dont mind jiggling the cable every other day then these may be for you 
lots of problems with this player my cyberhome portable dvd player worked for all of day it is unable to play dvds or cds of any type also if you charge the battery according to manufacturer specs it will completely drain out within hours i attempted to get service from cyberhome to no avail even though product is still under warranty their support number is unreachable as is their support email address attempts to locate the company via the web were unsuccessful this would have been a great product at a great price if only it had worked purchase at you own risk check out the manufacturer web site you have been warned 
a portable device ideal for non portable computers looks sleek runs fast on my dual opteron with suse reformatted to ext very well unfortunately it will not work on my dell precision m not enough power on the usb port i guess i wish it had an optional connector for a power supply now i will have to hack the cable waste of time 
never worked it gave me format errors out of the box i returned it to tiger direct for an exchange and got a refund instead not to happy about paying all the shipping costs for nothing 
needs two usb slots i bought this to replace an gb portable firewire drive wanted more capacity and the same convenient portability there s nothing convenient about its need for usb slots and the data moves slower than the firewire drive it is replacing nice little glitch on the small type of the packaging if you re reading the requirements for mac os x you miss the bullet point in the win xp section calling out the need for free ports amazon s description of the product is similarily misleading as completely negelcts the mention of needing two usb ports boooo seagate i m offended that you re offering such clumsy connectivity 
lots of issues this item has a lot of flaws the only reason i got it was the price was quite less and it was a nice techy stocking stuffer of sorts i have listed some of the issues i have seen with this product here battery case this is a flimsy piece of plastic and the finger that enables the cover to click shut will break with the slightest pressue i totally agree with the other people who commented on this issue yes you can prevent it from breaking if you are willing to spend minutes to slowly change the batteries but once you tend to hurry up with this process the end is inevitable power off the power off si the same as play or power on if you want to power it off you got to press until you see the unit display switch off else it will stay powered on and playing and drain the battery or probably if in recording more might use up your entire storage space chord comes with chord to hang the unit around the neck while listening to stuff but unfortunately just like the battery case the groove on the unit into which you are supposed to slip the chord and fasten it is flimsy as well it might break off if you have it caught somewhere and try to pull it free instead of patiently working it ui is bad the ipod click wheel is very simple and so is the zune ui this one is simple cos there is just one way to use it but its not easy to use go for a ipod nano if you will this one is not worth the investment 
bads don t make a good the specs look great and the features it has work great sound quality is amazing but many parts of the device are cheaply made such as the main navigaion controll device and the headphone jack both things needed for operation of the player also if you re buying this for ogg or flac playback be warned it doesn t play many of these properly within two weeks the screen broke i tried to get it repaired with cowon but they where of no help so i returned it to amazon 
worst mouse ever i just bought my first imac i love the computer but hate the mouse it came with it it is always jumping all over the screen it is hard for me to control it the scroll function works okay and the design is nice and sleek i am definitely going to get another mouse before it drives me nuts 
poor quality control even worse sharp customer service i ordered this television with high hopes knowing that despite reports of firmware problems and other defects that i would luck out and save a bundle but you get what you pay for every sharp aquos lcd tv manufactured before april shipped with bad firmware what does this mean to you for me it meant that minutes after unpacking the tv and turning it on it turned itself off and never turned back on again resets system resets power cycling unplugging components didn t help my tv was completely bricked a search turned up threads on websites like avs forum with other owners of sharp tvs in the du and du series all reporting similar power management problems almost immediately after purchase for them the fix was a visit to a sharp authorized service center to either have the firmware replaced or a physical replacement of boards inside the tv i say a visit because sharp does not cover in house technician visits for tvs under a fact they could have informed me of before letting me wait week for a tech visit that would ultimately be canceled so here i am days later and hundreds of dollars poorer with no tv to show for it instead it sits at the authorized service center because sharp obviously does not vet its service centers to make sure you get good service from them either im willing to bet all of the inventory of dus that tigerdirect is selling at fire sale prices were produced before check the serial number on your tv if you do order one if it begins with a or immediately demand a firmware upgrade from sharp besharp regardless of whether or not you re experiencing these issues you will eventually and hopefully while sharp s warranty is still in effect for you 
was great but unreliable i bought this shredder a year ago from target and at first was very very happy with it it s powerful shreds great has a window to see the basket and is very convenient but my euphoria did not last long after a month the sensor died so that when i put it in auto on mode it always ran instead of sensing when i was putting something into it then tonight after a year and very light use overall the shredder seized up as i put unfolded sheets of paper into it so now i m in the market for a new one had it been reliable it would have been a great shredder but this one absolutely is not 
short bulb life rated as hour bulb life when purchased today they claim hours bulb lasted only hours service at unfocused does not care about creating a satisfied customer base would not replace bulb even on a prorated basis 
awful do not buy this may be the worst product i ve ever bought it has never worked properly i ve kept fresh batteries in it but it s still no good within feet of the laptop i ll click three or four times and nothing happens then i ll click and the slides go in fast forward until the end it s quite embarrassing to be giving a professional presentation and have this happen awful product believe the bad reviews it s worse than they describe the only positive thing i can say about the product is that it doubles nicely as a cat toy my cat loves the laser pointer 
great tv while it lasted beautiful tv for days samsung sets new standards for lousy customer service initially they told me days before someone would call to make an appointment to look at it it has been days and the phone hasn t rung i live in a major metro area dell apple and others set high standards and expectations for customer care stay away from samsung 
severely outdated this card was very good about years ago if you don t know much about computers and you re looking to get a friend a gift or trying to buy a cheap video card listen to this there is no such thing as a good cheap video card the hardware demands for modern games are so high they require constant upgrading of hardware so if you re looking to keep up with pc games you re waisting your money unless you invest in the best video card you can can get pricey though it is well worth the investment don t let this card fool you sure it has mb memory but that s just bait this card is slower than my old ati all inwonder which only has mb of memory 
nice while it lasted i bought this mouse a couple months ago to use with my macbook pro i loved it until a couple days ago when it decided to stop working it s not connecting to the usb adapter any more i changed the battery and tried the connect button and nothing sad isn t it 
what s the point of sleeves i can t close the case i got in on this deal for a great price but when i put cd s in i couldn t even come close to closing the case now i have to transfer them all back to the other case 
has to be one of the worst products on the market this router has to be one of the worst made products on the market and has the poor customer service this router was defective out of the box took weeks of communication with linksys s customer service before i finally just returned it and build my own router with the same functions 
nah you can get a pack of emerging power mah batteries for on this very site i did they work great why would anyone pay almost bucks just for the batteries ridiculous 
dual tuner problematic two problems have surfaced using the tivo unit the first is the lack of a pin serial port for connection of the tuning cable which causes the use of the funky light attachment at the front of the unit when hooked to a direct tv box sometmes the tuning is inaccurate causing misfires when programs are recorded the other problem is that internally the tivo unit looks for a basic cable signal erratically for the second tuner i have replaced all of the cables with new shielded cables so i know that is not the problem i am replacing it with a direct tv dvr when the tivo works it is great but it is not reliable enough for me 
not for the non techie type i finally got my uno to work with my yamaha keyboard yes that s right i have a yamaha keyboard ypt here s how i did it i installed the drivers before i plugged in the usb device strangely the uno was not using m audio drivers even though the hardware wizard looked like it figured everything out correctly i checked device manager to see if the drivers were installed correctly they were not to get into device manager i right clicked on my computer then clicked on properties clicked on the hardware tab clicked on the device manager button clicked on the plus sign next to sound video and game controllers double clicked on usb audio device if you have m audio usb uno driver in the list don t go any further your drivers are fine though you may want to update them as of it is version clicked on the driver tab then clicked on the update driver button clicked on the install from a list or specific location advanced radio button then clicked next clicked on dont search i will choose the driver to install radio button then next the m audio usb uno midi driver should be in the compatible hardware list you will have to select it otherwise it will use microsoft s generic drivers click next you will get a scary message about the software you are installing has not passed windows logo testing to verify its compatibility with windows xp yada yada just click continue anyway if all goes right your usb audio device will change to maudio usb uno driver or audio usb uno midi driver or both yes i got it to work but for m audio to have me go through these steps is unconscionable the drivers should install without fuss this is not a true plug and play device not even a plug and pray device it s just stupid giving stars is generous for those who gave or stars maybe you have a mac or maybe you just live right but this is not a great product even though it now works there are some latency problems press a piano key hear the sound a couple of miliseconds later and it sounds a bit muddy i can live with that muddy sound latency issues but a bad install experience does not make me want to purchase an m audio product in the future cheers 
lasted less than a year then simply stopped working after some additional research lacie has a reputation for unreliable drives which i knew ahead of time having bought lacie drive years ago and then stopped typical failure rates of in under a year buy drives from anybody else fortunately all i kept on this disk were system backups and i can simply start using another disk 
can t use shuffle lanyard when using this skin what this product description doesn t mention is that you must use the included speck usb cap when using the skin clear the ball bearing mechanism of the standard shuffle usb caps do not engage when the skin clear is installed on the shuffle since the speck usb cap does not have a lanyard string you re out of luck if you use the lanyard as i do 
quality control the second disc in this package was faulty which i did not discover until i spent two hours recording a movie there was what appeared to be a half inch bare spot on the outer edge of the dvd r not what i expected from memorex which purports to be the best i have switched to maxell 
twice smitten i bought this linksys router on the advice of a salesman at compusa it was what i was looking for and i had had success with linksys products in the past not this time i could not get any of linksys software to recognize the router couldn t ping the router either tech support said it was defective so i returned it to compusa tried again with no success and called tech support th actual call they said it was another defective router two off of the shelf defective ! needless to say returned for a refund 
beware samsung dlp design flaws consumers should be aware of serious design flaws which exist in samsung dlp televisions cooling fans and color wheels are highly susceptible to failing as a non techniocal person i should have no idea what these parts are but alas i bought a samsung dlp expect these to fail within years expect to pay approx to replace the color wheel and to replace the colling fan that is if your service technician can find them in stock anywhere these parts are commonly in a national backorder because of the very high failure rates you should also expect the lamp to fail sooner than advertized many people need to purchase a new lamp between years and some more often than that the lamp costs approx depending on your model but you should be able to replace it yourself without too much difficulty this cost will be in addition to replacement costs for the color wheel and colling fan please remember that these maintenance costs are recurring and you will have to fix them again in another years while i was very satisfied with the quality and performance of my dlp my color wheel failed very early i called tech support to report a grinding noise and was told to turn it off wait minutes and turn it back on like this would fix the problem after doing this for a while the color wheel finally failed actually shattered ! now i am out of warranty and samsung wants nothing to do with me i have even tried ordering the part myself from two different online vendors and they are both backordered indefinitely ! it has been weeks and they have no estimate for when this part will be available samsung cannot even give me an estimate when the supply of replacement parts is expected to meet demand i have had my tv for months and apparently there is a national epidemic of them breaking at the same time i have a samsung plasma which is a beautiful set along with a crt both are wonderful products but samsung is selling dlp lemons and will not stand behind them dlp is a great bargain up front but a maintenance nightmare ! you will pay in the long run and by the long run i mean every years if you still want to purchase a dlp television please buy the extended warranty ! it will save you a ton but you will still have to wait for the circuit city tech to find parts which may take months i expect samsung to abandon their design flaw riddled dlp sector and focus on their beautiful plasma line expect dlp prices to drop even further but please look before you leap 
shipping and handling you charge too much for shipping and handling i would have been better off going to a retail store 
good idea doesn t quite come through this flash drive seemed like a great idea unfortunatly the player has trouble playing most of the music files i transfer to it from my ibook the company says its compatible with apple computers but normally the player will only play a handful of the songs i transfer to it 
chinese made junk save your money i was tempted by the cheap price and got myself a pack they are rated at mah but run out of juice after the digital camera has shot maybe frames my year old panasonic mah in contrast can run the same camera for over a shots i tried these batteries in my mp player and even there it won t supply enough juice after an hr worth of playback it is not that the battery does not hold any charge that it has but it just does not supply the peak current required by most digital devices it seems to be all right for use in a flashlight a set of batteries that will not power a camera will power a flashlight a bit dimly for hours yeah i tested it for the test i had charged the panasonics and the lenmars for the same duration it is not a charger issue i plan to complain to the state consumer affairs department regarding this brand and hope action is taken against shady products which are nothing but rip offsone last tip nowadays the best nimh batteries are made by sanyo it is better to pay times for them than for a lenmar trust me 
not good the lcd is easier to use than the earlier version that relied on audio clips to switch frequency you may have to experiment a good deal to find a position where the signal reaches the car radio adequately like the s rabbit ears tv antennas even then if you are in an are with good fm radio coverage it s going to be hard to find a frequency where this will work mostly you can t use this with a cover on and you ll need a car charger if you want to use it for long the all inone modulator and charger that clips to the docking connector is a better solution 
new and useless bought a new md home charged for hours and never worked ! vendor commented that they recieved a lot of returns on this phone errors say out of range registration failed no line even though other cordless phones work fine on the line motorola referred me to a subcontractor for assistance that never called back so motorola isn t even interested in what their customer problems are ! bought a ghz panasonic kx tgc that is getting stars 
doesn t work with any of my four computers it s bad enough that this doesn t even attempt to be compatible with the mac but we can t get it to work with our pc either there are no instructions for getting it to work in the owner s manual and no help online either it s nice and small and records well but no good to me if the file can t be put onto the computer 
roll the dice this one is a gamble i purchased this item and one month later i still have not received any paperwork i emailed and have not received a reply 
subwoofer has no power literally i have been very disappointed by these speakers i have the series iii ones while the treble sounds fine perfectly clear this system has no bass ! my husband recently bought a set of computer speakers and subwoofer and his setup sounds x better than mine because the subwoofer feeds power off the stereo reciever it s hooked up to and does not have its own direct power supply or amplifier it literally lacks power this subwoofer is the biggest joke ever ! i can barely hear the bass on most things even with the volume cranked up bose products are extremely overrated and overpriced do not waste your money buy something worthwhile for a fraction of the price ! and make sure the subwoofer has its own amplifier direct line to outlet 
do not buy i bought this mp player about months ago and it just stopped working i did nothing to it to provoke it to break it has a year warranty by iaudio so i have spent the last days trying to get a hold of the company but quess what ! they don t exist ! a phone number leads you to a website that dosen t work how convienant for cowon to be ripping off consumers with thier crappy products stay away from all cowon products i just lost dollars 
junk this is an extremely cheap product poor grade of plastic and sound quality is for the lack of a better word gross the earbuds that came with my ipod are times better ! it s on it s way back ! stay away 
not for textbooks i wish i never bought this because it was not sturdy enough for textbooks if you put a textbook on it and turn the page it collapses and or tears the page i wouldn t even use this for a notebook 
watch your back warningthis product is not for users with nforce chipsets i see users complaining that this product hangs and the keyboard acts up you have an nforce chipset on your motherboard if you are a fan of amd and use their processors hence a likely nforce chipset stay away from this product because it will not work right aside from having to install a separate usb card to get it to work which i cannot do for my laptop it has performed quite well i read many reviews about the audio quality and i tend to agree the audio will clip if i turn my pc volume up over the halfway mark this is easily resolved by keeping the volume low and turning your powered speakers up i would hesitate to buy another iogear product in the future without extensive compatability research before hand 
iriver products lack plug and play with macs i have an iriver t and there is virtually no software to support the usb plug and play interface that mac owners have always expected pay a little more and buy an ipod it interfaces with pcs and macs equally well 
save your money dont buy i got this and the rangebooster is a lie it has not boosted any kind of range on my network it also goes in and out of service often i wasted my money on this one 
jbuds ear buds do not reduce ambient noise unfortunately the jbuds were disappointing to say the least purchased after reading reviews of the headphone but after one flight with it i had to return it it did almost nothing to reduce the ambient noise inside the airplane purchased jvc ha fxa for and am very happy with it it has foam ear pieces for far better noise reduction and comfort hope this helps 
may be good but you have to get it working first what company would make a router that you can set up wired and then take it wireless and it won t work incredible my experience mirrored exactly that of many who have already written it just shouldn t be this way when i finally did get it working after tweaking some settings and spending all freaking day on the linksys forum it had virtually no signal in a very modest house i do have to say the their forum is top rate the people were very helpful and very friendly and a great place to turn if you don t want to go through scripted support suppliers product wise a very disappointing experience people wise very good but long gone are the days that you put up with an inferior product because the people are so good 
had pix loss w lexar cards about three years ago maybe four i bought two lexar cfii cards one never worked the other worked but lost all data i wrote to lexar that i had two bad cards they sent me one new card of the same size i gave that to my girlfriend told her to only use it on pix she didn t care about losing i still have my card in a ziplock none of the file removal programs will get the images off i ve used all of them had their file removal tech help give up in this day age of just make the item i am upset but you take your chances do you want the only picture of your great grand mother lost because you used a lexar i wouldn t i use an actual sandisk card myself if they ever lexar made it right i may have written a better review but they haven t so that tells me that they don t care how important are your pictures to you frederic 
i like the unimproved ones better the old koskin design is great i have and just logged on to order one for a friend and am quite disappointed to see the changes so my friend will be getting something else the way the old handle was attached was very cool a selling point plus the mesh in the handle made orderly labeling easy and attractive the old koskin material was pretty cool too if all this has changed find something else no reason to stick with case logic for average stuff you can get no name discount junk everywhere hope case logic reads this 
major design flaws buy kensington version instead i purchased this product but after months of frustrating use wound up throwing it away the first problem is that the structural support of the power tips between the laptop plug and the cord plug is the electrical solder ! the effect of this is that if you use the adapter on the road where it s subject to a lot of plug and unplug and varying mechanical stress the solder breaks you then at best have a tip with an intermittent connection i replaced the tip twice before giving up and getting another better designed adapter the second problem is that when i unplugged the power adapter from the wall it would cause my laptop ibm t to emergency power off unplugged at the laptop plug was fine i understand this to be an issue between the t power system and a surge issue in the adapter i replaced this with a kensington w adapter it looks almost like the same product same oem except they have stronger power tips it also didn t have the power off issue i loved the form factor but the product just didn t work 
don t waste your money this is by far the worst detector i have ever had does not detect even close signals had it in for repair twice still does not work properly gives great false signals and makes a fine although expensive door stop 
there are better options i purchased this case to store my dvds along with the inner and outer liner notes unfortunately the sleeves are only large enough to hold in the inner notes since most of my dvds only had the outer liner notes this case was pretty useless in general the design of the product left much to be desired if by xtreme it means big and bulky then the description is right on 
quite possibly the worst mouse in the history of all mice do not buy this mouse this mouse has given me nothing but frustration the front of the mouse where the buttons are located is extremely low causing a muscle strain in your hand if you use it for long periods of time battery life is horrible like weeks when your mouse is idle for minutes it goes into an automatic sleep mode the manual says to touch the metal lines on the side to revive it but when i do it simply freeze the cursor on the screen so i have to reboot my computer absolutely the worst ! 
cheap materials the tent pops up with wire frame but not all the way it only opens the back drop material is all wrinkled 
epson c dies when you change the ink had an epson c for a while it worked great changed the ink now magenta and blue won t print called customer service they fixed it for free really happy get it back works great decides its out of ink even though there is lots makes me change all the cartridges now the red has a line in it its ok till you have to change the ink

ripped off by sony ripped off by sony just purchased this for my daughter at college it records for less than a hour with the included mb card all higher capacity cards are incomatible and all compatible cards are out of production 
eh it gets the job done but the sound is not even close to the quality of the actual itrips i bought this cheaper transmitter after dropping my itrip and it s definitely worth the price there s also a faint high pitched sound for most of the play when it s set to any station it works but not as well as other similar products 
do not buy it s a ripoff this product does not work period i wrote to them for a refund and so far haven t heard back but in fairness that may be because i wrote on saturday they also shipped the item in the wrong box it was a cell phone charger box this tells me that doing business with these folks for any item is not a smart move especially since given the other reviews they are knowingly shipping a product that does not work at all 
canon sd review this printer prints fast but the quality is poor consumer reports rates it a best buy but i disagree pictures come out very graney and its almost worthless to have a megapixel or higher camera because the quality will not be seen with this printer i do not recommend this printer to anyone i bought the cannon to replace a hewlett packard deskjet c and it was slow but the picture quality was superior to the cannon this purchase was a real dissapointment 
finally got rebate i had all the same rebate issues with this item as others so if you are buying this cd case just because of the rebate please don t i did finally receive my rebate months later after a second mailing in and irate email i just cashed the check and i m crossing my fingers that it actually goes through ! the product itself seems okay i can see if you use it a lot that the zipper might break but i rarely get into my cds so i haven t had that issue yet however i do not plan to ever buy from this company again because of all the rebate run around a very dishonest company if you ask me good luck to everyone else waiting for a rebate 
performance is good but lacks accesories i purchased the creative nano gb at christmas and was impressed with performance and accesories that were included for the price i then purchased the muvo v which is almost identical to the nano but a little larger and has a direct usb plug in for essentially the same price i did not get any accesories a armband skin or belt clip i had to purchase an armband from creative for about what the player cost because was not availiable anywhere else creative also charged my card wrong for the armband so use caution when dealing with this 
not worth it terrible product major vendor issues i bought this product as a gift for some friends following the directions carefully they were only able to get one of the speakers to work and that intermittantly after i got the speaker system back from them i gave it a try bad results worse this time only static from one speaker i double checked to make sure that i had installed everything correctly including making sure that the correct power adapters were attached to the speakers no go and then when i went to return it to the company from whom i bought it in canada i got the royal run around finally after lots of phone calls and mail issues dont get me started on customs issues i returned the product and got the price of the speakers back however no refund on shipping either way which amounted to about total so two things the product is shabby and not worth the price go to sharper image and buy theirs better product cheaper price and never buy anything from amazon com that is not from an american supplier 
slower and full of problems i had the sportrak color for about a year and loved it before i lost it i got the explorist as a replacement at first i didn t like it because they took away alot of the menus and i was afraid of having a proprietary rechargeable battery then i got used to it although it navigates zooms more slowly than my sportrak did what i liked the least was the compass didn t correct itself when i turned without walking like the sportrak did the sportrak moved like a real compass ! i kind of got used to that but after about months of use it started giving me invalid basemap errors when starting up most of the time i have tried the online support with magellan and they have been very slow and haven t helped at all i will be calling them shortly to see if i get any help there there are a few other minor things i dislike such as not being able to modify geocaching waypoints without connecting to my pc i am considering a garmin replacement if magellan can t help me resolve this issue 
worked poorly then broke this thing was a major hassle from the start difficult to set up even for an experienced computer user like me once it was set up it took about minutes to get an ip address every time i connected to it for the non tech savvy that means i would turn on my computer connect to the network then wait minutes to be able to go online even though i was laready fully connected to the device that level of terrible performance is simply unacceptable then about months after i bought it it up and broke dont waste your money on this terrible terrible piece of equipment 
beware of kingston rebates beware of kingston rebates of course i hope your experience would differ if you were to buy kingston product s but mine was terrible i bought a kingston compactflash card that offered a mail in rebate i promptly as in the day after i received the item delivery went to photocopy my rebate certificate and upc code and sales receipt then sent it all on its merry way yes i was well within the rebate period both for the purchase and for the postmark date my purchase was a valid retailer think huge online e tailerthe rebate required sending the entire original upc label which was like the entire outside package for my cf card about the size of  business cards when flattened no problem about two months later i get a letter saying your rebate request was denied because you failed to furnish the appropriate original upc code as required by the rebate offer well now what i can t re send the original it was already in their possession i called and they insisted on repeating what the letter said i re sent my photocopies and they said a photocopy is invalid proof of purchase after another weeks of pursuing this i figured this is their scam they simply wouldn t honor the rebate and without the original upc in my possession i couldn t really submit to their requirements if you re looking for a ram upgrade i d suggest you look at a quality company like ocz the best ! or patriot geil or corsair if you re looking for a value flash memory card i might suggest sandisk for one kingston does not make the best products they are value driven products two there are competitors to kingston with just as good or better value toperformance ratios at the same prices three kingston will not stand behind their customer as i have experienced i urge you to please be cautious of kingston and their rebate scams 
i should have listened to the bad reviews i read the bad reviews of the rv and ordered it anyway figuring that a company like linksys cisco would fix such glaring problems quickly bad assumption as a software quality assurance engineer i m pretty tech saavy but after two days of wrestling with the quickvpn i could still not get it to work the problem is one of documentation their information on troubleshooting the quickvpn is not helpful at all which is too bad because otherwise the product appeared first rate the web configuration interface is very intuitive and easy to use i was able to get the basic router firewall working with my custom firewall rules in a few minutes if you do go ahead and buy the rv i would suggest that you plan on hiring someone who has used the rv before to configure it for you the firmware version of my rv was and the version of my quickvpn client was by the way when you review products like this it is very helpful to readers to include the version numbers so they can see if the problem may have been fixed 
high capacity low cost but slow fairly inexpensive when i purchased this for last summer if i waited until now for the same price i could get a cf card in non hard drive version for the same price which i would suggest over this the unit is very slow and the hard drive base unit takes alot more power from your machine i use this with my dell axim xv and though it works the battery consumption is very noticable also the speed of the drive is definately not the fastest like i said above for the that i paid summer of it was a great deal but as all things prices drop and if i had to do it over i would skip this and go for flash based unit 
don t buy this loser for this should be a much better remote if you watch movies in the dark you have to use the glow button guess what you will have to replace the batteries once a month at least also logitech has over simplifed the remote you can t program individual buttons you have to use their program that only allows you to program devices and not the remote directly if you have to go into the device menu a lot you will not be able to control the volume unless you switch to the device that controls volume why not have an option to program each button period but the remote is useless now because of the low battery life do not buy this unless you want to buy batteries every month ridiculous only remote i have ever had like this 
what a piece of junk i was tempted by the low price of this item the only reviewer before me gave it a star rating although aware of the unreliability of a single review i decided to gave it a shot and paid for shipping no other way since it s sold through a third party later i was holding the biggest i ve seen in a while ! the construction feels very cheap and the instruction manual makes absolutely no sense as if written by a year old and the worst of all only one of the two microphones worked even the one that works is horrible the sound out of the speaker is very weak unless you cup your hand around your mouth and the mic it uses a volt battery in each of the two mics and that s another bucks out of my pocket you know what i ll probably have to eat the since the seller does not refund any shipping charges and charges a hefty fee for returns well i learned a lesson things are cheap for a reason 
epson ink clog problem i have used a cx card reader scanner printer combo for weeks after consecutive days of no use prints were streaked like horiz striped shirt blue and black are clogged and running utility many times improves but does totally cure the problem shows ink at all colors black i have bought no new carts so these are absolutely factory epson cartriges if you have to run utility every time you want a quality print even if it did work that s no bargain recomend avoid all dura ink printers until they get dry head bugs out of ink formula heads 
avoid this access point i bought this to support just users in a section of a small branch office that was too cumbersome to hardwire unless you want to blow your credibility as a network admin don t put this device in your network it continually drops connections i have the users trained to unplug this thing when it decides to quit working which has been at least twice a week but now it s every day sometimes twice how embarrassing is that to have your users have to unplug one of you devices because linksys didn t even have the commonsense to let you reboot it from the web interface ive only kept this thing around because i ve been waiting for a firmware upgrade current version is year old at the time of writing can t wait any longer i m about to lose my job worst network component ever 
low quality looks very cheap i bought of them one for me and another for my fiancee it looked pretty good deal when the product arrived i was so dissapointed that i decided to return them immediately the looks and feel is very cheap the sleeves doesn t seem to be of nice quality it feels like they may get torn or come out of its place any time i then looked for case logic made of koshin they are pretty good another good one is slappa they have hard case like structure i got them at pretty low price at buy comyou may also find good ones at meritline com with coupons and stuff i love amazon they took it back without any fuss i wouldn t recommend this item 
polk s are awesome i read the other reviews and was worried about the bass output but not to worry ! i hooked these up to my new denon receiver and adjusted the bass and treble manually instead of the default settings and these speakers are awesome ! i can hear all kinds of background sounds and the bass is just fine ! make sure you buy them on line listen to them at a store to see what you are getting but buy them at amazon and save great buy 
cd changer died can t get a replacement part for warrantee like many others here my cd changer died after a couple of weeks and it wouldn t read any cd it s in for repair but they say the changer part is on national back order and they don t know when they will be available no surprise i guess given the number that are breaking the jvc parts web site says the changer is not available for more than weeks i hope they will replace my unit with something that works 
weak midrange worse bass i puchased the ls s to get a decent speaker for a great price i was disappointed i knew the bass response would not be astonding but it was almost non existant the midrange and the highs are scratchy i would not recommend the speakers for anything other than talk radio 
good and bad there is problem with this tv and i had to return the price is lowest of somewhat of in store and free delivery service of amazom is excellent fast free and professional i will stay with amazon as long as they have the one i want 
just come in handy solo para aclarar sera imbecil el ke pide luces por esta fuente xq de fabrica no las trae asi ke esperemos ke ese tipo de comentarios no se repitan para esa gracia mejor se buska otro tipo de fuente mas colorida salu 
bait and switch don t purchase this if you re expecting to get a mah power acd battery they sent a mah digicom battery instead 
likes and dislikes i have now owned the for weeks i enjoy being able to put in an address and follow it it has benefitted me and i have yet to use it to the maximum level possible i must admit i have yet to read the book the bad is that it does not accept all addresses i use yahoo to map out sometimes to compare the address that yahoo will map out will not necessarily input to the magellan the second bad point is the loss of signal at key times cloudy days and winter as we have now do not go well with the magellan several times it has taken forever to pick up or reconnect to the signal third don t always believe the on what side of the street an address is located or a turn must be executed overall i would still buy at the price i paid it is worth the price as a playtoy in the auto to assist in driving the other bad point is the 
rma in one month good price for portable hard drive you don t have to use this as a sync it can be for storage dont know what other reviewers were smoking loved it as a backup and pc toolkit i put all software i need to fix others machines and for business software and gig itunes backup seriously used it times and now it is dead light goes on but must have been a bad hard drive to begin with started rma process and am waiting on replacement wd have had some serious reliability issues for years so it did not surprise me nice package if it still worked hoping my nd one will be a good one also i suggest using this for on the road backups not as your main backup as it may not be reliable enough for that purpose 
waste of money i bought these discs at compusa because i needed a few before i got the ones i ordered online well i just wated a good bucks because out of discs i got one that burned good not much bang for the buck i have burned many discs but never memorex usually verbatim or ridata or mam very disgruntled with these discs making coasters maybe my burners don t like them but whatever the case i won t buy them ever again i thought memorex made good products 
cheap and plastic y this item is not worth it looks like a cheap plastic child s toy very disappointed sent it back 
dwl g is a piece of crap do not buy this for your xbox it sucks the unit was functional well not defective and by dialing in to the unit it was able to communicate with and w o wires with my computer the first red flag was when the xbox did not recognize the dwl g as a wireless adapter this is normal it has to be configured with an ip address which is ridiculous because the wired router connection is normally plug and play however no amount of configuration in the xbox dashboard would allow the xbox to connect wirelessly this was even with the assistance of tech support which is spotty at best the folks are nice enough but getting through can take a very long time i m okay with networks all of my other stuff works great but definitely not an expert and i could go on and on about the changes i made i won t though if you prefer painless set up it s probably best to match brands when designing a wireless network i ll give d link the benefit of the doubt and admit i was using a router of a different brand but with all of the configuration options on both ends this should not matter oh and i read some of the earlier reviews and i agree that this thing runs real hot who knows what that ll do for the product s longevity because i don t plan to keep it if i ever got it to function properly and i had small children then i d probably mount it out of their reach 
scratched my macbook as long as its on it will prevent scratches but its tough to get off and that act can scratch your laptop it scratched my macbook when i pried it off the guy at the apple store who snapped it on a macbook beause i requested a demo couldn t pry it off and after embarassing minutes he called a colleague over and they pried it off together and to be honest this makes the mb look ugly kinda like putting a veil on a supermodel 
sony stealing people s money do not buy this tv i bought it in february and it has a lot of backlight bleeding all over the screen this is terrible i called sony they had technicians come over to my house they say this is normal they refuse to fix or replace the tv after i spent on this set im so dissapointed and feel robbed ! 
great sturdy usb key ruined by u this is a great sturdy little usb key smooth edges will not scuff against clothes or anything else in your pocket handy keychain loop spaces out the usb key from the other stuff on your keychain so it doesn t all bunch up and stick out the usb connector is protected by a self contained sheath which slides easily and sturdily locks into place when both fully retracted and fully exposed as advertised it s nearly uncrushable the case is made out of solid metal only the sheath slider is plastic and that s recessed so it won t bear the weight of any crush the usb key itself has a good speed when reading and writing data the one fatally bad mistake that sandisk made uthis piece of feculent malware infects all computers used with the usb key it stays around even after the usb key has been removed it gets in the way of simply trying to use the usb key to hold data it s known to crash or lock up many computers it can t be formatted or deleted by normal means as u appears to the computer as an additional drive letter that is strictly read onlyu can t be uninstalled unless fully installed in the first place which means that it s easy to get stuck in limbo neither fully installed nor fully uninstalled rendering the usb key unusable i wouldn t be surprised if they purposely make it difficult to uninstall since u has the power to sneakily install software behind your back whenever it is inserted there s got to be a temptation for sandisk to take some cash from a spammer or two who wouldn t want the opportunity to silently install some spyware from an unsuspecting user s usb key if you want to enjoy having a computer on a stick with applications and data entirely contained on the usb key so you can always carry your favorite programs with you you can get this right now for free you don t need u at all it s at portableapps com enjoy ! 
still can not get to operate on internet a virtual nightmare with set up no help from their support staff on phones nor online q a poorest choice i ever have made in a product ! i am a savvy computer type with network experience and this one for the books item still sitting where i left it useless 
no vista support unlike many people writing reviews of the product i haven t even been able to install the software as it doesn t support windows vista

poor product and terrible support i wish i had read the other reviews before buying this product indeed it does not work on my winxp pc the program will not even open and run the magellangps com site has a downloadable patch for the product but it did not work either what a waste of time and money if magellan ever answers my support requests i hope they will send me a working copy of the program 
what a waste first off the ipod jiggles no matter what you do secondly it doesn t stay straight on the power plug it constantly tilts the whole thing not worth 
totally failed to perform one of them arrived damaged on the printer head so did not even print one page the other one did not print as many pages as i d expected besides the color fades away too fast contacted the company without any reply you d better go for the genuine hp product 
blah it looks like i bought this unit based on the very positive reviews only to come back and see the few less than positive reviews that are brand new i ve had this happen on several products now from amazon product has a lot of good reviews i buy it and by the time i go back to review it there are several non positve reviews makes you wonder if some are being written and scored by people involved with the products some of the review sound like sales pitches and brochures and i personally question if these are real consumers not that i necesssarily think that happened here i bought this unit to and just received in so far i am disappointed in it as well but i m not ready to throw in the towel with it yet the interface takes some getting used to but i don t find it that horrible compared to others some gps have excellent user interfaces but most just seem average to below average and the x fits in there too so i would say its interface is just as bad as most are there are only a few units with very good interfaces imo the poi in this unit seem ridiculous michelin tries wantsisoffers travel type services in general and i thought this unit would be packed with tons of accurate pois points of interest not really maybe i expected too much here but i think their pois are dismal and very dismal if they are a travel services company this unit should overflow with poi and again its just about average though i will say again there are onl a couple of very good gps unit and then there is all the others so this unit fits in with all the others imo its directions are not fabulous so far either any route from my house actually has me drive a circle around my block i have not found any route from any point in my city where the quickest or shortest route is any different and i know of shortcuts it also wants to route you to the most major interstate and streets even if a less major put acceptable roadways are closer and shorter for example from my house to work it routes me miles west to catch the north south interstate to get me to the west east interstate there is a major road that gets me to the west east interstate less than a mile to my east though shorter distance and quicker drive time same on my work to home route it routes me miles past two major roadways in order to stay on the interstate and it does this regardless of choosing quickest or shortest the interstate may be quickest with no traffic but it is definately not shortest it does attempt to tell you what lane to be in on the interstate but its been the wrong lane for me about of the time is due to outdated maps seems just wrong ive tried it for some in city driving where i already knew the routes and its routes did get me there but were not the best or shortest route i expect a gps to actually return a shortest route when i ask for it so far all the directions i ve selected the shortest route and the quickest route are identical i am headed on a several hour drive in a couple of weeks and will see how it goes there like the other reviewers the speaker is ridiculous at the out of the box volume level the speaker is distorted and crackly its not loud enough with windows open vents on medium or with a carfull of conversation its adequate if you are concentrated on following its directions the screen itself is decent i don t have a big glare issue and the unit responds to my commands ok the mount is adjustable so glare can be avoided the unit seems to respond quickly to commands i don t think this unit calculates routes or picks up your gps position extremely quickly it seems about average there too i ve used some other gps and i would not say they are much better so maybe my expectation is too high again there s the very high end and then everything else and this fits in with everything else overall i am disappointed but i may keep the unit because i need a gps and i don t see one that seems much much better maybe my expectations are too high but i don t think they are the mios garmins magellans etc all have pros cons and none seem to hit the target completely on price function accuracy interface etc they all have their quirks and from playing with several the key items of speed and accuracy don t seem much different i tried a friends mio x and if i were to review it my review would sound worse than the michelin ive also used a garmin and other than perhaps the user interface my review of it would not sound much different so this seems to be par for the course for the gps i did not look at higher priced units because i m just plain not interested then i was really only willing to spend up to on one so my choices were cut down to just units really anyway though i did review some of the and sales units up to your choices are the mio cx michelin x and a nextar model i don t think any one is appreciably better than the other so its a dart shootif your expectations are high and you need want a gps now with the low end price target then all of these are about the same with their own set of quirks if you don t need want a gps now then i would personally wait for the low end units to be improved they are not worth it nor do i think the higher priced models are until they improve 
do not use as boot drive i recently purchased this item and i was extremely disappointed it was a horrible experience trying to install this item the instructions for the drive did not match the type of drive and on the western digital website it didn t even list this drive to get instructions for so i followed the instructions that came with it to a t to install the drive as a boot drive copying all my information from my current drive which was about to fail it seemed to copy the files just fine and work ok as a slave drive but then my original hard drive failed and i moved this supposidly boot drive to be the single drive on my machine it would not work upon calling customer service to find out what was wrong i was asked did you make the boot drive through windows or dos i told her i just popped in the disk they gave me and ran it and followed the instructions click on i want to make a boot drive and not on i want to make a drive for additional service she said that it sounds like i did it through windows mode and it won t make a boot drive in windows mode only if i was in dos mode i asked her why this was not explained in the instructions and now i had no original boot drive to try to do it again she told me to run windows recovery i asked if she could help me do that because i couldn t figure it out and she said no windows isn t our product so we won t help you with that i said but if this is what i need to install this drive it says you are supposed to offer me free installation help for days why won t you help me then i was spoken to as if i was a problem customer you know maam i told you i can t help you in a nasty tone i ended up going out buying another hard drive to use as my primary and then installing windows from scratch and having to reinstall all the drivers and programs i had on this new drive and i kept the western digital drive for a backup all in all i thought this was a waste of money a waste of hours upon hours of time and a terrible experience i would never recommend purchasing this product 
not well made hard to use already broken i think this is a waste of money i wanted a cheapie cd player for my daughter to listen to cds havent even had it for three months and it is broken the cd drive now shows no disc no matter what we do unfortunately i can t return it because of amazon s return policy buy something else 
the touch screen sucks i bought this organizer cos i saw the previous reviews saying its cheap and good but it really sucks when i first used it the touchscreen of the organizer isnt sensitive and too hard to key in the alphabets i want second the word structure on the screen is arranged in an awful and confusing way and its hard to read what u have just written i seriously dont recomend this product to anyone 
wrong picture amazon update amazon fixed the problem talk about misinforming your customers amazon ! the model in the picture is completely different and much better than what you are actually selling 
creative s horrible customer service i really wanted to love this little player and for the first days or so i did i like the ipod too but i m a big emusic fan and i wanted a very portable player for my workouts that i could play my music with absolutely no digital rights management with the exception of the always klunky creative software i loved this player great form factor good sound and pretty easy to navigate now the really bad news while hooked up to my computer one day it simply stopped working i could not turn it on a completely dead unit o days or so after purchase i contacted creative and that is when i started to feel like i was hooked up to a machine that repeatedly kicked me in the groin first i had to undergo about a week of back and forth emails trying to get me to fix what i knew was an unfixable problem they strongly suggested i return it to the reatiler but amazon said it was not returnable finally i recieved an rma number then i packaged up and shipped at my expense their defective product after another week they contacted me and now it is time for me to pay a rma fee that is what you have to pay them for their defect so they give you a number to call toll free i think not unless you live in stillwater ok open on weekends to process their excessive fee think twice so that is where i am right now in the creative customer service jail certainly the detainees at guatanamo bay are getting better treatment hopefully they will ship me a new player that doesn t break again immediately these guys will never be able to compete by treating their customers with such disregard 
compatible i am sure this product works wonderfully with most devices however with my panasonic sv sd mp player this product was not compatible i could still transfer files to it but it could not be formatted to sd audio support 
old technology from emerson research i used to have this same unit under the brand name emerson research it s a pretty good unit but it s a very old model for the price you can get a much more modern one from emerson research at a local store 
received bad service amazon fail to deliver item within a reasonable time the item fail to arrive and therefore we never received the good 
try something else i bought a garmin rino specifically for a mountain climbing trip to mt fuji and the altimeter compass and go to features failed even manually recalibrating the altimeter to posted altitudes proved futile because the successive readings would soon be off i checked my rino reading meters to a signpost reading meters i re calibrated the rino to meters and climbed for minutes and my rino s new reading was meters the goto feature took me back down to the wrong rest station that i had stored on the way up in tokyo the electronic compass was degrees off even after recalibration on the island of hokkaido the rino failed to find enough satellites either there are super secret bases on the island with gps jammers or i passed through a wormhole to the twilight zone i hope garmin aviation products fare better i got a refund 
poor sound quality the outgoing message that i tried to record sounded terrible so i have to use the default outgoing message to delete a message you hit the on off button not very intuitive as sometimes it just shuts the machine off if your timing is not right i ve had it for over a year it works fine but i m looking to replace it for something of better quality that s easier to use 
satisfactory but too slow this dvr works ok but when it is recording forget about changing channels it is really really slow and takes like forever to even receive any remote clicks broadband feature is nice but usb doesn t come cheap its like 
won t play after months i purchased this boombox for my daughter s room basically we put in a cd at bedtime and set the sleep timer for minutes not heavy or detailed use i bought this unit because of the timer after months when you push the play button either remote or manually the machine would sporadically play the cd usually after or no disc errors and a power shutoff it would eventually play now it s completely a no disc error message of course sony s warranty person explained that it s a day warranty imagine that ! a complete waste of my money if i d have wanted a cheap machine to last a few months i would have bought one i paid extra for this one so it would last ! i ll be hard pressed to buy sony again 
great looking case design lousy implementation the netgear sc storage central device holds a lot of promise and offers a nice looking case design in fact i referred to mine as a network toaster since that is kind of what it looked like unfortunately beauty is only skin deep when it comes to this unit netgear did get some things right the ability to buy just the enclosure and add your own hard disks is great anyone who has worked on computers for some time will undoubtedly have some perfectly serviceable hard drives sitting around this unit gives you the ability to put at least some of those drives to use installation and use of the device when it works which it doesn t always do are both easy and definitely geared to new and inexperienced computer users who just want something that works what netgear missed with this device however is the ability for more advanced users or people who have multiple computers with different operating systems to take this device further it offers no web based interface and no file sharing protocols outside of the proprietary software for windows xp only this is a serious flaw to an otherwise great idea the hard drives are also loose inside the device when you install them there s nothing to hold them in place or keep them stable other than some blocks of foam i could see this leading to electrical shorting from the circuit board on the drive to the case and even serious disk damage in the event that this unit would fall the interior of the case is also quite sharp so watch out not to cut or slice yourself while installing drives or taking it apart to see what s inside all things and limitations considered i returned mine after five minutes of using it it s just too limited for the power user hobbyist or tinkerer if you pay full retail price it s also quite pricey for such a limited piece of hardware if netgear were to come out with a more powerful version that offered true network attached storage functionality i d certainly give serious thought to buying it as it is right now the product was an expensive disappointment to me 
slooooooooow this card is such a disappointment it is soooo sloooooow i use it for my digital camera mp player and ipaq it takes forever to copy anything to and from it 
don t buy it the product shipped is not the same as the picture apparently this is a common thing for this item 
terrible terrible dvds i bought these disks investing money and trust into the sony name i am sorely dissapointed in this purchase one out of every or disks actually shows up as a disk to be burned meaning that while i spent money on a pack i actually got a or pack absolute trash do not buy this 
maybe ok for a smaller room i found this unit to be unacceptable for my large living room it failed at about feet or so and i had to return it panasonic claims feet range 
good tool for archos but at very much cost its a good accessory for archos product i have wifi its compatible with generation archos devices pros good build enough connections to expandcons it very much costly as compare to it utility it comes with charger which should be a part of standard item there could be more cables included in this package like spdif usb mini cable in this cost it could have a backup battery extra that could be part of built in the docking station so that archos device can have longer play time i think archos has a built in mentality of making as much as money they can if it is then it would not go a long 
beware samsung dlp design flaws consumers should be aware of serious design flaws which exist in samsung dlp televisions cooling fans and color wheels are highly susceptible to failing as a non techniocal person i should have no idea what these parts are but alas i bought a samsung dlp expect these to fail within years expect to pay approx to replace the color wheel and to replace the colling fan that is if your service technician can find them in stock anywhere these parts are commonly in a national backorder because of the very high failure rates you should also expect the lamp to fail sooner than advertized many people need to purchase a new lamp between years and some more often than that the lamp costs approx depending on your model but you should be able to replace it yourself without too much difficulty this cost will be in addition to replacement costs for the color wheel and colling fan please remember that these maintenance costs are recurring and you will have to fix them again in another years while i was very satisfied with the quality and performance of my dlp my color wheel failed very early i called tech support to report a grinding noise and was told to turn it off wait minutes and turn it back on like this would fix the problem after doing this for a while the color wheel finally failed actually shattered ! now i am out of warranty and samsung wants nothing to do with me i have even tried ordering the part myself from two different online vendors and they are both backordered indefinitely ! it has been weeks and they have no estimate for when this part will be available samsung cannot even give me an estimate when the supply of replacement parts is expected to meet demand i have had my tv for months and apparently there is a national epidemic of them breaking at the same time i have a samsung plasma which is a beautiful set along with a crt both are wonderful products but samsung is selling dlp lemons and will not stand behind them dlp is a great bargain up front but a maintenance nightmare ! you will pay in the long run and by the long run i mean every years if you still want to purchase a dlp television please buy the extended warranty ! it will save you a ton but you will still have to wait for the circuit city tech to find parts which may take months i expect samsung to abandon their design flaw riddled dlp sector and focus on their beautiful plasma line expect dlp prices to drop even further but please look before you leap 
would be great if it worked i have purchased the gb drive because of what a lot of you said the space the size and the convience of not having a power supply i only wish it would work i have tried for the past month with no success to get mine to work even with both usb plugs attatched my computer finally today recognized it for the first time but it freezes it up and will not allow you to utilize it i have tried their customer service with no help or resolve i have even tried to get a dc power cord and was told just to send the unit back i just wish it would work i have a newer lap top with xp so i don t know what the problem is i am glad it is working great for others because it seemed like such a great thing 
prevented the computer from booting the hub prevents the computer from booting search on the web found that numerous others had the same problem belkin was unable to provide any support and it seems the only solution is to purchase a different hub the hub is nicely designed and works fine once the computer is booted and the unit is plugged in 
less than pleased although the radio still works the searchlight illuminated only once the first time i turned it on it hasn t worked again since the radio works while plugged in unplug it and come back in an hour and no more charge i used the hand crank i cranked that handle for well over a minute when i pressed the on button the radio didn t work this radio is worthless in an emergency i give it one star because this radio does work while plugged in plus the dial is well lit illuminating the stations in blue light 
defective cable i bought this cable to connect plasma tv to computer when we connected the cable with tv we could not get it to display computer screen we spent hours with plasma manufacturer on telephone troubleshooting the connection at the end at our dissapointment we found out that the cable was defective when we tried different cable everything worked 
be an educated consumer ! you don t have to spend a lot for digital cables you don t have to spend a fortune on expensive cables when you are dealing with digital signals keep in mind that all digital interfaces have error correction built into them did you know the internal components of consumer electronics are connected with tin and nickel there s no gold inside ! so there s no need for oxygen free gold tipped multi sheilded super mega supreme cables if you don t believe me buy this cable and a no name cheapie compare them for yourself you will see no difference with analog signals a good quality cable may make a difference although the difference is usually only visible on an oscilloscope 
does not work on vista does not work on vista sooooo disappointed because my laptop sound completely disappeared with vista upgrade save for the windows startup music i thought this new sound card would bring my sounds back might have but it says not compatible with vista i guess i ll be getting a new computer 
i dont like this mouse i dont like this mouse i brought and never work its useles 
does not work with shuffle despite the product description and even the box packaging ! the claim that this product works with the shuffle is incorrect it does not work with the new tiny ipod shuffle it only works with the old stick form factor shuffle so cool design looks and sounds great but does not work as advertised 
ginormous waste of money i have purchased three of these dvd players in the past years every one of them has had the same problems trouble reading dvds dvds skipping discs freezing and the manual buttons stopped working on two of the units the price is right on the unit but not for the time it worked i would have been better off spending double or triple the unit price to get one that worked for more than months without a problem if i could give it less than star i would because thats really what it is worth nothing 
sony battery the battery life does not even come close to the advertised listing save your money and wait until sony does a better job i am a big fan of all things sony and this is my first big disappointment mar 
do not buy this the screen is terrible when view movies through the ipod picture quality is really bad when compare to the ipod built in screen the dvd feature is ok it does not play divx which is a let down if you are thinking of buying this unit for the ipod integration you will be very dissapointed also the unit itself is very thick and very hard to handle though the picture cleverly hides the thickness of the thing great job iluv s photographer do not buy 
it works as promised but not worth the money being a huge fan of xm i was excited when i saw this product sure it looked bulky but i wasn t going to be moving around much while i used it and i was going to use it only outside the first unit i received worked fine but the volume fm frequency selector toggle snapped off within the first few hours leaving me unable to adjust either this appeared to be a design flaw and as such i promptly returned it without incident i did get a second one and am mindful of this toggle switch i do note that even with careful use the headphones age very quickly and i do not think they will last too long the bottom line is that the product works as advertised but does so at great expense bulk and does not appear to be durable if you can get a much lower price go for it ! 
a real bummer i m a big mac user usually love their products but i gotta say this mouse has turned out to be a disappointment two reasons the right clickleftclick technology has never worked the scroller just stopped working today after owning it for only a matter of months i can no longer stroll down just up and side tosideive just ordered a new mouse 
frustration plus ! flimsy construction instructions which come with this item are woefully inadequate to get a person started everything i tried to make it work with my ipaq pocket pc resulted in building frustration when it still wouldn t work i finally decided to set the keyboard aside and went to fold it back up only it started to break up instead the end of all this was that the keyboard wound up in two pieces roughly on the floor and i will no longer consider any bluetooth keyboard for my ipaq 
came broken and tried it anyway the door hinge was broken so door wouldn t stay on but we decided to try it anyway as we had a th surprise coming up in days and needed it to keep kids entertained ! borrowed my neighbors little hawaiian ice maker as back up the little machine ran circles around this big fancy one this one made snow cone to the snow cones the little machine made in minutes ! very disappointed ! emailed company and still waiting for reply after emails and weeks ! thank goodness i had the hawaiian ice for back up 
nice remote just can t use it before you pick up any harmony series universal remote make sure it s compatible with your isp thats right your isp i spent several hours trying to figure out why i couldn t get past logitech s login screen time after time i received nothing but session time outs and asp errors after diving into their user support forums it turns out these errors aren t that uncommon there seems to be a problem with the way the logitech webservers handle proxies some people have overcome this by switching proxies or connecting through a different isp i ve had no such luck after toying with dozens of different proxy servers and my dialup backup why logitech doesn t let their software configure the remote or heck offer the option of manually inputting remote codes is beyond me having to be at the mercy of their servers for lack of a better word just plain sucks 
never could get my computer to recognize this player i have a gb player which i like i wanted a player with more capacity so i ordered the gb model i tried charging the device but it never seemed to take a full charge when i attached the device to my computer i got a message about invalid drivers for the device i looked at their online support and tried their suggestions but it didn t help i talked to creative zen phone support many times they seemed to be more interested in getting rid of me rather than helping me they would send me emails suggesting solutions and hang up as quickly as they could i updated windows motherboard drivers changed registry settings cleaned the drive and reset the device all to no avail i returned one device and got another just to see if the first device was defective it didn t help i tried the phone support again and they sent me the same emails i got before i finally gave up and am now looking at other higher capacity devices 
first amazon disappointment i ordered this item as i have many items from amazon and it did not arrive after two months i cancelled the order 
the worst product ever disclaimer this is my first webcam it may be my last if they re all like this one i ordered this product and received it quickly that is the only good news it is all downhill from there the installation froze and had to be rebooted twice before it would work the second time it also froze but i unstuck one of the reboots and got the other to work the camera itself does not securely latch to a flat screen monitor it falls off easily the microphone headset is flimsy and does not stay on my ear the webcam software freezes over and over and over again it freezes most when trying to hook into yahoo im the only support provided in the tutorial for the broadcast function is quote you must have downloaded yahoo instant messenger for this function to work absolutely no idea how to troubleshoot from that point forward every time i launch broadcast the entire program freezes it gets better even when the program is not frozen it almost always shows a black screen with the phrase the creative webcam is temporarily unavailable the screen eventually shows a brief still photo from the webcam then goes back to black screen i visited the manufacturer s website support has options email i have received no response after hours phone call the website advises looking into your product manufacturer documentation to find a phone number there is none there is a phone number on the website but it charges per call phone support is free if you purchased within days but in order to contact them you have you guessed it find the phone number in your documentation online documentation this is totally useless and did not provide any help for the myriad of problems this product faces in short this is a piece of junk it is already on its way back to the website a combination of shoddy manufacturing buggy software and horrible customer service spells doom 
do not purchase for its xvid divx support the feature that originally sold me on the dsm was its support for the xvid and divx formats these however are the two formats that are supported the least and a slow jerky framerate should be expected i at first thought it was a bandwidth issue and proceeded to hard wire it to my computer using a crossover cable the framerate improved but not enough in my opinion for this device to even claim support for these file types if support for these two formats are the selling feature for you be warned you should look elsewhere 
automatic turnoff is a real turnoff i purchased these headphones a couple of months ago even after reading the negative feedback i wish i would have listened the headphones really do automatically cut off when the music stops or when the audio is at a low level such as a very quite scene in a movie there is also a constant low level hiss in the background i know it is tempting to buy these because of the cheap price but it really is worth it to spend a little more money on a higher quality set of wireless headphones 
still trying to get this player to work i want to believe all of the positive reviews i really do ! but at the moment i m still having problems with the downloading and uploading of the firmware i know i know do it in recovery mode ! whatever that is ! dont worry i ve been to the site and followed the directions times ! and as for customer support i got a message giving hours and good bye i did called during the hours cs was supposedly open i had a mpio and wanted something more reliable but once again find the software package and manual so big and so little information are not intuitive or easy to use maybe the mac nation is right and as for that first review posted here on amazon com i hope that guy got a bonus he must be working for cowan don 
disappointing this is not a dictionary you can download onto your memory card it comes on its own memory card which you have to insert into your pda to use you have to carry this dictionary card around with you and when you want to look something up take your card out of your pda and then insert this one it s impractical for me it was a waste of money 
this tv doesn t exist at least not yet like another person here mentioned this tv does not exist i bought this tv from amazon and they sent me the w version the one without the integrated atsc tuner after almost a month after i bought this thing i m still waiting for my refund do yourself a favor stay away from this hopefully amazon will take down this product listing so nobody else has to deal with this bs 
be forewarned if your thinking of using this with airport express this amazon listing also suggests buying the soundsticks along with airport express if you re thinking of connecting them to the usb port of express apple says it won t work apple airport express faqs 
cool radio but an awful shortwave radio this is a nice radio cool design and nice to keep on your desk and use to listen to fm or am radio stations that s why i m giving it two stars because of design if it wasn t for the the design i wouldn t give it more than one star the reason being that i expect a product especially a grundig product marketed as a shortwave radio to actually be able to pick up some shortwave radio stations i have had this piece for years now and i have still not been able to make it pick up a single shortwave radio station successfully there are about three stations it finds but barely the signal it picks up is so weak one can t hear a single word if you like a nice piece of very well designed radio to keep on your desk or nightstand buy it if you re looking for a shortwave radio look somewhere else 
tearing paper i went through at least half the pack on wasted jammed paper i truly have never had a problem with paper going through my printer but this frankly sucked the stomper software is pretty lousy for bringing in artwork created outside the program but i got that down after two mis registered prints so i thought i was finally in the clear until this cheap backing and paper started ripping in the print feed how hard does avery have to work to make a decent product jut to be clear the original stomper paper that came in the pack worked fine through the same printer so i can only assume the problem is this product maybe they reformulated the product if they manufactured the original probably saves them a buck a pack truly a disappointment and waste of time and ink 
avoid it the quality of sound and manufacture of this unit is unacceptable it was made in china although it has an attractive design the outside is made from the same inexpensive plastic that my panasonic dvr is made from the recorder has two modes sp and ep sp is the highest quality but playback still sounds cheap at the highest quality there also are two microphone settings dictation and conference in dictation mode the microphone can only pick up what is said within about inches the quality is audible but not great conference mode only works when one person is speaking in a completely quiet room something that is not realistic with people shuffling about any background noise will render the recording inaudible even in a quiet room the quality is muffled and unacceptable the high price for this unit definitely is not indicative of its quality which appears to be low i have other less expensive units that are better built and have a higher audio quality i do not understand the other reviews other than to believe someone with less experience using dvrs would have a different expectation perhaps it works better with an external microphone or when used solely in a closed environment such as a quiet closed interrogation room which i believe defeats the purpose of a small pocket sized unit meant to be carried around a mb xd card gives hours in sp mode or hours in ep which would be great if the product worked similar to other brands the controls are not intuitive but can be learned easily and are not a drawback 
broke without warning i bought this adapter because i could use the cable that came with ipod one fewer thing to carry well about six months after opening this item i noticed that my ipod was running on battery one of the contacts had broken and the device was not working anymore i am disappointed but should have expected that for the i spent 
some time you get a lemond this wireless speaker system failed to work right out of the box however i had not problem with the return which included return postage i will purchase from amazon again 
short lifespan o k i purchased these batteries over a year ago and only opened the pack now these batteries will not hold a charge and my charger indicates that the batteries are past their useful lives i don t know what the normal lifespan of rechargeable batteries is but these didn t last being on the shelf for a little over a year i will never buy this brand again 
serious drop in quality i have always been a fan of sony because they make quality products that are userfriendly that is why i was in a state of complete shock that this little blue cd walkman is made by sony because it is on the other end of the spectrum compared to what they usually manufacture first the bad the control buttons sound changing tracks pause etc are tiny and nearly impossible to read i found myself having to hold the cd player up to my face to find the right button and i do not have any vision problems the little lcd screen is hard to read as well next the sound quality is poor and has a cheap watered down feel to it then there are the stock headphones that the product comes with these are cheap and don t fit well i bought a yellow psyc sony walkman a couple years ago and that one is times the product that this one is the sound is near perfect and the buttons are easy to see and use the headphones fit well and the whole package has lasted with no issues at all i wouldn t write sony off simply b c of this product but i would definitely do some research prior to purchasing a walkman from them 
can t really recommend this unless ya want a pretty light i ve had this product in my windowed lian li pc for about months now i had bought it for reasons to light up my case and to help cool my gt now the former it does pretty well it is impressive to look at through the window and it s easier to install than a cold cathode light however as an intake fan it seems to bring in more dust than air and my pc is in a finished basement that i try to keep tidy at any fan setting other than low the vcool s fan noise is noticeable over my other fans aerocool mm mm thermaltake silent cats and the mm cooling my enermax liberty psu especially on the highest setting but over the past month the vcool has started to do something particulary annoying at bootup the vcool would rev up to a very high speed regardless of the setting on it s fan control the first time it did it i thought a cable had snarled into one of my case fans thats how loud it is i don t have the vcool hooked up to another fan control and i m just using a standard molex connector to power it and there s a free pci slot between it and my gt so there s no obstruction to cause the racket i m at a loss for the cause of it s behavior it only did this sporadically at first but within the past week it has become a guarranteed occurance from a cold boot the fan does quiet down eventually but i feel the noise it now generates the fact that the intake is unfiltered along with the fact that i now have an arctic silencer for my video card the vcool can t reach the intake of the cooler even with it s extension attached outweighs whatever decorative purpose it had 
memory stick i could not make my computer recognize it so therefore it is useless to me 
defect i bought this item and not even three weeks later it quit working the power won t turn on and it completely quits on you don t order it 
does not work easy set up simply does not work i have no ir or rf interference and i set up to debug by puting the transmitter in the adjacent room and placing the receiver directly in front of the unobstructed units feet away cannot get any device to work through this transmitter if i make keystrokes one will get transmitted successfully great concept really poorly engineered 
unreliable rip off this product is cheaply made and noisy the usb power cable developed a problem after days don t get ripped off avoid this unreliable product 
poor support my new nikon coolscan v ed worked very well for the first six hours after i put it in use then the film strip adapter which is needed for most of its operations broke down i shipped it overnight and asked for a replacement under the one year warranty they have had it in their shop for the last three weeks but can give me no estimate of when they might be able to ship me a replacement i would pay the another for a new film adapter if i could be sure that it too would not be likely to break down not my smartest purchase 
buyers beware check your camera model before you buy this these cards only work with camera that supports the write acceleration otherwise the speed is no different from a x card there is nothing wrong with the card in terms of capacity or quality i have given a single star rating coz it should clearly state that the x speed is only possible with cameras supporting write acceleration ! very few camera support this technology and one can easily get the same capacity x at the mentioned price so why pay more if your camera does not support this technology ! 
not happy the picture quality is very good the delay in changing channels is not a big deal usually you will have a satellite or cable box hooked up anyway to avoid the problem ive had this tv for months now and generally very happy until weeks ago for some reason the picture just cuts out after minutes leaving only sound if you wait the picture can come back on by turning tv off and waiting but then it goes off again in a few minutes not happy with the service still waiting for a call back i really wish i had seen these reviews beforehand 
garbage my last uniden phone i ve been disappointed before by uniden so i m not sure why i even botherd with this phone poor quality sound always some delay when pressing buttons too but it s the sound quality that is ridiculous never again panasonic phone or nothing 
beware of shipped an incorrect cable and a cheaper one i ordered this cable and ended up sending it back to amazon and i advised them why the thx cable is not blue the thx cable is blue i called monster cable and got hold of their technical support they said they have never made a thx cable in blue amazon obviously has not followed up on this issue 
an expensive disaster i replaced novi units which had slowly failed over many years of use with reporters attracted by the true wirless nature of the reporter i was willing to spend the extra money over competitve brands unfortunately the quality of the reporter units is extremely poor as all four units failed after only a little ove one year of light use failure modes ranged from no transmit on two units no receive on one unit and completely dead on the fourth unit all with new batteries and resetup per the instructions don t waste your money 
horrible this product is far by the worst cd player i ve ever owned it s takes a while for the songs to read on the cd and the songs will randomly stop while the eye tries to read the disc at first i thought it was just my cd but i changed it through cd s and the same thing happened the anti skip is also terrible like stated above i wouldn t recommend this cancerous cd player to anyone the headphones are also very uncomfortable please don t waste your money 
this is junk and it doesn t last months i got this for christmas last year i hardly use the thing and when i have i have been very careful in placing the ipod on and off of it i can no longer play an ipod on it as there is no sound or too much static apparently a short of some sort i was shocked as it had been used maybe times by my wife and i read all of the reviews i am not the only one who now has an overpriced doorstop save your money and buy something else take your time and read through the cotton candy reviews which bump this up to an artificially high rating of and you will see one consistent pattern the connection to the ipod is very poor the alarm doesn t function and they feel it is overpriced 
there are better remotes i have several sony products tv stereo vcr and yes they all work wonderfully with this remote didn t even have to program those devices the problem i had was when i tried to program my dvd player there were only codes for other brands ! i have dvd players and this didn t work on any i decided to upgrade an older memorex model with a new sony yes it did work but some of the functionality was quirky if you press the dvd function button while the dvd is on the remote will turn it off so if you want to switch from the stereo or tv functions back to controlling the dvd you d better put your hand over the transmitter or it will shut off the dvd player while your watching it didn t even work with my genaric analog cable box 
faulty driver i bought this drive only a few hours ago saved very important documents to it and all of a sudden it doesn t want to open on me it states that the drive needs to be reformatted doing this would cause me to lose all of my data terrible i warn you not to buy this product not worth it 
looks good and sounds canned i bought this one because of the good reviews here and i was very very disaponted it has more bass compared with most of the other speakers of the similiar size but the problem is that the music is twisted in order to empasize bass sounding like from a can i returned it and bought a klipsch promedia and there is simly no comparison its not fair to reqire this kind of tiny speakers to perform but the bose s problem is to use a price tag to impress the buyers in stead of focusing on quality i believe some of the reviewers here are just new to home audio i still remember how i was excited when upgrading my oem dell speakers to a entry level system for the first time well if you do not believe me just buy a pair of klipsch promedio and see for yourself if bose worths even

total p os don t waste your money on these things ! you can get a far better pair of headphones for comparable or less money spent these things are nothing more than a marketing scheme to sell a look and fashion accessory these headphones sound terrible and are very uncomfortable total p os 
was great then broke first i rated it great and it was for two movies then it broke and the picture was scrambled and rolling the end 
great service if you never plan on canceling i have been a subscriber for years back in november my account was turned off due to a billing issue the week prior to it being turned off i started receiving calls a day for payment i advised one of the reps to wait a week for the payment payment was made calls stopped for another week the radio was then turned off and the calls a day started up again i explained to the bill collectors i owed nothing and when offered to reactivate the radio i told them not to bother at this point i wanted nothing more to do with xm they offered me months of free service to come back anyone who cancels can get this by the way and i refused the calls a day continued for the next week i was informed that it simply takes a week for your name to fall out of their automated system more months go by and then i start receiving a bill saying that i reactivated my radio and owe for months of service and all the late fees that go with that dollars i call in and state i never reactivated my radio thus i don t owe for reactivating my radio and the months of service that would have followed the customer service rep told me that it would be taken cared of weeks later i get another bill i call back and the rep tells me the same thing and apologizes for my inconveniences i even called back the next day just to make sure it was finally resolved and that rep confirmed that i no longer owed anything so then last month i start receiving collections notices you have one month to pay this before it goes to collections i called in and was promised they would look into it and call me back this apparently has taken care of the issue though i never received the call back this week i called times of which i was promptly hung up on for no reason and was told each time that it had been resolved so hopefully this time it really is to anyone considering xm i suggest you just get an mp player 
cheap not inexpensive the principal benefit of this product is in the valuable lesson it teaches not to buy the lowest price item without first taking a good look at the product reviews i was never able to get the card to do anything i tried removing and reinstalling the drivers i tried getting assistance through the web site i tried contacting the manufacturer and they never returned my phone call i ve decided to cut my losses and buy a different card 
befvp and microsoft pptp servers as you may have read elsewhere this router has a problem with the gre protocol used by microsoft for their pptp server see alan bryant s may review this will stop you using it with the built in pptp vpn client server which is provided with windows xphere is the text of a complaint i have submitted to linksys i am attempting to operate a microsoft pptp server behind a befvp firmware i have pptp pass through enabled and port forwarded to the fixed ip address of the server but the router refuses to pass the gre protocol used by microsoft protocol in answer id you suggest forwarding port presumably in a belief that this has something to do with gre it does not and is therefore not the solution to this problem gre does not use tcp udp port it is protocol something entirely different it seems that the the writer of answer has neither tested this scenario nor has a true understanding of the nature of this problem i and others have investigated this problem extensively using protocol analysers at the client and server ends and can only conclude that the present version of firmware in the befvp is incapable of handling the gre protocol correctly can you please advise when a fix will be implemented this is seriously devaluing an otherwise good product i also suggest that you amend answer as it is misleading and will frustrate others less versed in ip protocols than myself i await a reply from linksys as i write this review having said all that if you have no interest in running the microsoft pptp server the befvp may do everything else you require it functions okay as a basic nat router and it s stealth capabilities are good steve gibson s shields up reports true stealth as long as you forward port to a non existant host the in built ipsec tunneling works well i am using one to provide permanant tunnels to a number of befsx s very reliably the web interface is a little odd at times but it does do the job reasonably and you do get used to it eventually to summarise a reasonable basic nat router very good stealth ipsec tunneling works okay at least to other linksys products microsofts pptp server will not work with the current firmware version 
print heads are duds i have had this printer for more than a year at first it was a great printer not anymore it uses up ink like no other yes it is great to have the individual tanks which is why i bought the thing but now the print head isn t working right do several deep cleanings and use up nearly all the full tanks up and the problem is still there the pages have splotchy black marks and the texts are only partially printed went to the canon website they don t even acknowledge this printer ever existed my recommendation is don t buy this model ! 
tivoli subwoofer sounds more like a chihuahua than a bulldog i have my tivoli model which i love hooked up through an inexpensive home theater system and it sounds great but sometimes i want to listen to the radio without using the home theater the sound quality is a bit tinny so i decided to try the subwoofer to fill in the low end when i received the new speaker i was impressed with it s eye appealing design i immediately hooked it up to the model and turned it on i didn t hear much difference so i cranked it s volume knob up to the max the bass response improved but just a little bit i guess i ll continue to play the radio through the home theater in summary the subwoofer looks great but the sound quality is disappointing 
horrible software and support after using the printer which is a nice unit i had numerous software related functions that did not work on the printer i called hp for some help but found their tech support to one of the worst i spoke with two different techs who could not solve the problem and told me to contact microsoft i spoke to dell and microsoft who both spent time trying to solve the problem and both agreed that the problem was strictly an hp problem i never solved the problem and returned the printer to amazon for credit i am now using a dell printer with no problems 
bridging use i bought this product to use it as a bridging client in an existing belkin wireless network and it failed to pass any data even though it showed connected to the belkin access point according to the netgear docs this access point can operate as a access point or as a bridging client but what the fail to tell you is that it bridges only in a netgear environment after spending mins on the phone with netgear they told me i needed to buy a different model which is non netgear proprietary or more netgear access points how can a company like this be selling proprietary hardware in todays day and age leon mccall 
nice hardware really bad drivers ever since i loaded the targus drivers on my tungsten c the battery discharges quickly and won t take a full charge ive removed the driver with no change the next step was to do a hard reset of the tungsten c and i m hoping it will take charge im taking this keyboard back for a full refund 
disappointed the good lots of bells and whistles bluetooth mp player custom points of interests nice options for pedestrian and bicycle mode although i am not sure it s waterproofenough if you get stuck in the rain the bad for what you get garmin could have done a better job driving on the freeways insouthern california don t expect to hear the navigated directions with the window down same goes for trying to use the bluetooth in making phone calls that s even with thevolume cranked all the way up i can hear the radio just fine with the windows rolled down although it s a nice thought of adding custom poi s such as for safety cameras out here the directions almost require you to have a technical degree to upload them garmin if you are reading this make it easy on the novice and test your products better if someoone wants to add a custom poi make it easy by having an icon that will automaticallylog the location you are at as a custom poi also do a better job of testing the products for volume controls with the windows up and downin various traffic areas conjested or not 
sent me the wrong cable don t buy from this company i was not sent a firewire cable as was advertised they sent me a useless usb cable when i contacted the seller they did not send me the proper cable don t buy from this terrible company ! 
garmin zumo excellent gps goes from car to bike to handheld easily easy to use i wish i had this on my last crosscountry trip 
intel mac users beware intel macs running the current version of mac os x are incompatible with this router the configuration page does not render properly on any of my three macs regardless of whether they use a wired or wireless connection and with the latest airport firmware on the macbook the wpa settings cause a system crash kernel panic dlink technical support was no help i sent them an email with a screen shot from safari and firefox and they responded you shoudl sic be able to do it with safari can you try it in another environment so they didn t properly answer my question and they never responded to my two follow up emails zero stars for tech support the reason i m giving this product two stars is that it did work properly with my windows computers but intel mac users should look elsewhere i did 
problems well i received it and i proceed to install following the instructions really very easy to install i connected avertv cardbus to the cable i did a scan for the cable channels it worked for a while and then the blue light of the card turned off and no channels could be see i removed the avertv cardbus from my notebook and blue light came back again for maybe min or less and turned off again it looks that it is maybe damage i think the problem appears when it gets hot i made work the following day and it worked for maybe min and card light goes off again maybe i received one that has problems 
good sound poor craftsmanship it s sounds great for a fm transmitter beware i bought of them each time one of the channels would go out usually in less than a week i liked the sound so much i even made up a splint type thing for the cord nothing works irock if you read these reviews then answer this why would you make the cord so flexible if it was going to cause it to malfunction i would pay ten dollars more if the thing would last got the belkin digital one not the station preset one and it doesn t sound as good but it works for more than a week 
not so great for tracheostomy use this vicks ultrasonic humidifier was thoroughly recommended by everyone when we needed a humidifer with the possible hose attachment that goes to a mask around my dad s new tracheostomy problem is it puts out too much mist even at the lowest setting ! we ve tried everything including taping the hole but it then goes from all to nothing because the small hole desired quickly coalesces water preventing steam from passing through of course it wasn t until we started mentioning it to the various rn s that come to take care of my dad that everyone using it for the same purpose complains of the same excessive mist problem so i ve resorted to making large hole cuts in the plastic tubing leading up to my dad s mask not a great way to do it and just asking to be seeded by bacteria but if anyone has a better suggestion i m all for it even if it means suggesting a different humidifier 
cheap product from china i was very disappointed the unit looks like a cheap knock off and the user guide is not adequate not user friendly 
beware read this before you buy this adapter will not work with certain drivers goto pharos website for details i bought this product fought it for hours before i figured this out and had to return it 
haven t actually gotten my real wintv pvr yet no it s not amazon amazon sent me what they thought was a real pvr since hauppauge says so on the box however it has another card in the box fine it s a better card but not what i need so i send it back to hauppauge to get a real pvr that was like weeks ago where is my damn card 
ok this privacy filter is great for an airplane like m advertises but when i m at home and my laptop is on my desk the person standing behind me can see the screen just as well as i can i think it is a bit pricy too if this piece of plastic was around dollars i d suggest buying it 
new cd stomper is terrible i used the original cd stomper for many many years and never had one problem i bought the new version and it s such a huge downgrade why do i have to calibrate my printer when i didn t before even after you calibrate your printer the text still is never perfectly on the label i ve wasted so much ink and labels trying to get this stupid thing centered and it never prints perfectly oh the side tabs never rip off cleanly my cds have to look atleast half way professional when i send them out to clients and it doesn t look too good with tear marks on the each side of the label this product is junk thanks for ruining a great product guys 
didn t work with my system i can t give this an objective rating despite repeated consultations with my computer manufacturer and the software provider i couldn t get this unit to play through my computer so couldn t do any recording i sold it to a friend and it is apparently working with his system conclusion be careful if you buy it it may or may not be adaptable to your equipment 
hardly even zip the case when all disc is in for the price of the rebate it is a good deal though don t expect you get an easy use of the case especially all discs are in case with a big force to squeeze the case together finally able to zip it and you will get probably all the disc bent especially the outer sleeve onesit is a bad design by having the same dimesion sleeves sew together in the center probably having discs case would be more proper instead of disc 
where is it i ordered an hp printer which does not come with a cable on oct th based on advice in the ad for the printer i ordered the subject cable also made by hp in the same order the printer shipped on the th of october an ink cartridge for the printer arrived today nov th but still i still have not received the cable i do not know how to rate the printer or the cable and i have already lost days on the printer s warranty i sure would like to be able to rate the cable and printer to date the order is weeks late since it s estimated shipping date of oct i have not even been able to find a way to contact customer service to see if there is going to be a long lag time in which case i would know that it would be wise to cancel and order from someone else bottom line not satisfactory at the moment 
sounds cool but a big waste of time here s the thing it s not like you magically hook up your device to this and it charges from the sun you use the solar panels to charge a battery which then charges your device so you need to have this thing in the sun all the time to keep the battery charged and then it will take forever to charge whatever device you have as if that s not bad enough it comes with million pieces so it s not exactly as portable as you d hope if you read the instructions the manufacturer is clearly trying to sell this based on some environmental claims you won t be using electricity to charge your ipod but your ipod will take forever to charge you have to carry around the little array the battery and whatever adapters you might need clearly there s a better way to save energy keep your fridge slightly warmer or adjust your thermostat this is a waste of time 
great when it works but i received the printer as a great gift on january th i set it up and it wouldn t print the ink cartridge holder seemed stuck in place i called epson who shipped me out a replacement with no charge or delay i used that printer for two weeks and it quit same problem with the ink cartridge holder once again epson customer service shipped me a new replacement printer it worked for another two weeks and quit on me yesterday same problem so i ll call epson when they open tomorrow and try to upgrade to a new different printer or try once again the printing results are spectacular especially when using epson glossy paper anyone else with problems 
stopped working weeks after christmas my daughter got this for christmas and it stopped working three weeks later ! for the price i expected it to work more than weeks plus i have a very disappointed year old who doesn t have a cd player anymore 
would give it negative stars if i could loud ! loud ! loud believe the reviews i have a mac mini in my upstairs office nice and quiet i have other external drives all fairly quiet this thing sounded like a hair dryer my wife asked me if everything was ok in my office because it sounds like something is about to launch so i updated the firmware per the wd website to lessen the fan noise now the drive doesn t even mount ! i call wd tech support the first guy i talk to chuckles when i mention that the copy on the box claims this drive is remarkably quiet he said yeah not this drive i get transferred to advanced tech support we run some tests and determine that the firmware upgrade essentially killed this drive i can t even get it to power up nice glad i transferred my itunes collection to it guess i get to rerip all my cds my advice look for something else i have other wd mybook drives of smaller capacity that have worked just fine this tb drive sucked from day if you have any kind of drive activity at all the noise will make you crazy i guess it s fine if you want to leave it turned off most the time 
it was surprise for me before i bought this reader i considered models in lexar and sandisk i decided to buy lexar i bought this reader to use mostly with memory stick i have cards mb and gb i had no problem with mb card but i could not insert my gig card into this reader it just did not go i tried hard trying not to break the card no success it was a surprise for me may be because my card was made not by lexar by sandisk i contacted lexar but did not get any explanation of this problem any way i had to send it back and buy in sandisk reader 
horrible quality i bought this product the second time i used it the volume control broke i can t adjust the volume so i returned it for another one of the same model with the manufacturer three days later the same problem the volume control broke horrible quality product the manufacturer should pull the product and address the problem 
buyer beware worked great for about a year of very limited use visit the manufacturer s website forum for issues with this product previously purchased models failed on or about the same date something about the ghz transceivers messing up i cannot confirm the date because i was inbetween gamming rigs at the time but i tried to use this joystick after getting my new rig fired up and was set back when i encountered the calibration issues there is no fix for this and if you hadn t put in the warranty card then your out your investment go with wired untill the manufacturer takes some responsibility 
i rate this below consumer reports glowing review i purchased this product partially on the recommendation of consumer reports looking back i would have gone further and not bought it the ipod interface is poor at best and the speaker setup via the front menu remote usage is difficul 
ipod dock the joke is on you last christmas we were given the ipod mini as a gift it came with the cable to connect to our computer however the computer had to be turned on to charge the mini thus we sought a stand alone charger for it one would think that a dock for an electronic device would be a place that you could put your device to recharge it however the packaging on the ipod mini dock does not give any information of what is in the box the box itself is much larger than just the dock and the price would lead you to believe that you are getting more than just a piece of plastic and ceramic that helps your mini stand up on your desk heres the joke the dock is absolutely nothing more than a stand for your mini it comes with no cabling and it does not come with an ac adapter that is another apple makes sure that you can t get any idea of what you are buying until after you have purchased it and broken open the packaging at best apple computers has failed to adequately inform the customer of what they are getting or not getting with the ipod dock and at worst the are neck deep in deceptive trade practices people always tell me that apple computers understands their customers maybe they understand them but they also exploit them 
it comes with the forerunner this very expensive cable is already in the package if you purchased the forerunner you won t need this unless you somehow lost it damn it is expensive ! this is a cable for goodness sake 
no speakerphone false advertising for a phone that costs the lack of any features is pretty disturbing but the one that linksys actually points out in their documentation is actually not available on this phone that feature would be a speakerphone a mainstay of about every phone sold today the phone works but the speaker is apparently only to play the startup noise also it feels pretty cheap when using it i was afraid i was going to break a button this one went right back to amazon 
disapointment i m very disapointment about this product i think it look so ugly in my car and doesn t have good sound realmente luce muy feo en mi carro me parece un aparato sin ergonomia y muy mal diseado ademas no suena tan bien se escucha cierta interferencia cuando se le sube el volumenno lo recomiendo estoy decepcionad 
sorry to make the first review a bad one looking for my first mp player thought something small and inexpensive might be where to start so got i this one big mistake the screen was just impossible to read tiny in every way and the included instructions were utterly useless i m not sure what purpose the cd serves because i couldn t get anything from it but warnings about possibly screwing up my laptop if i continued and error messeges i know there are year olds out there who could figure this out easily but i really need something simpler to use and easier to read i am going to return this and try something that is about twice the price 
so so this charger does not seem to charge the batteries fully i thought that my rechargable batteries were out of life but discovered that it was just a case of this charger failing to recharge them fully my daughter brought home a cheap sakar overnight charger when visiting i popped in a set of batteries i thought were done for and found them to be just fine using her sakar charger what happens on my charger is that the lights indicating that the batteries have been fully charged all go off and the batteries are cool to the touch indicating that they have been fully recharged nope ! only about half way recharged 
coby lacks integrity the cd payer is made of what feels like a cheap plastic the cassette adapter was broken after seconds of use so i called coby they said i d have to pay them to send me a replacement ! my advice don t bother buying coby 
i can t believe they call this junk sony i have had this system for monthis now and i am sure this is the worst piece of av equipment i have ever owned sony is usually known for quality products but it this case i am afraid they rested on their laurels and delivered a poorly designed and poorly manufactured piece of equipment to the market the worst part is that i have had numerous problems with it occasionaly it fails to recognize cd dvd inserted after you turn it off and back on on other occasions it completely locks up the first time it happened i had to call sony customer support and find out the secret combination of buttons to press to unlock it now after about months of use it has taken on a habit of completely shutting down with a message protect unplug the only way to bring it back to life is to unplug it and plug it back in after a few minutes there is nothing wrong with my electric wiring i have checked and the system is plugged into a fairly expensive surge protector power conditioner i am not sure whether to go through the trouble of fixing it at this point it s just not worth it because of all the other things i despise about this system first off cds and dvds take forever to load to insert a disk one has to press an eject button and then listen carefully for about two minutes while the system rearranges itself and lets you finally insert the disk if you missed your chance tough luck start all over second it is a royal pain to use any configuration apart from the basic settings is as convoluted as it can possbly be on screen menus a standard on most systems now do not exist and the manual is a joke third the fm radio is awful i went out and spent money on an expensive fm antenna still my cheap clock radio gets better reception fourth there are other annoying little things about this system which are too numerous to list in this review finally i don t share people s opinion that the sound is all that great it s average out ofthebox it is way too heavy on bass the wireless feature is nice i admit and that was the reason i bought it but i would not buy it again or probably another piece of sony equipment in a million years now i could live with wires running around my room or even just a two speaker system rather than deal with this piece of junk shame on sony for slapping their name on this lemon 
mine did not work sony advertised this as a x burner for dvd r media i used the recommended brand verbatim and taiko yuden which are very high end media i was only backing up home movies from my panasonic camcorder the movies are in mpeg format i was only writing data and it should be no problem for any writter unfortunately i got only x write speed with the provided software in a mac as well as in a pc just slower than advertised no clusters it is a noisy drive too i spoke with sony costumer service and i could not get any satisfactory answers i had to wait a long time to be helped they said that the drive was probably damaged i returned it and i do not think the drive quality or the customer support represents the price of this drive 
great sound horrible dvd the sound on this system is really fantastic for the price but i ve had the same experience as the other reviewer the dvd skips constantly and phillips is absolutely no help in fixing the problem amazon has been great and has offered to give a credit but phillips insists that i send at my own expense the machine to them and then wait weeks to have a possibly refurbished unit i m quite disappointed with phillips and its lack of customer service 
disappointing and overpriced this is an overpriced and disappointing product that is third rate at best the user interface is cumbersome and inferior to your average shareware product but this was not the worse of it most disappointing is the detail of map details tokyo for example has virtually no landmarks and one or two roads this for a city of million people this seems to be consistent with other locations in asia even if this product was free and included when the unit was purchased it would be disappointing in other words it s not even worth it if it were free i purchased it in december and it still required a patch to run on windows xp service pack more than a year after it was released consistent with magellan s misguided restriction on not shipping any products except to a few countries i had to have this product shipped to a family member in the usa who in turned shipped it to me clearly the global in gps does not apply to magellan s approach to service and support magellan makes good hardware and should stick to that rather than trying to overcharge for inept software had i known the software support is so poor for magellan products i would have chosen an other gps manufacturer such as garmin 
doesn t work with every vehicle this adapter would not work at all in my ford ranger the vehicle s cassette player kept ejecting it however it did work in a co workers ford ranger it also would not work in a monte carlo same problem 
incompatibility this component was returned because it was not compatible with my dell all inone printer i was not alerted to this possibility by any information from the manufacturer from the supplier or in print on the package i should have been 
works as a usb hub not much else as a powered hub this works well i can t speak to its cooling power because i couldn t get my laptop to sit on it and not move there are only two rubber feet on the top surface at the back so a large laptop will not rest securely on it and will slide all over at the front after trying another cooler that was too small for a large notebook i bought this one specifically because it said it worked with laptops not mine 
not worth it i thought this device would be the answer i was looking for allowing my wife s computer and my laptop to print to the same printer i ve had it for almost a year and as far as printing goes it has never worked from my wife s desktop xpsp and only works sometimes rarely w out a reboot from my laptop xpsp i can only get three ports to show up but it does work just fine with the other devices a memory card reader and a thumb drive tech support has been no help the one or two times i ve actually been able to get them on the phone my advice save your money and buy a network attached storage drive with built in print server 
overpriced ! get the sonnet instead at half the price i don t understand why people spend money on this charger when you can pay half as much for the same thing i bought an ipod charger for my g ipod video from sonnet technologies and i am very satisfied it is small and the connectors retract for easy carrying around search amazon for sonnet usb wall charger for ipod with usb todock cable at about half the price it comes in black or white to go with the color of your ipo 
did not work for me this signal booster did not work for me i set it up according to the instructions connected to a dlink router di when i attempted to connect to the router via laptop it would connect and then drop the connection after about seconds that would repeat indefinitely i tracked the signal with a strength meter and it boosted it to the level expected but for some reason when the connection was made to the router it was dropped i sent the first unit into hawking thinking it was defective but they replaced the unit and it did exactly the same thing i have no idea why it didn t work maybe my fault i am thinking perhaps i need two of these one at the router and one at the laptop perhaps the signal going back to the router is not strong enough to keep the connection 
misrepresented keyboard i am under the impression that i have been swindled microsoft on its packaging and amazon in its web writeup announce this as a remote keyboard for windows xp media center edition i have both a vaio laptop with xp media center edition and a pc with ms media center edition but neither will work with this keyboard the small print inside the box says i have to buy a media center pc equipped with the proper ms receiver for this to connect to absolutely preposterous nowhere outside the box nor in amazon s desciption is there a warning that this severe limitation exists so what do i do with this keyboard now can somebody supply me with a receiver i can connect to my pc or have i really been swindled 
eighteen months and its gone to the dump i bought this dvd player months ago and after rarely using it it has stopped working it will load the dvd but will not read or play anything what more can i say its junk 
hard to use user instructions are not easy to read i bought this to replace an older sharp organizer i liked the old one a lot but the lines of resoluations were starting to disappear so i order another sharp the style is different from my old one this one has a stylus the new one is hard to use the display is hard to read and the user instructions tend to leave out some major details which case some frustrations with trying to set up the organizer i had to call sharp and they even told me some of the insturction manuals for this model wereincomplete i will keep it only because i need something to put all my phone numbers into but i don t see this becoming something i will use everyday 
dlync video phone setting this unit up has been impossible and i have not been able to use it i have sought help of dlync website dlynk phone support the have not been able to work me through it i have paid for a machine i cannot use have spent countless hours on phone and computer in trying to set it up another person who has the same system with which i wanted to communicate has had the same problem and cannot use hers 
low life at the same time that i purchased the axion axna portable dvd player for my kids i also purchased the phillips pet portable dvd player for myself the phillips is in a different league than the axion and if you re a traveler that will rely on the battery life of the portable dvd player then you definitely don t want the axion the phillips is a bit more expensive but it has everything and more than you could want out of a portable dvd player both the phillips and the axion lcd screens are crystal clear you lose a little definition as you move side to side as with most lcd type screens but nothing too drastic that would warrant a complaint the phillips pet has an screen and the axion a screen the difference is not dramatically different but the larger phillips screen does enhance the viewing experience the sound is fair on both the phillips and the axion without headphones but i don t think that the idea was to use the units without them sound is fabulous on the phillips with a good pair of headphones and just okay on the axion your ipod headphones will do just fine for either unit and if you don t have a pair you ll need to buy one because the players don t come with any both have two audio output jacks and a way splitter not included worked fine on both so that people could watch and listen at the same time with headphones heres the big difference between the two units battery life ive gotten almost hours out of the phillips battery and the axion s battery gives you less than hours therefore if you re an airline traveler or just want to bring your player somewhere that you can t use either the car adapter or the dc adapter then you absolutely don t want the axion you want the phillips on a recent airline trip the axion after a full charge conked out after less than two hours thats not even a full movie in most cases the phillips battery is a bit bulky you d think that with today s technology they d be able to slim it down but you can t complain about the hours of life you get with it after a full charge the axion s battery is smaller and more lightweight than the phillips but what can you do other than watch a few spongebob episodes with less than two hours of battery life the phillips pet is good for at least full length features before charging and that s awesome for long trips where you can t use the dc adapter or car adapter the car adapter on both the axion and the phillips work great and they both have long cords so no need for the battery on car trips the axion at best might be a nice less expensive alternative if you won t be taking your portable dvd player to places that require battery use both the phillips and the axion fit in my small briefcase and they re both relatively light the axion is a feather compared to the phillips amazon sells cases for the units that can mount on the back of the driver or passenger seats the case i got also mounts in between the driver and passenger seats i d highly recommend a case for your player i went with the case logic koskin dvd player case all in all the phillips pet was a much more satisfying purchase for me for my purposes the axion just won t do for airline trips and that s a major requirement hence the axion is a major disappointment but as i said earlier the axion is certainly a viable alternative if you don t mind sacrificing screen size and you don t plan on the need for battery power choose your view 
buyer beware i wanted to like this product i really wanted to like this product but i am severely disappointed when i purchased the iaudio this past summer i quickly learned that my unit had problems when i moved an mp file onto the player about of the time there would be these weird skips and electronic noise associated with it sometimes deleting and reinstalling the file helped often it didn tso i contacted their customer service and updated the firmware as instructed the problem was still there so i returned it to cowon and they insisted that the player was fine i sincerely doubt that random electronic noise is a feature but once they say that there isn t a problem i don t know what else to do so they sent it back to me i ve tried it out again and the problems remain on a lark tonight i looked them up on the better business bureau website their rating is an f go figure i would not recommend this product 
no battery back up we bought this clock radio got it home set it up realized that it didn t have battery back up called sony only to find out that they do not find it necessary to put that feature on their alarm clocks how bizarre they do not carry battery back up on any of their new models according to their representative at the customer service center ! boxed it up and it s going right back where it came from if it s okay not to have battery back up it might deserve a chance however what s the use in having an alarm clock if you can t trust that it will indeed wake you up

quick shippment user unfriendly lost reception from time to time i don t recommend this produc 
reminds me of a quarter horse race great performance but only for a short time don t get me wrong i loved this dvd player when it worked it had great features crisp picture and good control over the search and pause features yeah there were some downsides to it that have already been mentioned through other reviews for example when listening to music or other media it only shows things like directory root file and folder numbers makes it hard to browse but i found this to be of little inconvenience the main problem was that it broke within a year now i m not unrealistic i know that electronics wear out but i also know that most last much longer that this i m not expecting it to last as long as my vcr a jcpenny s brand we got during the sbut one year what a rip off just as others posters mentioned i got the infamous h error message and then nothing didn t even bother calling the company since the warranty was only days i already knew what i was going to be told my advice keep looking with this many similar reviews there must be a design flaw with this model somewhere and it s not gonna get fixed by a company whose only concern is the bottom line do some research cause when it comes to pricey electronics you wanna hold out for a thoroughbred 
i never recieved it i dont know if i like it because i never recieved i 
junk bought this cd player worked a couple of times over the last couple of months now doesn t work cheap junk if you only want a radio it tunes o k the day warranty is a sham they know it will last days

horrible support but a good unit i bought this unit for my wife and we received it this week it works great when i registered the unit on line i found that magellan s website showed there were software updates for this unit roadmate i downloaded the update and after some difficulty i was able to perform the upgrade i then found that the voice prompts no longer worked i logged back onto their webpage and found that the firmware upgrade had been removed due to a technical issue they are working on to correct i verified all of my settings and finally called magellan support the support group was hard to understand they are located in india and were unable to help me i asked if this was a problem related to the upgrade since the voice prompts worked fine before the upgrade and they would not say they asked that i upgrade the unit again although the screen showing the firmware and os versions showed the new version numbers but by this time i was low on battery charge and could not perform the upgrade this unit did not ship with an a c adapter i asked if there was a way to backout the upgrade and he tom informed me there was not i asked the tech again if this was a known issue and what other issues i might experience with this upgrade and after some time on hold he once again was evasive and would not answer my questions i asked for a supervisor and after some more time on hold he told me one would call me back within hours i was not happy with this and said that was unacceptable to which he put me on hold some more after i told him i thought to hours is more along my expectations he came back and said a supervisor would call me back in an hour it is well over an hour and no call so far i tried their corp office and was routed by an aru back to india i called their corp office again and after attempting the dial by name directory got to a receptionist named marti who would not connect me to management she said she would send me to quality assurance and they could escalate to management if necessary i spent about minutes on hold and was finally disconnected i love the magellan gps units and i have three blazer explorist and the roadmate and each time i have had to call tech support i am very disappointed i have to say i will not recommend their products to anyone else since i am really getting the impression they are disconnected with their client base and provide at least some answers to be fair tom tech support did say the updated firmware will be out within a weeks time however until then i have a nice map on a video device with no audible prompts whatsoever if my wife was not already used to the unit i would pay bucks more and get something by another manufacturer in summary be careful with firmware upgrades and don t expect good customer service if you need magellan s help 
doesn t work well with xp if you thought the windows install and performance were bad wait until you try it under xp i should have spent the extra dollars and gotten a decent card 
annoying and frustrating not what i expected from hp i started my own business and purchased this item because of my past experiences with hp laser jets one year later i m about to throw it out the window and buy a new printer why first of all even when printing in black and white the device uses color ink approximately of my printing is black and white yet the color ink cartridge levels are consistently depleted as a result i have to purchase what a surprise hp color inks even though i don t ever use them i estimate that s cost me about over the last year the second reason i despise this machine relates to its annoying warning message pop up boxes when ink is running low in any cartridge a pop up appears they cannot be disabled they appear until the ink cartridge is completely empty since the machine depletes color inks at such minute levels these messages can appear for days or until you replace it with another expensive hp ink cartridge lastly the machine will not operate if any of the ink cartridges are empty i can t tell you how many times i ve wanted to print a simple black and white document but could not because the machine was out of pink or yellow ink clearly hp has decided that the best way to make money is through ink sales if they d focused more on the customer s ultimate experience they d have secured me as a repeat long term customer 
missing travel kit i cannot review this item since i have not received it so far at the shipping address i gave amazon when i did the purchase i bought four items and i only got two of them by mail what happened to the other two items apple ipod usb travel kit with car charger travel adapter cable purchased on koss stereo in ear ear plugs the spark plug purchased on who knows 
i hate this palm i have been using a palm for the past years and this is by far the worst it is constantly crashing i had to get rid of all my fun custom programs which is why i used to love the palm so much the touchscreen is slow ! im guessing because of the flash memory it is hard to really get good use out of it even the most trivial things are wrong with this palm like there is no power light this means you can t tell whether or not it is charging i m so angry about that it often takes several nights of me plugging it in thinking it is charging all night only to wake up and realize that the cable mind you they got rid of the cradle was loose it is a good thing that it uses flash memory because i have drained the battery several times with this circus act i don t like the new big size it doesn t fit into my old reliable case which i had for years and was very secure i like to clip the palm to my belt this thing is so big that it is constantly hitting my leg when i sit down and falling off so i keep it in my bag now and don t use it nearly as much as i used to i loved the old palms so much they were quick adaptable portable and decently reliable but this thing is a clunking pain in the butt i am really ready to at least investigate the pocket pc s 
great switch for the price this switch works really well i use it between a windows xp and windows operating systems when switching to windows control to the mouse and keyboard is switched nearly instantly however when switching to the xp os control time varies from nearly instantly to or seconds i also like the fact that it controls both the mouse and keyboard with one usb port on the pc it frees up a port using the numlock key on the keyboard is the hot key to switch it also has buttons on the device itself to select which pc to control i rate this product stars when i posted the first time i thought i put stars but i must have accidentally selected i recommend this switch to anyone who wants a good product at a low price 
beware of mail in rebate hoax the card works as advertised but sandisk does not send in mail inrebate even though i mailed it in with the upc barcode sandisk sent me a post card stating that i needed to resubmit it with the barcode how can i resubmit when they already have the barcode in my experience with sandisk i got rebate back on one of two cards that i submitted so you get mail in rebate of the time with sandisk i think mail inrebate is a big hoax perpetrated by these companies don t trust it ! 
does not work correctly with windows media center in vista the picture quality with this card is great it does a very good job encoding analog cable tv however with windows media center in vista the card cannot be configured for both analog cable and ota hdtv supposedly a microsoft hotfix should resolve this issue but it didn t work for me a hauppage wintv hvr works fine for both analog cable and ota hdtv but it s analog picture quality is not as good 
card didn t work poor customer service i bought this card and the belkin pre n wireless router in nov at a bestbuy store during thanksgiving sale the router worked but the card did not i called belkin many times everytime they asked me to re install the drivers and software for the card but the card never worked i wasted more than hours on phone and re installing drivers again and again then finally belkin asked me to ship them the defective card to get a replacement i pointed out that i should not have to bear the shipping costs because the card never worked to begin with but belkin was not ready to cover the shipping costs i have shipped them the defective card today and am awaiting a replacement to arrive 
not a good buy i bought this item despite the bad reviews it had gotten because i absolutely adored the styling when it arrived i unboxed it and checked everything clock worked great radio was so so but not a big deal and the cd had good quality sound for the price though i found setting the clock and preset stations a bit complicated for my tastes overall i was still pleased the next week the radio quit working still no big deal since i bought it more for the cd and alarm clock the week after that the alarm quit working then this week the cd quit as well i can t even get it to power on of course by this time i had long ago discarded the box so returning it was out of the question what i am left with is perfectly functional clock that keeps great time but nothing else save your money and don t get sucked in by the design the way i did they clearly need to make some major improvements on the function before i will ever buy another one of these ! 
worked like a charm for hours install went smooth on my wk dell inspiron notebook everything worked fine for hours then it just stopped worked with customer support for about an hour getting nowhere this thing is junk i m sending it back 
ouch ! whose brainchild was this it has no use ever being made or produced the a cartridge gives you about pages of print the x gives you about page of print for only about dollars more in price the a costs about cents per page printed the x costs about cents per page printed why would anyone buy the a cartridge and pay almost x as much per page of print where i work i made sure our supply folks order only the x cartridges 
too fragile i am shopping now to replace this having had success with other linksys products i stuck with this brand when i needed a usb network adaptor the hinged door into which the network cable fits broke not long after purchase rendering this product useless 
once you put it on you better leave it there to echo one of the other reviewers exact placement of the wrist rest is near impossible two days after i thought i had done it perfectly a bubble appeared i tried pressing it out but within a matter of hours the bubble back so i decided to remove the wrist rest to my disgust the adhesive had in the space of a few days begin to cling tighter to my laptop than the pad it took me about hour to get the last of the gummy adhesive off avoid the wrist rest 
photo is of wrong item this is not an xd to compactflash card adapter if you order this item number you will receive a pc card adapter that accepts xd picture cards and smartmedia cards and fits your pcmia slot on a pc or mac it is not for a camera or substitute for a compactflash card there is nothing compact flash about it the product you will recieved does not look like the photo on amazon s website 
did not work first time i received the unit on time but after one day the volume did not work anymore have to return the unit for replacement 
don t buy me i suggest never buying an adesso product the product i bought new came used not with all of the pieces and then afterwords they wouldn t even let me return it want to try talking to a customer service rep go ahead and try calling any one of their business numbers because not one of them is going to be answered 
garbage pure and simple i bought this player because i wanted to play dvds from various regions the good news is that it plays discs from all regions outside of region just as well as it plays those in region the bad news is that i never found a disc which the unit could play through in its entirety it would click grind and sputter along for or on a good day minutes before just freezing up save your money or buy a coby dvd which is an infinitely superior unit 
don t buy this this mouse works fine on my laptop however it goes through a pack of batteries within weeks i hate it if i still had the packaging for this mouse i would have returned it no wonder it is so cheap 
okay product terrible instructions but it does work on a mac it took about hours of work to make it function with a macbook running os x and an epson cx and i needed a windows xp pc to set it up but yes it works for mac installation the trick is that using the windows xp pc connected with wire not wirelessly you need to change the static ip of the server to a dhcp given by your router and then you have to go trial an error with your browser to find whatever address it was assigned on the mac set it up as an lpd printer also make sure you type the queue name exactly as it is shown on the status screen and god help you if you don t have one of the printers listed on the packaging 
a waste of money i bought this as a replacement for a slightly older microsoft wireless keyboard that was stolen the other board mouse used bluetooth and was great this one uses a different system with a long cord reciever unit as opposed to a small plug in usb my main complaint is that it frequently drops a letter or number here and there this would not be a big problem if you are writing a letter to your aunt margie but if you are entering financial data it is a very big deal varying the distance from the reciever to the board makes no difference ditto with fresh batteries even duracells there are plenty of other good board out there so do not waste your time on this one 
cheap and loud looks really good on the shelf but it s all show if you like need modular the connections are convenient but the cables are low quality i purchased a much better unit manufactured by hiper the connectors and cables are much better if you don t need modular coolermaster is also much better quality i m not just splitting hairs here this unit does not compare to others in the same price range 
omx a big disappointment i have used shure sony ultimate ears etc over the years and these are properly one of the worst fitting ear buds i have ever used no matter how i tried i just can t get them to fit right let alone use them for when i work out i am a big sennheiser fan but this was a big disappointment 
doesn t work tech support not good manual not good i just received this unit yesterday to serve as a bridge to my belkin wireless router the router manual specifies this ap cannot get it to talk wirelessly to the belkin router i ve spent a good deal of time with it including minutes with belkin tech support which consisted of someone reading a script to me arguing about trivial things and then ringing off before the issue was resolved frustrating to say the least i m also not impressed with the lack of logging as well as the wide open browser access your ssid and security settings are displayed to anyone without logging in the manual is sadly out of date and does not match the firmware nor the physical product which would make setup difficult for an inexperienced user belkin would like to have us believe that this is a plug and play product but this is not the case generally this is pretty much a piece of cr p i m tring to get belkin to rma it and either replace it or refund overall i m more impressed with linksys cisco products than belkin even in this price range 
frustrating way to watch video i had been using a hauppauge mediamvp digital media receiver model and quite happy with this device i was able to play my recorded videos and show my vacation photos on a large screen but it died mysteriously and i thought i would upgrade to this more capable or so i thought device i had lots of problems getting it working correctly and used it with different media servers both the one that came with the device and the windows media server worked for me i use the device primarily to watch shows i time shift from cable there are two features that make this device far inferior to my previous device the fast forward is fast in name only perhaps it doubles the speed but it does not seem that quick to me and i spend a lot of time watching stupid ads in addition to ff the hauppauge had a feature that would skip or seconds at a time that made missing commercials a breeze there is a jump feature but that lets you enter the total time into the clip you want to be so if it actually worked it froze the device each time i tried to use it and i had to unplug it to even get the thing turned off it would be a pain to use when i had watched part of a video the hauppauge remembered where i had stopped and offered to restart from that position image my frustration when i clicked the wrong green key sending me to the video menu about hours into a movie to get back to where i was i had to slow forward for an hour to get to see the end of the movie who ever designed the software that the remote uses should be well i will leave it to your imagination so after mucking with this for to long it is going back to amazon and i am going to buy another hauppauge 
good scanner horrible noise my boss wanted to buy an inexpensive scanner for our office and this little canon works great the canoscan software is quick easy to use and is the same software used on almost the entire canon line scanning documents in b w take less than seconds on default dpi settings which is pretty good for a budget scanner the one thing i can t stand is the horrible screeching noise the scanner makes when documents are being scanned it s so bad that i have to plug my ears while using it how can i describe it it s not a loud noise it s not a noise that will cause permanent damage but it is a screech that gives you that scratching chalkboard effect the first few times i used it no big deal however the first time i had to manually feed or pages in a row i had enough i think the scanner is so thin and compact it just doesn t have the housing or the insulation to muffle the noise maybe my ears are too sensitive and i can hear dog whistles too but it s really bloody annoying i might just have to splurge on a quieter scanner before i go crazy i ll ask my boss to reimburse me hes great like that like i said love the scanner hate the noise 
not good this is the worst thing never buy this one there is serious noise big problem 
doesn t stay tuned i was so disappointed in the fact that the guitar didn t come with any picks or a strap i didn t realize it when ordering or i would have ordered that too my son had trouble holding it without the strap when i finally got around to buying those items i showed the guitar to my brother who has been playing for years and he said it didn t stay tuned once you play a chord it goes out of tune i m not thrilled to say the least 
d link dwlgap range extender the product never worked even after three calls to tech help tech help even changed my computer settings and it took me a while to reconfigure it i returned the product and advise anyone not to purchase it 
be careful i have had three of these drives fail in the past six months two were on a mac g one was on a linux system on a positive note western digital has a very efficient replacement policy if you are still shopping i would strongly recommend spending a little more and buying an enterprise class drive if you have already purchased this drive you should stop what you doing and back up your data 
great idea poorly executed i bought this with the hopes of consolidating backing up files for home and work pcs i already had the drives so this seemed like a good idea it took about hours to configure the device the way i wanted to a mb mirror and a mb non mirror the mirrored partitions seem to have real problems the speed reading writing to the mirror are very slow and the mirror partition keeps getting corrupted to fix the problem requires that you download and use a command line application i am technically capable but i really don t like having to fix the mirror partition whenever i want to use it i have one pc that can t even run the application to attach the drives it crashes when i open it also mentioned in previous posts it is annoying to have to load each pc with software to attach to the device the fact that it doesn t use ntfs or cli format is another really annoyance i have to copy these drives to another ntfs drive in order to recapture the files i have on this device windows linux and mac can t read the format of these drives summation i would not buy this again i am now looking at the linksys product it would require me to buy two hd enclosures but at least then i could actually use it 
super streaky after some use of my new notebook sony vaio fep i started collecting dust and fingerprints on the display i purchased the monitor wipes to clear the display i was foolish enough to trust the packaging ! i expected the product to be streak free i tried wiping my monitor with the product and it quickly dried and left horrible visible streaks i discarded the first wipe and tried again with the second one it also left streaks i tried wiping vertically instead of horizonatally it left streaks i tried wiping in circles it left streaks i tried inquiring about my problem by visiting the manufacturer s web page my inital thought was that perhaps i had received a bad batch of product i filled out a form and never received a response my new thought is that i ve been cheated ultimately i purchased a m microfiber cloth and some cleaning solution that did clear up the streaks left by the monitor wipes 
did not work unfortunately i never got to use it as the ipod would not charge looked very cute but never got to use it returning for a refund 
what a waste of money i was unfortunate enough to get one of these things for a gift since it was a gift i was stuck with it even though it had numerous problems buy something else and save your money this thing is junk 
better not to buy i m the consumer of sandisk usb flash drives i have used couple of sandisk flash drives ie mb mini mb mini before i bought this product performance wise this particular product is not doing good it s taking long time to copy files from my computers even it s taking long time to delete files from this disk so i returned to amazon and looking for mini products from sandisk i doubt all the micro products which is having capacity more than mb now i m planning to buy mb or gb sandisk mini usb flash drive better buy some good one than wasting your time on this product 
promising prototype poor finished product for me the main drawback of this unit as a clock radio lies in the primitive interaction between the radio and clock it is basically a clock attached to a one way time switch the radio has to be switched off by hand and the alarm set to go each night unlike a wall time switch but just like the traditional alarm clock you can t reset the alarm when turning the radio off in the morning because there is no am pm distinction this might all be fine if you have never had a clock radio before but for the last years or so the canonical design that works very well has been automatic switch on every morning with usually an hour or so of run time before automatic switch off set and forget the clock itself is rather small poorly lit and difficult to tell the time from when half asleepi found the sound quality unremarkable for current table radios higher frequencies rolled off a bit too quickly and bass tended toward boxiness perhaps because of the bass port being tuned in an attempt to reach too low frequencies for the driver and cabinet combination in side byside comparison with the boston acoustics recepter the latter had greater clarity and presence and a more pleasing bass though suffered slightly from bass boominess doubtless also from pushing the bass port tuning a bit far for functionality as a clock radio it wins hands down and the tivoli i m afraid has to go back 
beware re bate not honored i knew the cash back offer sounded too good to be true and sure enough they rejected my upcs i kept copies only have hounding them and contacting the better business bureau did they say whoops a mistake i have a fleeting suspicion this was intentional 
what happened to the hard case im so dissappointed in caselogic for discontinuing the hard cases they were great a hard cover with rubberized coating and actual cd case style holders inside that you pop out with your finger by pressing the center somebody could have sat on it and it would ve been fine 
horrible i have used hp tdk fujifilm and jvc blank dvd s and have had no problems but when i tried these sony dvd s all i got were problems they suck a lot of other people seem to say that these are good but for me i m using an hp lightscribe dvd burner and these dvd s suck they do not work don t waste your money on these if i could give this product stars i would 
keep hitting the side buttons i was looking for a button mouse to replace my old one its fine as a mouse but the buttons on either side are way too easy to hit accidentally if you cup the mouse sort of like you are holding a baseball you wont hit those buttons but who uses a mouse like that most folks sort of reach for the mouse and put their hand on top of the mouse and that s where you start hitting the side buttons my old mouse put the buttons closer to the fron 
great idea terribe product this is my first review and i am writing it because i am compelled to let others know that this is not a good product i spent at least hours trying to configure the device and at least one of those hours was spent on the phone with linksys i have experience with networking and quite simply this device does not work as intended i was able to get it to work for periods of time but it stops after minutes or so or i have to reconnect don t waist your time or money on this 
run run forrest run fast take it from me is not functional if you are reading this then you are gump y and you and i must be family first i love amazon they are the consistent type of e merchant and that s good ! but but but but why would a designated by me upper echelon merchant like amazon carry this sandisk gb compact flash card type i sdcfb it simply is not functional information that i stored sandisk gb compact flash card type i sdcfb is gone or not readable i am surprised that amazon did not catch onup with the problem the product won t retain any info then i had to store less and less information on the card so that my info is able to stay on the card another hours i decided to contact amazon they were very shortly and cordially sent me a replacement sandisk gb compact flash card type i sdcfb with the paperwork for returning the original sandisk gb compact flash card type i sdcfbthen i got something that a did have the shape of a gig sandisk cf card b did have the sandisk label that says sandisk gb compact flash card type i sdcfbc and did have the original shiny factory sandisk package none being the less different computers later and hour had passed couldn t recognize what is inserted into the cf reader d the brand new replacement card i got with the original factory wrapping that s brand new and untouched and unrecognized by computers one may safely assume pardon the facetiousness sandisk gb compact flash card type i sdcfb is yet to be recognized from amazon twice in the mail i got a sandisk gb compact which flash card type i sdcfb both cards i received had a problem and therefore it is safe to assume that sandisk gb compact flash card type i sdcfb production have a major glitch i mean the memory card cannot be used for memory purposes i have to yet see what or for what other than memory can i utilize a memory card i beg your pardon but in essence i am trying to imply that the sandisk products were a joke ! being the consistent e merchant that amazon always been amazon agreed to return them this was not a surprise coming from amazon in essence i strongly urge any person that makes a living and tries to have some fun with their hard earned living to not be fooled if you see sandisk run away as fast as possible you ll lose it all in a matter of a day or so sandisk gb compact flash card type i sdcfb is not compatible with data storage ! or even short transfers of data from a home computer to work spend the extra on an alternative brand that s the only way you ll get a cf card that is correctly labeled and serve intended functions i strongly recommend as well as urge individual who is thinking of getting that other brand of giga cards to make sure do so use amazon only and don t be fooled by any other e merchant who s not as high of an echelon as amazon amazon had it not been for amazon i would have lost all i paid god bless amazon for their extreme timely tentativeness i also pray for sandisk so that god renders it with the power to accomplish the purpose they stick onto their product line god bless and keep on shopping 
pretty desappointed we bought this phone in order to make receive calls with yahoo voice using phone out and phone in but apart from its nice design this phone didn t meet our expectations mainly because of its unability to transfer contact data from your yahoo adress book and entering contacts in the phone or simply navigate into the menus wasn t the best part however this phone seems to be a better performer for pc to pc calls yahoo msgr directly since you can directly access your messenger contact list 
not as advertised i was excited to try this product for my directv dvr connection without having to install another phone jack simply put it didn t work then when i tried to use it for a regular phone both cordless and corded there was so much static that you couldn t have a conversation i was very disappointed it appeared for me this product was too good to be true 
danelectro fab metal pedal the overall construction of the pedal is pretty sturdy aside from the fact that most of it is made of plastic the sound it produces ranges from a hard overdrive to the hariest shreding distortion the pedal deminishes tone quite a bit and doesn t have a very good range very high notes are not processed correctly and deliver poor results not bad for the money but not an investment in the least bit i just got this because i had a gift certificate that i wanted to get rid of otherwise i would not have purchased the item 
doesn t support explorist gps units this software does not support the explorist series from magellan for that you need magellan directroute v which is part number amazon doesn t currently carry that version if you have an explorist do not buy this go elsewhere and get the correct version if you have an older magellan gps this should work just fine 
it s a great item only problem is that it is only worth which is the true list price 
hates sleeping computers this switch works pretty well until one of your computers goes to sleep or the display sleeps then you have to power cycle the switch to get it to display anything after waking up the computer or display same problem occurs when you just turn on the computer windows is especially bad about thinking it has no display if you boot windows when it is not the selected computer if your computer never sleeps and never sleeps the display then the switch works fine otherwise look for something else 
confortable but the sound is poor i don t recommend you to buy this item its sound is poor and there is a static noise when the car engine is on 
save your money seldom do i write a review downgrading a product but this one is truly the exception i bought this one on ebay and thought i was getting a good deal price wise it was great however it would appear that the designer of this organizer tried to put so many features into it that it ends up doing nothing well the directions are terrible they are extremely difficult to follow i never could get it to sync with outlook i fear that today i will waste more time trying to get it to work i owned one of the first palm pilots and it was child s play in comparison in this case you get what you pay for don t purchase this you ll be sorry take care it s a time bandit and even if it were to function flawlessly the design with all of its attempted functions is way too much punch this button to get to this screen which will take you to the next screen ad nauseum do you carry the manual with you put together in another country and probably by someone not entirely familiar with the english language truly disappointed with this worthless plastic 
terrible belkin i bought this adapter from the local bestbuy store and found that it was malfunctioning there as no power light coming on the adapter after hrs and phone calls to the belkin customer service i found this out then i went to the store and got a new one this had the light but the drivers provided for install were not right the belkin technical support is nothing sort of cheats and idiots request to be transferred to the level support and they will cut you off i wasted like days and phone calls and ulktimately am back to square one trying to get a new adapter never buy belkin again

a real lemon returned the product i used the frp for a couple of days before returning it i had to reboot the router every day to re gain connectivity to the internet additionally if i disconnected my ethernet cable on any of my pcs the print server app would continually try to connected search for the printer server causing the pc to bog down and be really slow do not buy one of these the d link di p is far superior 
horrible design thank goodness for apple they made a product designed well enough to get you just past a year year warrenty and then die i would hate for them to have to replace all these horribly designed dollar ipods

no tuner included this product does not have its own tuner which is not mentioned on sony s webpage nor in any specifications of the product it is revealed unhappily after purchase if one has a surround system this product is incompatible trying to get sony representatives to confirm this disadvantage was enormously frustrating 
worst item ever i recently bought this card to add on to my hp desktop computer the card went in easy enough but that s when the problems started i put in the disk that came with the card but over and over my computer wouldn t recognize the card or the program on the disk i kept having problems occur one after another and other programs starting to fail due to this mess after almost losing the computer on the second occasion i was forced to take the card out of the computer all problems ended immediately ! i ve had no problems with belkin s cords and wires but their cards and hubs i ve had nothing but trouble do yourselves a favor and don t get this item it could cause you nothing but your entire computer to crash it s not worth your hard earned money to see your computer crash and burn is it if you need to add a card find yourselves a different brand i myself am going to try adaptec hopefully that one won t cause me the problems that i have gotten with this one 
don t buy this if you have yamaha keyboard this item will not work if you have a yamaha keyboard the people at the company were very nice to deal with but their product just won t work with a yamaha keyboard there was a constant low humming noise that showed up at a low note on the music notation software i us 
awkward data entry well technically it does everything it says it does but data entry is awkward having to toggle between the calculator screen for numbers and the alpha screen for letters and then going to a whole other screen for symbols for the reminder section i can not turn off the alarm for my entry s takes me an average of times to input any one entry pedometer is great but the clip of the case isn t great and keeps unhooking from my belt plus it counts normal movement such as lifting the unit as a step so not entirely accurate overall this takes so long to use it was a waste of my money and i find myself reverting to the post it method of remembering things 
don t buy this after only months the sandisk cruzer micro gb died data was lost could not be read both my desktop and laptop computer wanted to reformat the cruzer but when i tried to format it could not flash drive is totally useless i replaced it with a kingston data traveller and i hope it lasts longer 
i thought it would be good this charger first started out awesome and had no problems then after about months it started to act up and now it wont charge my ipod at all find a better charger or you will be buying multiple chargers 
static producer the use of this ac power adaptor has increased the amount of static to the point where using the radio with the adaptor is pointless on battery the radio works very well just attach the adaptor and all reception is lost invest in batteries rather than this product 
lexmark no ink cart after clicking click order i found out that this cartridge was not shipped from amazon i was going to order both black and color i immediatly e mailed the shipper to cancel the order inside hour i received a e mail in return that the item was already scanned and could not be canceled i kept the ink cartridge and went to staples and bought the black cart the same color cart was available at a cheaper price less than amazon s private vendor i probably will not use click shopping again 
it s what you pay for i purchased this anticipating using it with my mp recorder as well as my camcorder ordering and shipping was great through amazon when i received it i tested it with my mp recorder my test subject was the television about feet from me playing at a normal listening level my first test i got very little sound so i adjusted the input level of the recorder to it s highest level the resulting level was enough to hear since i was planning to be able to record lectures at times the distance of my test i knew that this mic alone would not handle the task yesterday i tried it out recording the children s christmas pagent at church the difference in sound over my camcorder s builtin mics was amazing though there was a low level hiss however there were two things that made me decide to return it the first was that there seems to be little or no accoustic isolation of the mic elements and the microphone body it picked up the slightest touch of the camcorder and even normal touch on the tripod it even picked up the motor noise that the internal mic does not the second is that it is highly susceptible to electrical interference with the mic off i got a radio station and when i touched the mic i heard a buzz i removed the mic from the supplied cable and even the noise i got touching the connector end wasn t nearly as loud i really expected more from audio technica even for a mic at this price 
amazon sent the wrong product amazon sent me the f not flat crt tv they would not honor the price they advertised for the df i didn t want what they sent me 
piece of junk this sucker couldn t pick up a single channel not even one less than miles away i live in a fairly open area 
it doesn t work at all i connected all the cables as instructed but it doesn t work the light is not on so i return it to amazon 
it works for a while although the software interface wasn t the most sophisticated the wg was easy to install and worked well enough for about six months then it started dropping connections to the various networks i d been using and now it doesn t connect at all i ve done quite a bit of troubleshooting apparently it s fairly common for the wg to crap out after several months don t buy it 
look elsewhere like other reviewers i ve had units as a result of warranty returns the units work for a while and then the bluetooth begins to fail to connect on power up if you have multiple bluetooth receivers it will fail with all of them the built in diagnostic light for bluetooth is simply inaccurate 
okay if you don t want it to be a portable my mom bought this particular portable player for my son because we were going to be on some long flights and she thought he d handle it better if he could watch a few dvds the picture and audio quality aren t that great but not bad for the price the only problem is that we can not get the rechargeable battery to charge therefore it is useless for the purpose it was bought for it still places if plugged into an electrical outlet but there is no way to take it on the plane i have not been able to find a replacement battery but am assuming it might be less expensive to buy a whole new dvd player 
gb what are they talking about i started adding files to this card to use in my phone but it has never shown more than gb capacity even though it is printed gb on the face i have contacted sandisk just earlier tonight to find out what is up with this card so far i am more confused than pleased 
known software bug may bite you while it looks like a great toy this never installed on my xp home system after hours with logictech support that is phone time not the many hours of waiting time and many attempts at setting privledges in the registry it still never installed logitech blames microsoft and it may well be true but they should have a manual way of starting services instead of relying on automation i am very disappointed that i never got a chance to even try the pen if you do take the chance on it be prepared to ship it back because it may never even install on your system 
i will never buy one agian i have had nothing but problems out of mine first off the screen went out due to a factory defect only months after buying got it fixed and went out agian i just took the piece of junk nad threw it away i wouldnt waist my time with it 
i bought and had the same problem i had the same problem as sergey except that the connection would work for a few minutes and then would shut itself off very poor product compared to the wrtgs with the high gain antenna thats what i m going back to don t waste your time or money on this surprisingly crappy product strange because linksys products are usually pretty good 
no workie unit apparently does not work with older magnavox vhs wasted my money 
won t work on the zire what a waste of money ! yes it will load it has great graphics but you can t control the games instructions are almost worthless they are written as if you are using a joy stick 
that s why i hate apple never seen a worse less intuitive inconvenient to use and worsely documented software that itunes apples is up to it s usual standard that s precisely why i prefer not to mess with it 
will not work with sportrak color don t know how this could work with on sportrak and not another but it will definately not work with the sportrak color the back of the unit is smaller than the meridan series and is too small to lock into place and even if it were large enough the locking mechanism won t match 
very bad product none of the port in this usb is working properly whenever i connect a thumb drive the system hangs and it will lead to restart the system don t ever go for this product 
no way power while the specs above say way power supply offers plug in power with selected sony or aiwa portable recorders battery power for use with all other recordersthis is not true there is no battery unit shipped with this device you can see it in the instructions but it isn t in the package so unless you are using it with a selected sony or aiwa device don t buy this it won t work btw i am a slow learner when i bought the first one of these i thought it was defective because it didn t have the battery pack i returned it and got another one which was absolutely unopened guess what ! there is no battery pack in the blisterpack 
not good maybe you can make this thing work for your particular application but it was pitiful for what i was trying to do first off let me point out one thing if you re planning on using the little rf wires that hang in front of the infrared recievers on the front of your components bear this in mind when you stick those units in place they block the receiver on the component from being able to receive an infrared signal when they are in place you can only tell your components what you want them to do thru the rf signal that means you can t use the existing remote for any of your components which of course means you have to trust that you ll be able to program every single function of those remotes into this unit i happen to have directtv with tivo as well as a fairly complicated denon a v unit i cannot imagine trying to use this universal remote to control everything that the original remotes did and even if i thought the universal could do it i wouldn t want to try to relearn all those functions on a new remote i m used to the layout of the directtv unit and i m not about to start over again that being said you can still use the rf functionality without the hard wired rf transmitters the mrf will also receive the signal from the remote and transmit it wirelessly to your components the problem is you have to position the mrf right in front of the components a few feet away not real convenient unless you want the thing sitting in the middle of your living room if all your components are in a cabinet or something and the mrf is in there with them that may work better but if not you re out of luck now all that aside the remote will still not transmit to the mrf with any kind of consistency it also will barely transmit thru walls or any other solid objects all i wanted was something to control volume and maybe channels from various locations around the house and on the back porch without rendering my other remotes useless and or requiring me to place the mrf in a ridiculous location there was no chance of getting what i was after nice idea but no dice 
swiss gear rolling computer case the bag is self was very nice compartmentalized beautifully the problem was the telescoping arm would not stay in the open position kept closing up by itself plus the length of the arm handle was not long enough for a person i returned this bag and found another swiss gear style with handle arm that works perfeclty 
they re useless iv tried these earbuds multiple times hoping they d work everytime i put them in my ears they fall out theyre useless waste of my money 
gross the silicone is sticky so if you plan to put your ipod in your pocket or your bag plan to have lint all over it i never used it because it looked awful immediately not worth all that you ll pay in shipping 
awkward shape avoid it the shape conforms perfectly to the designer s hands but unless you share the same dna i d avoid this product i ve used many of these over the years and this is the only one i struggled with constantly shifting it to get it s high and low points in a place that was tolerable i finally reversed it pointing it towards me and it worked a little better this just needs to be a simple pad instead they ve overdesigned it as a gimmick 
these tape cassettes get eaten by the labeller i have had so many of these cassettes get eaten by the labelmaker that i will not use this machine or these cassettes anymore once the machine starts to eat the tape there is no repair the whole cassette is ruined i have had new tapes get ruined practically right away i am through with brother labelling products this is the second brother labelmaker that i have had that has done this these cassettes are so expensive and then so many get ruined 
save your money i wish i would have read the earlier reviews on this mouse had i done so i wouldn t have purchased this one no sence in kicking a dead horse but i concur with any and all of the previous complaints frustration is the wor 
great picture but that s about it i purchased this card because i have on another computer the aiw pro the pro card has been a great card and i thought the would be also well the tv picture is great once you get the card working the catalyst software to record programs is worthless i cannot get it to connect with titan tech support is also worthless i have been using the gemstar software from the pro to see what tv guide programs are playing i can record programs while i am at the computer but there is no vcr type functionality to record while i am away i am extremely disappointed with ati amd that they would sell a product that does not work fully and at the same time not support it properly i hope they are not naive enough to think they will get repeat business with this kind of customer service 
used once until the batteries died the battery compartment is nearly impossible to open without breaking the latch that holds it in place after great difficulty i was able to open the battery case exactly once and load my first set of batteries some stroke of luck prevented the tiny plastic tab from breaking this first time after the batteries eventually died and had to be replaced i wasn t as lucky with the cover inspecting the broken pieces revealed a number of basic latch design flaws it seems the designers of this product failed to take snap fit design engineering design review anyone 
very dissapoinyed by brother products my last brother fax a higher end model just stopped working can t find anyonme to work on these so you throw it away and buy a new one i thought i would stay simple and bought a but it jams continually and my biggest problem is only out of faxes sent goes through it keeps disconnecting my phone company says they have compatability problems with brother verizon so i am returning this for a higher end model again i guess you get what you pay for don t buy this or any brother product 
panasonic cd player is not continuous the panasonic cd player has a good sound quality but does not automatically change from one cd to the next it requires manual switching via the remote control to change from one cd to another this feature was not explicitly stated in the specifications and is misleading to a buyer who is seeking continuous playing of all five cd s 
nothing but problems i bought this television in december the problems occurred in march i made a request to have a repairman come and he basically replaced everything in the unit the problem was the light engine now that the parts in my tv are brand new i thought my problems were well behind me but i was wrong after it was fixed days ago more problems occurred when i try to change the contrast brightness etc the settings would reset once i turned off the tv also sometimes the tv won t turn on it would just make this weird buzzing noise the picture is now worse than before for all the new owners please advise that you will be dissapointed once it turns into a dog like mine did the tv may work great out of the box and you may be tempted to write a star review on here shortly after viewing the tv but wait until months approaches and i guarantee you will have nothing but problems write a review after months and you will see what i mean 
good potential but nasty the tomtom has great features but i returned mine first the maps are very dated this makes it iffy at best it has terrific potential if it worked you can use a pda stylus on the map sitting at home outside on batteries to plan a trip it s amazing but i wanted to plan a mile trip myself using it s internal maps and waypoints but i tried a local test first i used roads as waypoints main roads this way i can force the tomtom to use my routes i did not like it s choices since it is a dated map database i set up a local route and started to follow it it took me to the first road waypoint no problem but it would not go past the first waypoint i would go down the road first waypoint then it would tell me to take a u turn i did then it said take another u turn it had me going in circles perhaps it s not made to use roads as waypoints but all indications it gave were that it would the manual was no help support was no help so it went back i have ordered a garmin i hope this is ok i have taken the same trip from se fl usa to sc usa with a garmin c the garmin has maps that you cannot update but got me to my destination no problem i don t recommend this tomtom do research go to manufactures websites and look at unit manuals hope this helps 
crap i had a pronto neo for less than a year before the touchscreen failed after i dropped it feet onto a hardwood floor the unit has a very cheap feel especially for the price i wasn t at all surprised when it stopped working the pc software that you use to customize the touchscreen is crap the touchscreen is very tedious to customize i write software for a living and i still found it cumbersome to customize the touchscreen i can t imagine the average consumer being able to customize this unit given the effort that it takes to struggle with the software and to transfer the information from your pc to the remote the whole point of the pronto neo is that you can customize the touch screen unless you are very comfortable with computer applications do not buy this unit aside from the touchscreen s fagility is not sensitive enough to the touch and the area of the screen is too small given the size of the remote did i mention the batteries did not last more than months in short this product is crap i might consider buying another one if it sold for or less 
worst battery i have ever seen battery discharges only in minutes of talking i personally never recommend this item answering machine is good but battery is worst 
low quality low cost cable this is a cheap cable in both cost and quality when connected between my voodoo card and my mag innovision dxf monitor the picture quality was poor with severe quotghostingquot of the screen this cable does not have the cylinders on each end as most monitor cables do i assume the lack of these cylinders is what causes the degradation in signal quality 
not ready for prime time overall it works ok for turning on and off groups of components setting the inputs and outputs and controlling the volume from the proper component however i hoped to replace four remotes with one when i bought this and this has not been the case i ve still got two remotes lying around and i m not selling the others on ebay either ! even though it loads all of the functions associated with a particular device there are big mismatches between functions in the factory remotes and the functions in the logitech this is the case even though most of my components are pretty mainstreem stuff sony kv hs denon avr panasonic dmr es directv h there is no facility in logitech s online software to let them know that their data is afu so much for continually updating our database making this work has been a huge time sink the software is stupid and beurocratic sometimes asking irrelevant questsions eg what input does the dvd player use when you re setting up to watch the satellite while cheaper than some the unit is very expensive compared to other universal remotes i should have bought eg sony rmvl 
never received it this item was promised to me as a free bonus for my purchase of casio exilim camera but was never delivered now amazon wants me to review it so here your are 
cool while it lasted i purchased this months ago and have been using it nonstop since unfortunately after dropping it the thing no longer works so it isn t very sturdy the screen is bigger and it is much more watchable than the video ipod one thing that really sucked about it besides breaking down on me was that the mp part of it was annoying if you were listening to music and then watched a video when you went back to pick up listening to your music you would have to start completely over in your playlist or annoyingly have to scroll down until you found your place anyways overall i loved this thing while it worked but definitely won t be buying another one ! i don t want to spend bucks on something that just breaks so easily 
did not work for me i bought this cable to connect an hp laptop running xp to an hp laserjet l printer xp did not recognize the cable as new hardware i tried to install manually using the install new hardware feature but that didn t work either i finally bought a belkin cable about twice the price and it worked like a charm 
noisy cd changer that just died with no recourse i purchased the unit less than years ago based on some online reviews as soon as i set it up i wondered why everytime the unit was switched on it went through and read the cds in order even if i was just listening to the radio this process was noisy and it sounded like the motorized mechanism within the unit was cheap i called philips and while they are very nice on the phone they said the noise was normal yesterday i put some cds in and the unit now has failed the drawers do not open and the cds are locked within since the unit is more than year old philips will not replace the unit and has no method of servicing the unit they have no instructions for how to remove my cds from the machine and their most helpful suggestion is for me to take it to a repair shop 
too bright ! not for light sleepers we have had ours for almost a year it still works great but there is one big problem the display is a white violet bright light great for visibility of the clock when you need it but unfortunately even when it s on the lowest setting it lights up our whole room ! my husband sleeps through it fine but i need a dark room to fall asleep and i always have to throw a sweater or towel over it we finally gave it up and switched back to our old clock radio 
mechanism so loud you can hear it over the film i recently purchased this model from a source outside amazon it is easily unlocked to play all region dvds and the picture quality is excellent however the unit would only work using the s video connector not separate connections the spinning of the dvd itself was ridiculously loud 
mine was doa too how do i assign a rating as several other people have experienced my unit is also doa i received it plugged it in pressed clean and the motor started up i popped open the cover put in the disc i wanted cleaned and pressed clean again nothing terrible quality control whats worse is the unit case is glued together no way to open it up to try to fix the electronics inside without mutilating it and voiding warranty 
horrible dvd player i have bought and returned three of these units now each one has been defective and finally i just gave up on returning the system the dvd player constantly gives bad disc errors and skips if there is even the slightest smudge on a disc the sound quality is very nice for the price but since the player doesn t work it s essentially useless this is a complete rip off at any price point 
ea blo not for minolta dimage xi since this rechargable battery was clearly listed under accessories on the minolta dimage xi amazon web page i purchased one to serve as a backup it was delivered well before i received the camera imagine my surprise when i finally received the dimage xi and opened up the sharp battery package to find that the battery was too wide to fit in the camera or the battery charger which came with the camera ! this battery is not an accessory that fits with the dimage xi i have sent it back 
did not charge i purchased the garmin forerunner but when i received the watch it would charge so i have not been able to use it and now it is back with the manufacturer garmin warranty is for year so everthing should work out but i have not received it back yet so i do not have too much to say 
it will ruin your games i bought this for my son who has had a few scratches on some of his games he followed the directions and the game doctor put a perfectly circular scratch all the way around the disc completely ruining it kids being kids didn t give up and tried another disc again completely ruining the disc the kind of scratch this will not get out ps the resurfacing fluid is primarily distilled saline try that first with some muscle behind a soft cloth you have a better chance saving your games customer service is hopeless i would warn anyone to not buy this product perhaps i got a bum machine but digital innovations will do nothing to rectify the situation i had to leave a star the system wouldn t let me leave zero 
not for use with canon powershot it seems nice enough and it s cheap but it is apparently incompatible with the canon powershot digital elphs for use with those cameras buy sandisck instead seriously 
had to throw half of them away i m not one to enjoy buying a pack of cd s and having to throw half of them away because the drive can no longer read them they deteriorate quickly 
works well but way uncomfortable i will agree with that other review that states this headset is uncomfortable the ear cushions are fine but the frame presses into my head quite hard i added some padding which helped but it is still a poor design i can t complain about the function though mic is clear and sound quality is good for my purposes 
it s not worth it i bought this after havinf the belkin tunecast ii and have to say that i cannot see any improvement the signal is too weak tooooooo weak 
bad sensitivity at low temperatures when outsite temperature is around celsius degrees or below and the car and the unit it s not yet warm enough the detector acts very strange it gives sudden false alarm like k ku alarm in spots where when it has normal temperature gives no alarm and sometimes when on the highway from nothing it gives a sudden alarm of strength and then nothing my old cobra had no strange alarms like this one and it was smaller the spiral coil it s not good to short you need a straight onemaybe the scale would be better if it was from to 
before you buy i just recieved my brandnew mb sd memory card from newegg a few hours ago it came in factory packaging and i know is brand new immidiatly upon putting it in my card reader it said card read error i have put it in serveral other computers and cameras in an attempt to format it this card is shot and i just got it this is not the first pny to do this to me i gave one away previously in frustrastion thinking it was my computer it was not i tried to call there tech support but at first it gave me only the option of where to buy their products when i called again it was closed and offered no info on sd memory i went online and looked for support for sd but wouldn t you know they don t have any faqs on it i tried to write them an email on it but there mail server crashed and my minutes of typing to there tech support was in vein i have read that many others have recieved cards that didn t work when they got them or failed after or erase cycles in short don t by pny spend the extra money and get something that will work if it doesn t work i don t think tech support will help you if you want to roll the dice and take a chance and something that probably wont work than pny is for you if you don t believe me call their tech support you try to ask them about there fine sd memory go to their website to see what they have to say about there fine products spend the minutes to look into it before buying it on impuls 
false advertising i ordered this complete kit naively thinking that the box would include what it said it included with the label applicator white matte labels and white matte inserts for the price i paid and what the product image showed on this site i expected to get what i ordered instead i received a box with a sticker covering over the original contents list giving a modified count of only cd labels and no inserts at all people before you purchase this item or any item here or elsewhere make sure you get what you pay for because i certainly didn t 
i need help finding hp colr cartridges i have found this site disappointing on finding my tri color ink that i need for my hp this web site needs more choices if the store sells it you should be able to find it here 
simply does not work i purchased this card installed it on a jetway vt motherboard with windows xp installed this ruined my installation of windows xp and i had to reformat my drive i thought it was simply because i had a cheap motherboard so i tried it in my dell same thing i have always purchased beklin products in the past but will not go near anything beklin now if you buy this card it s a lucky dip as to whether or not it will work on your system please buyer beware 
hdmi port unreliable maybe it s just the one i got but my hdmi port seems to be very unreliable most of the time it will be working fine but once in a while for no reason the screen goes black and stays black for an extended period of time if i switch back to using component cables it works immediately but the picture with component cables always looks noticeably worse i have tried connecting it to my cable box with different hdmi cables and connecting it to two different computers with a dvi to hdmi cable the same thing happened each time so i don t think it was the cable or the source of the hdmi input that had any problems so basically i m stuck watching it with component video which does not look very good 
terrible don t buy it don t waste your money you cannot see the screen it doesn t line up well with the outside cover so you can use your dial it shifts and turns the volume up to full blast 
freezes and tech help not good i purchased dvd express and it never worked i spent endless time with tech support the old story about it must be your computer did not fly either my machine is a media type and it far exceeds the system requirements advertised by ads i exchanged the item and it was supposedly checked out before i got it same problems tech support told me i was the only person having trouble with this product they need to check out a few websites that review products there are hundreds of bad reviews very few good ones my only mistake was not reading them before i wasted my time and money ads also told me it would not work with ulead s movie factory some of the software it came bundled with but that was uleads problem i should use cap wiz their program duh guess what it did not work with their program either ulead said they had several complaints with ads s product their final solution hold on to the product and maybe they will have a new version of cap wiz and that might work save yourself time money and aggravation buy another product ! p s since ads doesn t consider the product defective they will not refund your money or allow you trade it in for an upgrade i don t think they want a product like that either the only reason i gave one star is it was packed well ju 
unable to install despite reaching d link technical support from looking at the d link website and talking to five tech support staff it appears that there are countless versions of this card each with different driver software the one i got came with a cd with the wrong drivers with tech support i finally found the mb driver file i was supposed to download however they did not provide any instructions on how to install the new driver the normal automatic approach did not work and their instructions did not match the screens i was getting on windows xp sp so i called back again and again and again despite being given a case file each time i was asked the same questions including what exactly is wrong and each time i was told to do the same thing install from the cd reboot remove the program reboot install from the new driver reboot remove the program talk to a senior tech support person install from cd reboot etc it would have been easier to send the card with the right files on the cd a clearly designed website would be second best and tech support that knows what they re doing and speaks intelligble english would be a nice last resort i spent three hours calling d link technical support and speaking to five people and they could not tell me how to install the software for this card i am not alone in this experience see cnet s web site user reviews of the dwl ganother reviewer reports that this software damaged his operating system i believe he is right it appears to have damaged my screen font for windows message boxes i have been unable to repair it the dwl g is bad news i give them two stars cause they actually have tech support though in this case it was utterly worthless back it goes 
not supported these will not work in a dvd recorder to record tv it didn t say on the webpage but on the back of the discs it states that the discs support recording only at x and x my dvd recorder supports dvd rw media but to record television x recording must be supported 
v hz only classic brick ac dc transformer is for north america only i hoped for a quotdual voltage quot ac dc convertor which could be used overseas 
good except the compact flash card gets stuck i use this in conjunction with the sandisk ultra ii gb compact flash card i like it but the flash card doesn t slide in easily sometimes it get stuck halfway as if the unit has not been designed properly and the sliders for the card offer enough give to slide the card to the left or right of the pins to add insult to injury both the reader and flash card are manufactured by sandisk therefore they should work seamlessly together but pathetically they don tid much rather pay more for a reader that worked great rather than save a few dollars for a reader that makes you work every time you use the thing for comparison my camera accepts the card perfectly there is no give at all but instead is an effortless process not a quality reader other than that it works as expected surprisingly the reader doesn t topple over as easily as i thought it would it stands vertically and looks like it might fall over when trying to slide the card in sliding the card in a handed process so one hand holds the unit while the other slides it in removing the card is extremely easy that s a one handed process eject the card from the pc s drive and then remove it data transfer from the card to pc is very quick overall i m glad to have it but it s an annoyance to use it i hate the card getting stuck halfway in the reader 
broke after months i bought this memory card for my canon sd after using it for approximately months with no problems whatsoever i took a video and the card just flat out broke first the screen said image not available and then memory card error i tried everything to fix it but nothing worked i lost all the pictured i had stored on it and found it was cheaper and easier to just buy a new memory card instead of paying to get it fixed now i have a panosonic one and i m really happy with it my advice splurge on the more expensive card from a reliable brand and it ll be worth it

very well built but bad flaws based on c net reviews amazon com reviews and reviews by ilounge i decided to get the v versus the iflip the reviews i had seen on line were fairly accurate but i think the reviewers were too enamored with style over function the v is very well built it s solid ipod integration is very nice and there is excellent fit and finish the speakers provide pretty good sound and make a good portable system for use on the road in fact the reviews used this as one of the real descriminators but when am i going to use this without headphones for me at least a better sounding audio system isn t as important on a device like this additionally the importance of an ir remote is over sold for a personal device at least for my personal use profile in airplanes and other vehicles all else being the same these would have been selling points for the v however all else is not equal there are two flaws which are driving me to return the product no aspect ratio selection now many posters at ilounge had discussed this issue and recent posts claimed this problem was fixed with a menu selection but the unit i bought on dec does not allow selection of i sent multiple messages to si and received a response from nick stating that there was not a firmware fix available for the unit that leaves only a few possible conclusions a there is no fix and the few posts of a fix are plantedb there is a fix in new units but the vendor is unwilling to offer a firmware upgradec there is a fix and there is no way to upgrade the unit s firmwarec is the most likely scenario but in any case it s a deal breaker to me watching i tunes downloaded video in widehead mode is simply not acceptable for a product in this price category i don t mind re ripping my dvds with the proper wide screen aspect ratio but there is no way to play native video without video stretching the v battery doesn t provide power to the ipod the ipod battery drains as the v system is being used the cheaper competition keeps the ipod battery topped off so when the video system drains you still have a fully charged ipod for your portable use also if your ipod battery is drained you cannot use the v again not so with the cheaper competing product ill do my wrap up by repeating the v is a very well built product it s look and feel is very nice and if i didn t have to contend with issue i would probably live with issue however there appears to be no way to assure you ll get a unit with the firmware upgrade if it exists i cannot recommend the v 
if it didn t say sony on the front i definitely wouldn t know sony made this it s crap i put it down on a table it shuts it s self off it refuses to play some regular store bought cds no scratches it eats batteries it s very very loud when it does decide to play a cd i am very disappointed i was better off keep my year old pannasonic it has better rumble control and plays all my cds 
why can i not find good dvd storage this is just a general review of all dvd cases i have not found any that even come close to meeting my needs i was stationed in germany for over years and anyone who had been there knows that afn sucks so dvd s is your only source of video entertainment my collection grew to more than i have been trying to find a good case that hold equal number of title books as it does dvd s but that seems to be asking to much or the manufacturers know that by giving odd numbers you will have to buy more of the product to support your collection properly then when you look at the furniture options everything seems to be made for function and not style at all they are generally pressboard p oss and nothing i would want to keep in my garage i hope that some of the manufacturers read this and come up with real solutions cause there is definately a market out there that is waiting to be satisfied 
now i m kinda p ssed off i am really upset with these nothing really on these headphones are pros they are mostly all conspros volume remote which doesn t even help peak volume anyway so this really isn t a pro cons these are some of the most quiet headphones i ve ever used in any of my players ! the impedance is ohms one of the worst impedances you can get there is small bass on these ! the bass is completely bloated and tinny the treble is in a tunnel honestly is there a long tube in between these these have horrible comfort the rubber headband makes them extremely oversized these are not durable ! every single pair of these broke in the same space with good care the left side of the earcup which features the right side s cord if there not durable they are not portable either sure they fold up but that s all the portability you ll get out of them they break one in my backpack one putting them on the way i always do the headband on my head and the speakers correctly on the ear so yeah ! i m kinda mad even though i m getting my back the fact that these headphones have bad sound comfort durability and portability why on earth would i give these a good rating they are wasting about a week of my life never again will i buy from jensen 
another hp printer doa i was excited about being able to afford a color laser jet printer until the hp printed a grand total of pages and then died a fuser problem this is the second hp printer that has died a premature death on me in months the other a b w laserjet working with hp is a real nightmare when i called i was put on hold for minutes each with a series of customer service reps who could not help me finally they said they would ship out a replacement unit within days days later no printer and i called to see what had happened they did not ship because they had written down a wrong phone number for me they said the unit would be shipped out asap it did not arrive until nearly another days had passed by then i had to buy another printer and just refused delivery on the hp i would never buy another my apple laser printer lasted years with no problems 
did not perform as advertised this unit failed to provide reliable power to my new toshiba satellite a laptop it cycled on and off every seconds it powered a watt lamp okay but wouldn t start a watt heat lamp at all product spec sheet says it can supply watt surge and watts for min and is rated at watts continuous my laptop power supply is rated at a input at vac and if it drew a constantly i agree that it would need to watts which exceeds the continuous rating of this inverter however even at that power demand the inverter should run it for min but only manages sec in addition i doubt that the laptop power supply actually draws a full amps continuously i talked to linksys support and they suggested returning the unit for replacement or refund so i did it did not work for me maybe it would work for a laptop that only needs watts but i wouldn t recommend it for more than that 
be forewarned if your thinking of using this with airport express this amazon listing also suggests buying the soundsticks along with airport express if you re thinking of connecting them to the usb port of express apple says it won t work apple airport express faqs 
delivered inoperable the pd m did not play cds without static bounces other noise i initially thought it was the cd cartridge or cd however i have two of these units the media tesed fine on my other unit 
creative zen nano minus the creative nano sucks hrs and calls to tech suppoert and the unit still will not be recognized by my computer one of the tech support help points was to use one of the usb ports on the back of the computer rather than the front not in the instructions they say that the ports on the back of computers are more capable that those on the front i asked them why they would design a device with a inch cable that required you to crawl under your desk to plug it in each time when there is a perfectly good port that works for every other plug in device i have on the front all i got was a sheepish yeah i know from the techie still did not work on the rear port then they wanted me to go in and do some monkey work with the computer s register forget it it goes back it s like buying a radio for your car and then being told you need to work on the transmission to get the radio to turn on what a piece of crap amazon should have an option to rate stars 
poor radio small buttons i purchased the rino specifically because it also had the radio and noaa features fortunately i read the other reviews on this model as well as the and versions that complained about poor radio performance i tested the unit and sure enough the radio performance is absolutely terrible and i was able to return the unit to amazon in time for a full refund be sure to test this yourself also the buttons are very small and the zoom function is impractical as you constantly have to activate the zoom and then slide the zoom level up and down i returned the rino and purchased a garmin etrex legend c color display for about the same price i will miss the noaa feature of the but not the radio this is an overpriced gps spend the money on a color display unit instead and you will not be disappointed 
can t make work in dell dim tried upgrade of ps to watts bios i ve set to auto not onboard cant rate what isn t working 
missed the boat with this one while the tivo service is amazing they really missed the boat with this product the idea behind this unit is to be able to record two shows at one time a really great idea that has been available in cable and dish systems for some years however this unit really can t do that for many people you can only record two shows if you meet all of the following conditions you subscribe to cable tv at least one show you want to record is on analouge not digital cable the other show you want to record is on either digital or analouge cableif you have an antenna no dice dish newtwork or directtv no dice want to record a show on hbo and showtime at the same time no dice basically you can never really know if the shows you want to record can be recorded or not without having to cross reference them to what part of your cable service they are on tivo has the right idea but clearly did not execute it with this product 
zero stars actually sounds like two paper cups on a string no tone quality at all it doesn t matter which channel you broadcast on they all bleed over each other i can t believe i bought something this bad oh yeah it humms when you move it around trying for better reception this is the first bad review i ve ever writte 
serious drop in quality i have always been a fan of sony because they make quality products that are userfriendly that is why i was in a state of complete shock that this little blue cd walkman is made by sony because it is on the other end of the spectrum compared to what they usually manufacture first the bad the control buttons sound changing tracks pause etc are tiny and nearly impossible to read i found myself having to hold the cd player up to my face to find the right button and i do not have any vision problems the little lcd screen is hard to read as well next the sound quality is poor and has a cheap watered down feel to it then there are the stock headphones that the product comes with these are cheap and don t fit well i bought a yellow psyc sony walkman a couple years ago and that one is times the product that this one is the sound is near perfect and the buttons are easy to see and use the headphones fit well and the whole package has lasted with no issues at all i wouldn t write sony off simply b c of this product but i would definitely do some research prior to purchasing a walkman from them 
nice while it lasted i bought this mouse a couple months ago to use with my macbook pro i loved it until a couple days ago when it decided to stop working it s not connecting to the usb adapter any more i changed the battery and tried the connect button and nothing sad isn t it 
poor quality control i have had various wifi networking solutions in my home and office for several years while some linksys units have worked for me more often i have found them undependable in particular the wpsgu set up fine but i almost always had to cycle the power to get it to work each time i printed not worth the hassle 
very basic a map has more information this is a waste of money garmin wants you to spend up to for a map that will give you any information if you need a basic map save your money stop at a rest area and get a free one 
please don t buy a zune i bought the zune around christmas time of i used it on a daily basis and was happy with it early in april it stopped working after spending three hours on the phone with four technicians microsoft accepted my return for repair and sent me a box to ship it to their repair facility two weeks later i received the zune back with a note that the zune was not repaired because the problem it had was not within the warranty limitations they did not tell me what the problem was only that they did not fix it i was more then dismayed i had spent almost with tax and shipping to buy this product i did not abuse it in any way please think twice before buying this product if and when it breaks microsoft will not fix it and you will be stuck with a paperweight 
not worth the money i recently bought this unit after returning defective models by cobra and i ll have to say there is no improvement as i had thought my impression was pay more and get a better product but in this case that is not true this detector gave me nothing more than a series of false alarms or no alarms when radar was detected correctly it was either too late less than mile or the alert signal did not increase as i approached the radar making me think it was another false alarm thankfully cobra covers their units for one full year and it is on its way back for replacement i will say that their customer service is much better than my luck with their radar detectors i spoke to a live rep right away something rare to get these days ! a ups postage paid sticker was sent right out to me i hope the replacement unit works correctly 
ripoff bad deal here i got the printer only to find that it doesn t come with a cord to connect it to your computer after wasting my time going to three different places the cheapest one was for amazon s advertisement that this is free with the purchase of a camera is misleading to say the least as it s not honest about the extra you have to spend just for a connecting cord in my opinion this has been very frustrating and a total ripoff ! 
doesn t match well with my ypt keyboard i got this stand as a kind of freebie when i purchased the excellent ypt keyboard at first i was baffled by the lack of instructions and the apparent lack of attachment screws by reading another of the reviews here in amazon i learned that the screws arrive inserted into the bottoms of the x pieces thanks to the person who pointed this out as it isn t intuitively obvious even to those of us long accustomed to putting together small mechanical devices for our children i managed to figure out the proper hex key wrench to remove the screws and then quickly put together the keyboard stand once you have all of the pieces and the proper tool it s not rocket science however it soon became apparent that the stand isn t really made for my model keyboard if you line the keyboard up directly on the stand it rocks back and forth the only way to get it to stay put is to angle it a bit which looks kind of odd and there s a constant danger that someone will knock the keyboard right off of the stand onto the floor someone suggested a double velcro strategy not bad ! but this is a makeshift solution that can only partly mask the fact that the stand was never really designed for the keyboard i own i d love to know what reasonably inexpensive stand would work better than this one 
someone from case logic please read my review along with the before me i will admit that hands down case logic is the best cd wallets you can buy they are usually constructed with great quality and you actually feel that you get your money s worth even the protection it provides for the cd s that you put it in it is outstanding i m a scratch freak and i ve noticed that case logic wallets do not put any scratches what soever on your cd s or dvd s not even those little really light ones that you only see in bright light nothing bad to say about them at all it was pretty much everything a cd wallet should be at it s finest but new this year is the redesigned version of these wallets and they are terrible ! the previous models were superior to any other cd wallet out there now they have brown stitching put against black koskin leather the handle looks completely cheap and it comes from inside the wallet letting you know that there is no telling what is holding it in place the mesh screen in the handle is gone so no more labels can be placed in it they are seriously terrible and that s all you can find when you go out shopping for one i found this out and quickly rushed to my favorite local electronic store and bought the last previous model koskin cd wallet that i was lucky to find in the very back of the shelf the rest were the new ugly and cheaply made ones at the same price i bought that wallet just in case i needed it within the year and good thing i did because i needed it and now need another i m now out of space and in desperate need for a new cd wallet but i refuse to buy one of these new ones it doesn t matter if you get the koskin leather which is my favorite or the fabric ones they are both repulsive in this years model so now i sit with old spool casings that used to hold all my blank cd s now holding my real cd s and dvd s until case logic comes back into focus and sells a better quality and improved this time for real cd wallet this is pretty much everything that the previous reviews say i just completely agree with everything they say and i m hoping that somebody from case logic or word gets out to the people and they notice a huge slump in their sales this year please case logic no more brown stitching poor quality handles and less features in your next model design of these wallets my fingers are crossed 
antonline will steal your money i bought this from antonline this product does not fit all explorists as their advertisement says it is not even close to fitting the explorist xl i returned it in perfect shape i spent nearly with shipping both ways and antonline refunded to me the extra shipping was their fault and the restocking fees are ridiculous ! i advise you to not throw your money at this poisonous enterprise 
usa mapsend topo d with magellan explorist xl i puchased the usa mapsend topo d to use on my laptop my goal was to download route track and waypoint data from my explorist xl gps to store and view on my computer there was trouble from the start my gps only has a usb cable while the software will only read from a com port once i got the data into the computer i had to translate it so the software would recognize the format these were supposed to work together the detail for tracking through the woods was totally unacceptable also i have to always have disk installed before i can even run the program there was supposed to be an option to not require the disk during installation i guess the program ignored this the explorist works great ! if possible i would return this software and recommend to anyone not to use it ! 
kills computer un stoppable shriek alarm i mistakenly believed the hype that this thing would protect my computer from being killed but instead this thing has killed my computer for the second time in days emitting an un stoppableie can t turn the feature off shriek alarm how do smart talented people idiotically convince themselves that a home product should have an ear piercing shriek alarm that can t be defeated silenced in addition to doing far far more damage than it can ever prevent ask yourself do you want this un stoppable ear piercing shriek alarm going off in your house at a m i bought one apc product and so far they re defective and deliterious to the use of my computer it s a matter of time before it s deliterious to my sleep 
no built in microphone this is for video only i was surprised when i got this product it is for video only all logitech webcams i used before come with an integrated microphone this one does need a separate microphone to talk through the net there is a tiny microphone in the package though but i am really uncomfortable to hang it on my ear when i need to talk also how can a headphone be shared by more than one person you may need to purchase a bigger microphone to free your ear up and or to share it 
do not use as a data drive i have been a long time user of sony s minidisc equipment i mainly liked the removable media feature for about i could copy a whole cd to one regular minidisc and keep it in my media library the early units seem to be made better the more recent units look to be cheaply made there is one inherent design flaw with a media that has to spin the read write heads have to move back and forth across the media and this is the weak point there is a tiny ribbon cable that attaches to the read write head this cable will fail in time it may be months it may be three years but it will happen when it does you will get the famous blankdisk error whenever you insert your disc this will destroy whatever data was on the disc no great loss if you use the minidisc for music only but a potential disaster if you use it for backing up data which i used to do i researched this on minidisc forums and found that it had happened to others i used minidiscs for data backup because the mb discs were perfect for my needs after loosing valuable data i have put all of my units and dozens of recorded and blank discs in a drawer probably never to be used again 
returned it after hour i bought the unit from best buy when i got home the unit would not play any of my mp s h format unprotected in addition it was extremely choppy when playing uncompressed vob files wirelessly the remote was horrible and ff rw was useless i would not buy this product if anyone wants to use h supersmall size videos mb per movie 
annoying popping noises i ve had these speakers for about years now and i m really not happy them there is some hissing but that is to be expected with wireless speakers the most annoying thing is the popping noises i have tried moving the speakers closer to the transmitter only to find that the distance makes no difference i thought the popping noise was some kind of local interference so i actually walked all around the yard but the noise stayed the same i got a warranty replacement of the transmitter because when i moved the attached antenna it caused static in the speakers and i thought perhaps the antenna was somehow not properly connected inside the housing but the popping noise persisted i can t recommend these speakers best to consider others 
junk here is why it is junk creates a buzz on the line not enough room in back of phone for the cord if you wall mount the lcd is pathetic can t see it in a normally lit room this should be back lit and numbers should be bigger all in all a real dissappointment and it is going back 
misleading advertising i was not aware until purchasing that the u smart drive by kingston would not run just any software but only certain programs therefore it is mostly useless to me however i will use it as a general back up thumb drive 
too buggy i have a linksys wrtg wireless router with notebooks a printer and desktops all working without problem through comcast cable i use wep and mac address filtering linksys support very kindly spent about two hours trying to help me get this supposedly compatible phone to work but it can not connect to the wireless router i think they rushed this to market before it was ready 
i hate this drive i bought it thinking it will be a sturdy drive and lexar anyway had a good name in flash drives but to my utter dissapointment barely months after use it started behaving funny it won t copy data file more than mb while copying back more than mb data from this drive to my laptop it will hang and then computer will not be able to read it i tried with laptops maybe it has bad sectors but its as good as a floppy disk for me now and i m using it only for sharing keeping small amount of data highly dissapointed 
not suitable for heavy books this bookstand despite the description is not suitable for heavy books if you put heavy books on this the stand that props up the whole unit is likely to snap off 
nice gps receiver but not user friendly with the map software i ve owned a magellan meridian gold gps receiver for years it worked great until last week when it got wet and stopped working it is supposed to be waterproof and sealed to iec ipx standards but apparently it isn t magellan charged me to have it repaired i ordered the explorist xl as an upgrade and for use as my primary unit with the intention of keeping the meridian gold as a backup but i returned the explorist after learning how difficult it is to use with the mapsend direct route map software also the map software will only work with one magellan gps receiver at a time so you either have to completely uninstall and reinstall it each time you want to use a different gps unit or you have to buy another copy of the software and install it on a different computer i don t mind paying for a second copy of the software but who wants to buy another computer until magellan addresses these issues i recommend buying something else 
hawking hi gain is really a no gain i would have to agree with the majority of assessment of this product on amazon this product fails on every count most significantly product does not perform as described signal strength not significantly improved in fact no change in reception at all i have used this in my one story home and in a caf i work at with no effect whatsoever when there is a rebate it is more trouble than it is work 
street atlas hh provides wrong route and hard to use i bought the blue logger and both street atlas and sa hh for my dell xv no problem with the blue logger gps but my complaints are as follows delorme did not include the blue logger manager software on the hh now they want to sell it separately for additional very weird marketing strategy indeed the software for the pocket pc is very difficult to use not very intuitive it seems the hand held software was developed as an afterthought from the software for the pc it is poorly designed and appeared was not fully tested by normal users prior to releasing to market it is very cumbersome and slow to determine a route even with a mhz axim it is slow worse yet the route is often wrong for example this afternoon i use sa to determine a route to a friend s house had i followed that route i would come to a dead end street and have to back track about miles to get to another correct route to my destination luckily i decided to use my paper map later i tried microsoft mapping on the internet and it actually gave me the correct routing last week for another location sa found the wrong location for a given address which would take me about miles off luckily i knew where it was and ignored the routing from sa hh many other mapping softwares for hh will allow one to use it with hand and often with the finger but not with sa hh after weeks of using it i found myself going back to my old paper map for example if i had not calculated a route and just simply use the gps and map to travel the software only show the street i was on but no name given and no street name shown for upcoming cross streets it does not help when you are lost sa maps seems to be several years old and not very up to date i guess that s why delorme does not want to clearly advertise this issue i am seriously considering giving up sa and consider this as my learning mistake and looking at microsoft street trip or later in q iguidance who is supposed to have the latest map i am not alone in this as several other users have also complained on delorme user forum i wish i had read that forum before buying delorme software well live and learn 
difficult i bought this for my granddaughter and i have used other mp players and this one is horrible getting different computers to recognize it was impossible hello this is this stuff should just plug and play i thought i was back to dos and i am pretty computer savvy anyway save yourself and get an apple dell or phillips wow 
are you kidding good sound from a pair of headphones com on folks lets be real here the coby cv h headphones may have decent sound for a pair of cheap headphones but com ontheyre only or less i ve tried them on a non amplified computer monitior at work and they sound decent the bass is average at best if these have a mm driver then i d hate to hear what a smaller one in a coby set would sound like ive also tried them on my at home amplified pc set up and they distort way too easily the bass distorts at almost the slightest bit of bass and i concur with those who say that it s a roll of the dice to get a good working pair as the left speaker in my set is a bit weak i mean let s face it these are some pretty cheap headphones if you want a cheap but great sounding pair of headphones you better look to a set in the range take for instance the koss ktx pro titaniums for here on amazon they re sold for upwards of at retailers like radio shack and from all the glowing reviews they re a hellava set of headphones i gave this set stars only because they re decent for a cheap pair but for audiophiles stear clear 
coasters i purchased this item and was excited to get them but burning my first dvds they re all coasters ! arg pass memorex and go for a more expensive media like verbatim 
iogear dvi cs i got this device to connect two laptops and two desktops to one screen and one keyboard and mouse the mouse is a microsoft intellimouse and the keyboard is a ms internet keyboard pro none of these devices work with the iogear cs i have to plug my mouse and keyboard on the back of the cs to be able to use them but lose all the keyboard short cuts functionality also after some hours the usb devices plug on the back are not available to the my windows or linux os requiring me to unplug and plug the devices again 
dead after only year i bought this dvd player after my sony player died prematurely is it just me or are dvd players supposed to have a longer life this dvd player looks nice and works fine when it is working the player is a bit noisy when reading the discs though but the bottom line is that it just stopped working after only year of use i expected an improvement over my sony player and i am sorely disappointed 
junk i got what i paid for allows for four frequency options at the top of the dial all of which were picking up real broadcast signals in my area 
gains time and display isnt very clear bought this despite mixed reviews from previous customers as mentioned by others it gains approximately min in a week also the indiglo display isnt that great it is very hard to see the time display during the day bottomline always look through customer reviews and think hard and long if a product you are considering buying has bad reviews update display is all messed up after just one battery change stay away from this produc 
watch out i don t dispute that bose is a leader in speaker technology but there is a reason this item is discontinued it locks up when playing certain dvds sometimes after selecting play movie it won t get past the menu you have to guide it to the first chapter or else it will sit endlessly on the menu screen other dvds will play fine but if you happen to shut off the system without removing the dvd the next time you turn it on it will say bad disc and locks up you can t play you can t eject nothing you have to unplug it and essentially reboot the system maybe i got the lemon i don t know but it s worth writing a review given the fairly expensive price tag and the assumed quality the goes along with the name bose this system is definitely an exception to that rule 
caveat emptor despite being sold as an x fi card this particular model does not use the x fi chipset in fact it uses a variation of the audigy se chipset this is further confirmed by the fact that this card uses different drivers than the rest of the x fi line and is not recognized as an x fi card in games the main problem with this is you cannot uses any of the x fi features in games like you would expect try using this card in battlefield and you will see what i mean creative labs should be ashamed of themselves for this blatant act of marketing fraud when someone buys a ferrari they are expecting to get a ferrari not a honda with a ferrari emblem on the front but that is exactly what creative labs has done here they are marketing this sound card as a high end brand xfi when it is really a crippled version of the previous product line se model audigy they must have a glut of unsold chips and they thought they could pull a fast one on consumers with this cheap card i for one will be very cautious before i consider purchasing creative labs products in the future buyer beware 
p os crashes have to restart can t find router i have a netgear router and this wireless usb adapter i used the router wgt for several months just as a firewall directly hooked into my computer and never had any problems a few days ago however i moved my computer and decided to use this usb card and have had nothing but problems since half the time on start up my computer will not be connected so i have to reboot sometimes multiple reboots and then it still doesn t work and i have to unhook everything router cable modem etc i don t know how or why this happens but it seems to make everything stuck and nothing can communicate again until i do this this has happened several times so i am not imagining this i try various things but ultimately i have to shut everything down and actually unplug the modem from the power source for a few seconds then start everything back up i have cable and this is a procedure they have you do sometimes if things get locked up usually when you have a bad connection i didn t have to do this when it was just hooked into the router but with this usb p os i am doing it every day sometimes several times a day then it shows a connection of like and the router is in the very next room that is with the door open not feet away even now as i sit here writing this the little computer on the task bar showing my connection has dropped to yellow at least it hasn t changed red crap just did not kidding ! okay back on line this is an absolute p os which i would take back except i got it in a package deal with the router and i bought it a long time ago but never used it till now when it does work it is quick but when is the key word there do yourself a favor buy something else ! don t corporations test this crap before they mass market it 
be very careful i was wrongly advised by tech support to buy this instead of waiting for a new supply of power supplies from voodoo be sure your computer is supported because targus tech won t give you any info about voltage amperage or wattage on this thing so you can t safely maake it work with an unsupported computer so amazon as usual graciously took it back love amazon i just now read the other reviews and now consider myself lucky i didn t keep it and try to make it work 
pre review i cannot review this item because it cannot be used it was shipped with the wrong power supply and a software disk that won t work i have been delayed in my response because my wife died and my daughter has just been released from the hospital with the same ailment since this has caused me to go over the time limit what can i do about it now 
had to be replaced after months i ll begin by saying that i definitely do not recommend this hub after about months it completely malfunctioned my pc no longer recognized devices that were connected via the hub the indicators also stopped illuminating i replaced it promptly with a d link dub h and have not had any problems the d link has been in service for about months ill end by saying that i definitely do not recommend this hub good luck with your search 
horrible sound hardly any bass tinny treble not natural sounding for acoustic instruments concert jazz bands and string orchestras don t get these go with philips hs or sennheiser pmx instead both sound much better than this 
this thing collects dust like crazy and it s very hard to remove the dust frequent washing is the only way ! it fits zen vision m very well but the feel in hand is terrible especially when it collects tons of dust on it 
warning for gen ipods after reading all the reviews i could find online i thought this would be a perfect solution for a work related application i have a th generation gb video ipod a model which their website claims it supports my first purchase turned out to be a dud or so i thought and i exchanged it for another only after i called their customer support did i find out that the th gen gb video ipod is not supported not yet at least and that a new firmware is needed and is being worked on and will be released sometime next year needless to say i m extremely annoyed that nothing like this has been stated by the company in any way 
seems a good idea but poorly put togeter i purchased of the allsop dvd vhs organizers after i had or of them on the floor loaded with dvds i was going to move them to load the next batch but when i picked them up off the floor two of them came apart dropping the dvds on the floor knowing they were weak i tried to hold the next one together but pressed a little too hard on opposite corners the other two corners gave way and my hands came together scattering dvds all over the floor looking at the pieces that came apart i saw that hooks were molded into the plastic and were supposed to snap over ridges on the next piece but the hooks were too shallow to hold against the strain of holding them with the dvds facing upward and they were the same on all boxes i emailed the manufacturer from whom i had bought of the boxes and asked since it would be time consuming for me to send them back and costly for them what would they offer me if i just kept them and glued the corners together i had absolutely no response i ended up spending two evenings snapping the boxes apart glueing the attachment points and reassembling them i think they will be ok now but i would not have purchased them if i knew they were so poorly manufactured and i do not have any good thoughts about allsop s customer service 
material ok but the software is terrible these labels are of good quality and the print on them is ok but the program that comes with the package is horrible it is antiquated inflexible and downright poorly designed you have to view the page sideways there is no align feature the list goes on and on if you want to use these inserts be prepared to use a program like power point and spend the time to measure the paper to align it on the page yourself the software that comes with this package sure isnt going to do the job right 
has anyone else had this problem heres a new one i have recently bought two spindles of these discs and my computer imac w intel chip hardly outdated simply doesnt recognize them like i never put in a disc at all the kicker is that this spring i also ordered two spindles of these discs exactly the same as far as i can tell from which i burned one hundred discs not a single faulty one for a freind overseas i have no idea what the deal is but have a feeling that the issue is not the quality of the discs anyone got ideas 
please read this before you invest your cash in this product first off let me state for the record that i only buy sony but i have toadvise you against the purchase of the bean walkman i purchased one in march and returned it september as i had purchased replacementinsurance and was able to return it because it broke it is hard to turn off and the usb port cover always pops open not to mention the headphonesalways pull out the fm receiver is hard tune in the daylight as the screen is invisiable save your self the hassel 
when it worked the micro has some excellent features at the right price but it fails to work all the time first it was the firmware then it wouldn t connect to my pc now the hardware has failed i am going to buy an i pod despite apple s refusal to allow other forms of mp downloads 
not up to the task miserable tech support we had this printer less than months before the cartridge slider began to jam we would get an error message and then would have to reset the printer and reboot the computer to get it to work for a short while we finally ended up sending back the printer on their exchange program after i had to ask to speak to a supervisor the tech support wanted us to install a free ink cartridge when i had already installed several before contacting them we have had the replacement printer less than two months and are already experiencing problems again the ink cartridge is pooling ink under the cartridge rest area in a very heavy amount and the cartridge slider again has begun to jam tech support has had us clean the plastic tape that pulls the cartridge carrier back and forth and for now the unit is working we still haven t addressed the excessive ink leak which probably has something to do with the jamming problem i hope hp reviews comments on this website occasionally i would like them to know i have believed in their printers and used them successfully for years but my latest experience has caused me to reexamine that position also hp tech support is very difficult to deal with at best i talked to several overseas tech support reps that spoke almost unintelligible english i am one consumer willing to pay a little more for a product that is well supported hp are you listening 
man if they send it i could rate it its been weeeks already order soon to be on an first come first serve order and they go fast 
beware the shipping costs i thought this would be a great buy but the shipping costs make it more expensive than best buy screw that 
beware the line of products there is an entire series of these cameras produced by dlink which can be grouped into one product line this being the most expensive of the line would have the least reviews and exposure read about the others before buying i was just called to a new client site last week that has cameras installed of the half at any given time will drop off the network and or lock up he was continually calling his exiting tech guy who performed the install to reset them and eventually called me in because he wasn t getting in his own words what he paid for ive used netstumlber and a few other apps to verify the wireless network health which in my opinion is very good at the farthest point i am still receiving signal with a non enhanced linksys router other devices on his network are problem free the issues are isolated to the cameras short of recommending the client box them and send them back for a refund i ve emailed dlink for any opinions or aftermarket fixes they are running the latest firmware i ve tried to pick a few up on e bay to at least test them in a controlled environment but spending per camera when there are obvious problems would not be something i would be willing to invest in it would be something i would be interested in since if they do work as promised i could recommend them to future clients my credentials ex nypd officer and instructor ccnp ccdp cissp have a year networking business serving major brokerage houses in manhattan and have a smaller business auditing networks recommending network security and wireless solutions i will follow up if dlink provides an actual solution aim is my username above if anyone has jumped this hurdle followup days have passed and not a peep back from dlink tech support considering that the inquiry was for a total dlink purchase which was detailed in the e mail it would lead someone to believe that selling is important support is not i called their sales line and someone immediately picked up sorry ford motors in wouldn t have survived if their model t failed to start most of the time the cameras were boxed up and sent back i was able to pull a few down and place them in a controlled environment for testing of the i tested locked up within hours not a good score still they also are trying to get into the infrastructure market with hubs switches and larger corporate items i support over users on my main account and their line is one i can t recommend waiting for dlink not too confident they will get back to me 
sanrio should know better forget the terrible layout labeling and location of buttons forget the fact that the cover won t close if the mic stands are in place forget the lack of any type of anti skip technology the overall quality of the machine is ok i had a hard enough time finding a cd player that did not include a radio tuner and my daughter loves to sing so the karaoke is a nice bonus sanrio should be ashamed of selling this player without an ac adaptor there is alway a fair amount of batteries not included at christmas but a even your basic cd player includes a ac adaptor i now have to search the electronics store for a plug that will match so my daughters cars soundtrack doesn t drain my bank account and continue to fill the landfill with dead batteries 
doesn t seem to work to well well first off i m not sure if it s the card or the n router itself but ever since i installed the new n serious wireless in my home i have had nothing but problems and poor connectivity they clam that the n has extended range i went back to my pre n wireless and got twice the range and way better reliebility then with the n the concept seems good and the descriptions are great but i can t say i feel the product is what they say it is 
i am soooooooooo not impressed at first i was real happy with this but when i opened the case and started using it i realized how tiny this was i could hardly fit my usb cable into it s pouch and if you put the ipod in the case that it came with and then into the travel case it wouldn t really fit the hole thing started falling apart after a few days and my ipod wouldn t stop falling out of the little lether so it got scatched alot it s not really worth to me i suggest you do not buy it 
no vista compatibility do not buy this if you are planning on using windows vista there are no not even beta drivers and the windows xp drivers do not work m audio seems totally arrogant about the whole thing and there are no target dates for any driver support which hasn t even been confirmed 
no click did not work never clickedno tech supportwaste of good mone 
missing items too received my camera today and all items are not in the box i am missing hand strap ni mh batteries battery charger and cradle adapter worse part is i did receive a usb cable but it is not the right size and doesn t fit this is very frustrating how do i get the missing items 
useless for exercising the sennheiser pmx had excellent sound quality and volume compared with others i d used recently i had high hopes on first listen however these semi in ear headphones were moderately uncomfortable after only about minutes i later took them on a minute run the design is such that in any position i adjusted them the speakers tilted slightly upward in my ear once i started perspiring my sweat poured right into the little speakers i had to stop every few minutes to shake the collected sweat out of the earpieces the right speaker was filled with sweat and non functional pretty much the entire run who designed these consider these headphones only if you never plan to exercise while using them and will be keeping them on for minutes or less 
not compatible with my printer this product was not compatible with my hp laserjet there is no compatability list anywhere even though it s referenced in the manual this further reinforces my belief that belkin products are not worth the time money nor effort 
slide scanning very disappointing i purchase this product specifically to scan slides after a glowing review i had read no matter what i try the image quality is horrible curved lines are jagged and the image is grainy i have never had the patience to wait for the higher dpis for four slides at dpi the time frame is minutes dpi looks exactly like the color adjustments don t seem to make any difference either other functions seem ok 
woof the radio dials are not accessible when the radio is in the case i cut slits in the case with a knife to be able to tune the station and volume when in the case i can t believe the case didn t come this way and that s just the start of the problems the dials are fussy and it s not easy to carry this radio even in the case without nudging the dial to the point you must remove it from the case if you haven t cut any slits in it and re tune your station in minneapolis st paul wcco am radio comes in fine in a suburb miles from downtown but that station has howitzer power forget about tuning in virtually any other am station in the city granted i didn t buy this to listen to fm or shortwave it was to be an inexpensive radio to listen to baseball with the minnesota twins having moved from wcco that won t happen as this radio is incapable of pulling in the twins new am radio home or any othe am signal in the area that s really difficult to imagine being other radios i own even chintzy giveaway promotional radios can pull in most any station in the metro area if this is an example of grundig s work i d say they rely more on their brand name than their products 
don t waste your money these speakers in one word suck i made the mistake of buying them because they were so cheap i guess i forgot the old adage you get what you pay for didn t i they worked okay when i first installed them in a week i got bad signals and the speakers didn t work properly worse purchase i ve ever made ! dont make the same mistake i did please ! spend the extra money and get quality speakers 
constant problems especially with mac since we bought this to work with our mac we have had nothing but problems if asked to print one page of a document only it freaks out all the lights flash and has to be turned off an on again to reset it and calm it down ! have had long sessions with hp customer service on the phone and they haven t a clue if we could have been bothered we would have taken it back but just live with the fact that we have to print excess pages at least we do recycle there are various other things that also cause it to freak and flash can never work out specifically what we just sigh and reset it will be looking for something else to upgrade to soon 
very limited life i bought the ear buds to replace the ones that came with my ipod i used it for about fifteen minutes and then the left earbud would not transmit any sound sending these ones back i must say that the earbuds kept outside sound out very well much to my mom s dismay she couldn t fuss at me p oh well 
thanks to amazon ! no thanks to coby this player has garnered decent reviews so i thought i d try it the first unit sent to me was unusable because of skipping i had purchased the extended warranty but amazon s extended warranty defers to coby s warranty for the first year so you have to deal with coby directly i found that one could hardly ever get through to coby and when i did they had to consult and call me back so i ended up having to try to get through three different times only to be told i d have to pay to ship the bad unit back to them which would cost almost as much as the unit thank goodness for amazon when i called to express my discontent the amazon customer relations staffer quicly and easily sent me another unit thank you because the second one works without skipping it sounds okay it does the basics there is no resume play function however which is annoying 
a waste of money i bought the wintv tuner to use primarily as a video capture card frankly i believe using a computer as a tv monitor is a waste of a good computer i intended to use the wintv pvr to convert video tapes into digital format but when attempting conversions the computer freezes up i have lots of ram and plenty of room on my hard drive the longest capture i have managed so far is minutes but most range in size from one minute to six minutes after spending a day splicing together the fragments of a vhs tape i converted with the and which i then burned to dvd i discovered the quality of the image far below dvd quality it is far below video tape quality i am willing to spend some real money on a good video capture card but it isn t the wintv it s not useful as a capture card and it s too small to be a doorstop 
sony should stick to tvs these speakers are big in size but short on performance except for the price tag not much else excites one about them they make a good surround sound system with the sony speaker set for surround sound but for listening to music you are better off with a set of good bookshelf speakers with a decent sub these speakers lack bass inspite of their size and sound quality is poor at higher volumes 
manufacturer s defect the cd changer would not open to receive the cd s a call to the company s customer service resulted in their decision that it must be a manufacture s defect so it was returned to the supplier for a replacement the replacement is in progress attention from the supplier has been satisfactoty 
bad choice i bought this mp player because it was just a few bucks cheaper than the ipod and i ended up paying dearly for it it is a piece of junk that stopped working only after a couple months the firmware decided to stop recognizing songs albums titles and eventually that there was even any music to listen to now i have a dollar mp player with no music on it that will not interface with my pc customer service don t count on it so if your into extensively troubleshooting highly frustrating pieces of junk this is a great product 
i can t believe they are actually selling this terrible product i bought an airplay from am apple store for around other than the fact that blank fm stations are hard to find in the new york metropolitan area and that you need to keep changing to different blank stations as you drive the product itself is simply terrible even if you are in a parking lot and find a blank fm station the quality of the music the airplay broadcasts is very bad the bass is almost non existent and there is a constant hiss in the background that you cannot get rid of this product is not worth buying especially for 
don t use it in your basement this thing worked fine for about nine months and then died it doesn t like humidity i keep my switch and router in my basement like many basements it s a bit damp though i have a dehumidifier running all the time it s not that damp in there but the switch just died on me id question the power supply or some other factor but my router and dsl modem have never had any problems at all and this is the second netgear switch i ve owned that has gone kaput my best guess is dampness 
cheap price cheap quality this elgin remake of the original timex t is nothing like the original i like the original so much i was hoping to buy another sadly the quality of this clock is very very poor this new design of the t is completely different worse they should have changed the part number i liked the ability to quickly and quietly set a nap time in the original no more ! the updated version is much more difficult to set and it beeps loudly every time you press a button i am very disappointed i d gladly pay three times the price to get a t of the original timex design 
a sure to star rating i had hoped for more trusting to insightful reviewers here i purchased a grundig ga with a few clicks i supposed that my dad s grundig of the s wouldn t be dupiclated in a ga but all i wanted was quality reception and a nice sound my radio provides neither yes it s a nicely finished set and all it s options work that s about the best of it my night stand holds a sony clock radio that puts the grundig s reception and sound quality to shame a standby battery operated radio is a must in south florida and this set will do that job nicely i had hoped for more 
radio reception stinks period as others have written in their reviews the radio reception on this is simply horrible the manual and their website suggest extending the power cord to improve reception however nothing we did made it tolerable to listen any station on the dial the static and noise were simply not acceptable we have three or four other radios in the house that all pull in the stations just fine so it must be this unit we picked it up for at target and even at that price it s not worth it we re returning the item 
poor quality control bought various capacity lenmar aas mah mah mah and the only consistent thing about them is their inconsistent quality control probably are doa and never will accept a charge despite using various chargers including a maha mhc which has a rejeuvenation and diagnostic function and shows them as nonfunctional another leak and fail prematurely then the rest work ok but just ok i ve had better success with other brands 
not very durable i purchased one of these just shy of three years ago feb i have taken very good care of it it stays in a pocket in my briefcase when not in use and used it several times a week while i teach over time the silver finish wore off around the on button apparently from perspiration from my hand exposing the copper underneath last week the button froze in the on position so it is now effectively useless the laser diode still works however also the company offers geek points for future purchases that are supposed to be good for months i checked the site earlier this week and while it s now only been months the ones i earned from this purchase are no longer on record 
there are better wrist rests the seam came apart and the gel leaked out in the first months the non skid underside surface has a peculiar and distinctly unpleasant smell 
works almost i am using this thing with a toshiba laptop and a microsoft mouse and keyboard it installed as advertised and seemed great until generation of random mouse clicks seems to do this in all programs and it is very annoying imaging editing in word and having the cursor jump to the mouse cursor location or just having random right clicks synchronization and random behavior of the cap s lock cap s lock turns off and on randomly and then will not sychronize with the laptop keyboard the only remedy i have found is a reboot maybe i got a lemon but based on other review on other sites i cannot recommend this device 
think about it this appears to be a great product however i haven t had mine long enough to find out this will be the second time i have had to send it back because of a faulty fm modulator at a trip electronica wants it back in days and the bill to send it there is on you any savings you might get from ordering online is eaten up fairly quickly if you require an fm modulator for your vehicle i would recommend purchasing local so that you can return it without the hassle and price 
falls out gets lost i was happy with my original stylus but the replacement does not fit snugly inside the silo turning the pda upside down causes the stylus to fall out i ve dropped the stylus six times in only two days it s only a matter of time until i lose it i am a very unhappy customer and will seek some other replacement pen ps my pda was replaced by palm and may be defective i cannot be certain that the problem i cite above is due to the stylus rather than the pda itself 
acadaptor for cobra i ordered the unit twice and twice i received a carrying case not the adapter i returned both and ordered direct from cobra when i had called customer support for amazon the second time i got connected to india of course and was informed that a lot of their codes are wrong i guess they are trained to agree with anything the customer says 
customer service disappears adapter advertised to work with magellan t but is the wrong adapter not sure who is at fault but amazon has not responded 
ok not great i ve had the phone for about a week now including the optional bluetooth mobile phone link pros stylish than most build sound quality cons when using the base speakerphone and you pick up the handset from the base it does not switch to the handset major annoyance buttons are little stiff maybe i was just used to my previous setup my previous setup was a panasonic kx tcb line mhz dss speakerphone the motorola was supposed replace my panasonic but i think not too bad i do like the stylish design the optional bluetooth link 
terrible beware pros uses less batteries than the space shuttle aas great idea gone to h quickly due to lack of product support ! apparently the person in charge of designing and marketing tapes for these units suffers from attention deficit disorder and is totally unable to remotely consider any meaningful complete line of tapes red blue white pearl paper yellow smiley faces green metalic black on clear but no white on clear there appears to be little if any hope for those who might actually like to color code products in any single medium plastic paper polyester metallic etc just whatever come to the designer s head is what s released five types here two there one over here no rhyme nor reason dymo has done themselves no favors here 
p os i know that everyone else seems to love this so perhaps my complaint is more about apple in general my ipod mini pinkis a lemon the battery has never worked properly it takes longer to charge than to discharge and my current playing time per charge no changing settings not backlighting nothing but hitting play and waiting till the battery dies is about hours apple will gladly sell me a new battery but other than that tough it is apparently my fault thet they re selling shoddy products i m not saying don t buy it there aren t realistically any better choices out there than the ipod but buy it when you have a week to sit around and evaluate it and when they get around to opening a store near you as for me i think i m going to dig out my old discman 
buyer beware don t buy this product it has been nothing but trouble it will reinstall it s driver every time you reboot which will cause conflicts you will be like wtf also the hardware will only work when connected to the usb port you originally used the installation disk with i hate this piece of junk and will replace it asap perhaps there is something i am ignorant of in terms of networking but i don t expect to have an msce to use a simple nic this product is flaky at best 
you get what you pay for basically this is a cheap item that should not be purchased you can spend a little more and get a nicer and better equipped item i bought this for my young daughter to download only minimal amounts of music so i thought for the price this would be fine however it simply would not download songs it continually locked up when it would finally download the ear piece had static throughout finally upon downloading one cd you were forced to erase that cd to download another i have sent this back to the manufacturer for a refund upon telling the salesperson about my reasoning for returning the product there was no questions this is probably commonplace for this product 
want to protect your ipod get something else i just put this on minutes ago and i don t like it like some other reviews i couldn t get out many of the air bubbles of them after putting it on this is bad since two are on my video screen and many are on the click wheel and the back only covers a modest portion the about from another reviewer suggestion seems about right you also have to be very careful putting it on the only reason i even tried it out was because it was a gift from one of my coworkers and she got them cheap in a packto add insult to injury the overlay is actually harder to clean than the ipod by itself it has fingerprint marks all over it usually fixed by a wipe with a clean cloth i ll probably be taking this protector off relatively soon shame on belkin for selling this product if you want to protect your ipod get something else that will protect it from impact as well i have a slight chip less than mm on mine on the front side after dropping it it slipped out of my hand onto a concrete corner from about feet i figure that s pretty good protection on apple s part but that may have been avoided with a durable case if you re going to get something go for all around protection and not this 
product has bugs customer service won t help i purchased the gb creative zen v plus player during the first week in february i am returning it and this is why the package arrived from amazon i loaded up the software on my computer then hooked up the player through the usb cord i let it charge for hours like the instructions state then i proceeded to load some of my music onto the player so after the music was loaded i disconnected the player from the usb cable and started to listen to the music the sound quality was good the player is easy to navigate in the menus etc the problem was about half the music i uploaded was not on the player i could see the folder and menu option for the artist or genre but the actual file was not there so i plugged the player back into the usb cord and pulled up the file location on the player through the computer the file was there and i could play it just fine through windows media player i tried to access it again through the player and it was not there then i accessed through the computer just fine all my songs all of them are in mp format from kps for my audio books to kps for the songs i ripped from cd s the player just wouldn t read about half my songs there was really no rhyme or reason on whish songs it would recognize i would load an entire album of songs and i could only play or tracks this happened with my entire music collection so i thought maybe the firmware was out of date so i uploaded all the updates from creative which did include a firmware update it did not solve the problem i then uploaded some of the same songs that would not play on the zen v plus onto my year old rio and original ipod shuffle and they played just fine i was frustrated at this point so i called the creative customer service it is strange because they do not post the number for there company anywhere on there website and now i understand why they have the worst customer service tech department of any computer electronic company i have ever spoke with after three calls never speaking to someone who i could fully understand as english was definitely not a first language more like a rd or th language i arrived nowhere they kept telling me they were emailing document to me on how to resolve the problem no email ever came checked the junk folder and every other possible place so i tried a fourth call this guy basically called me stupid from what i could understand saying i can t believe you americans and then mumbled something in another language i asked for a supervisor he told me that he would escalate my call and someone would call me in days then he hung up i was really amazed that a company would treat its customers in this nature they really have to respect for there customers and do not want to help them in any way so i am returning the creative zen v plus player and i also don t plan on buying anything from creative again by the way after all this the problem never was fixed also when doing research on this product i came across a couple articles and reviews that stated this player would play divx files this is not true this player will not play any files without being converted first i took an avi video that was mb and it converted it into a gb file the format they use is absolutely a waste of space if you want to upload an entire movie on mpeg or avi format it will end up taking the entire gb of space if not more i converted the movie cars for my son on a short road trip thinking i could have my music plus his movie i was wrong the movie took up gb after being converted i would not recommend this product to anyone as much as i don t like the ipod i would recommend it over the zen v plus because it plays all my music they have a customer service tech support that helps you and cares about its customers i hope this helps anyone looking at this player jeff 
good quality not so good software or sheet feeder was truly impressed by the quality of the pictures was less impresed by the software in the printer to manage pictures and print a bit confusing and slow the ultimate disappointment was seeing how at times the paper gets jammed which makes you lose precious ink and paper altogether i don t think i would recommend it 
didn t work for dell m i bought one of these modules for my dell m installed it easily but once every few days my system crashes or i get a blue screen i contacted kingston and they said that this module hasn t been tested on dell machines and is configured to work on generic computers only ! i wouldn t recommend this memory for dell m users 
weak midrange worse bass i puchased the ls s to get a decent speaker for a great price i was disappointed i knew the bass response would not be astonding but it was almost non existant the midrange and the highs are scratchy i would not recommend the speakers for anything other than talk radio 
harddrive crash after days other reviews same problem player only says harddrive problem worked fine for days then crashed now being charged to have it looked at by creative labs since it is after days it s says year warranty but after you have to pay to get it fixed still cheap tech support took over hrs to reply and when they did they try to sell you stuff for a broken player this is in the tech email please be patient and we ll figure this out in the meantime feel free to visit our website and see the entire line of accessories that we have for the zen vision m they will definitely help you get the most of your music experience here is the link the only thing the zen has going for it and why stars is the picture is nice and clear will not buy any creative labs again this is the rd product the others being speakers all have broken or poorly manufactured i have had better luck with lower end products 
where s the display again i loved the atomic aspect of this clock in addition to the travel amenities but the first time i used it i swear it was impossible to see the display once it was dark even with the display lighted there was one exception to this if i tilted the clock until it was almost closed if it was at that angle i could finally read the display i m surprised this little thing made it out of their testing facilities with this display problem i have perfect vision and still couldn t see it for the life of me now i m in search of a different product once again my advice is to not waste your time here as nice as it sounds 
horrible customer service the service from this vendor is horrible my account was charged in may of this year and as of have not received anything first they said they need to make a model change i was fine with the model change but never got the product i sent many notes to nicholas nasti but he has been unable to fix the problem recently i have been unable to contact them with notes or telephone 
awful clock radio alarm does not work manufacturer does not list telephone number apparently customer service does not exis 
a surprising disappointment from a usually stellar company i m a seasoned graphics pro who always reads the manuai and have owned several previous models of wacom tablet for the life of me i just couldn t get the graphire working on my mac at all the installer crashed kernal panic my otherwise rock solid tiger installation downloading the latest driver from wacom s web site was only marginally useful the cursor jittered like crazy no matter how i adjusted the control panel and even moderately fast motion caused it to submarine from one side of the screen to the other wacom s sparse faq suggested that interference from my monitor might have been the culprit and could be remedied by moving the tablet further away it didn t work and besides i have no plans use the tablet from across the room phone support was no better wacom very thoughtfully gave its staff july rd off ! too bad it would have been a chance to talk me in to keeping it looks like my trusty workhorse intuos tablet will be enjoying a few more years of service if this is the level to which wacom s legendary tech support has fallen 
very missleadingly named cable i finally realize why they don t include this with the pro sling box because the value it adds is practically the resulting picture is actually worse than the component output i have an hd cable box that outputs converted signals and downsampled picture was actually better than the straight resampled hd signal that this cable outputs the picture is small and it is not noticably better than the component output in hindsight the pro box is really not necessary since the hd cable does not add its advertised value 
very flaky contrary to viking s reputation for quality i ve owned various viking branded memory cards in the past and have always been pleased with their performance until i purchased this gb compactflash card its possible that this card works well in other uses but i found its performance unacceptable as storage for raw images shot with my canon digital rebel slr anywhere from to of the images were corrupted particularly bad in continuous shooting mode contrast with my lexar media mb and gb cards which were able to shoot reliably with no corrupt images under the same conditions and without as much of a lag time as the viking card often left waiting seconds after shooting as few as continuous images while the card to recovers 
company sucks ii bought one of these devices so i could record guitar through my computer i set it up according to the instructions but get no sound out the led on the device and the vu s on the software interface say it s working but it will not output to the sound card so i wrote m audio and asked for their help their answer was that since i was operating xp media center edition operating system it will not support two sound devices and they could not help me unless i get another version of xp they could not help me at all they basically told me to bug off because i m using xp mce nowhere on the box does it say that it is not compatible with xp mce in fact it just says the minimum requirement is xp with service pack period to me that is false advertising i tried to take it back where i bought it but they would not take it because it has software and i of course opened and installed it ! so then i was stuck with a useless box i finally did get it to work sort of i took the line output from the box and plugged it into the line input of my sound card however it has no fidelity sounds terrible and the sound effects software that came with the box will not work one other note when i tried to take it back to the music store and told them i was using xp media center edition the guy laughed and waved his arm at the wall of sound devices and said that none of them will work with xp media center edition ! he says it is really a licensing issue with microsoft then i found out you cannot upgrade mce to xp professional ! thanks to microsoft i would have to wipe out my hard drive and do a clean install if i want to put xp pro on my system ! this just keeps getting better and better ! 
didnt travel well while traveling in china i hooked up this charger to a sharper image voltage converter and had to through it away after it started smoking a much better buy would be the sony charger with worldwide voltage and for dollars less 
thimble another typical ink jet consumable very small runs out fast and costs way too much just will have to wait for the rd party knock off to come on the market 
buyer beware of version number i purchased this software from ant online on this is not the current version of mapsend this is version of the software magellan customer service has confirmed that version is the current version do not be fooled by the product id ending in a it is version and you cannot tell until you open the box and take the shrink wrap off of the cd case of course once you open the box you cannot return it to replace it with ver sure the price is good compared to other places but you are buying old software and there is nothin on amazon to indicate that it is old 
junk i read another review on here complaining about the sticky buttons on the audio source eq after reading another review saying their unit worked fine with no button problems i decided to take a chance hoping that the other reviewer s button problem was an isolated incident wishful thinking i ve had the eq for about a week and the same problem showed up on mine i was listening to an old album on my turntable when one of the stereo channels just cut out at first i thought it might be a loose cable or worse a problem with the cartridge on my turntable then i remembered the review about the sticky buttons sure enough i went to the eq and jiggled the buttons and the sound cut in and out as i did so after jiggling them a few times the problem went away for a while then it out of nowhere started acting up again it s not so much that they stick as it is that they just plain don t work properly the have a cheap feel to them all the switches appear to be mounted to a single flimsy bracket when you press one switch you can see the adjacent ones move besides the fact they don t work they are confusing and limited the way they are formatted they don t let you monitor the tape deck s output when recording something that should be a standard feature of an eq the buttons on my old radio shack optimus eq made a lot more sense in how they operated for dubbing monitoring there are a couple other annoyances on the audio source too the analyzer display has no sensitivity adjustment when i play my cd player the display is just maxed out you can adjust the display by turning down the input level knobs but i only want to turn down the display not the volume ! the line on the eq should be a different color for easily identifying the relative position of the sliders but it is simply white like all the lines which makes it difficult to easily identify the center line if i were keeping the unit i would take care of this problem with a magic marker there are also no scale markings on the input level control knobs leaving you to guess as to when you have the left and right balanced the sound quality seems decent when it works but what good is a stereo component if the sound cuts out while you re listening to your music the illuminated sliders and spectrum analyzer look neat but hey i don t buy a stereo component just for looks seeing as other people have complained of the same button issue i m sure audio source has to be aware of the problem obviously they are not going to invest the resources to correct the problem on something as obsolete as a graphic equalizer it s too bad since this model seems to be pretty much the only eq left on the market for a home stereo the only other eq i found other than professional models for rack mount systems was a teac model which doesn t have as many inputs as the audio source i am returning the audio source for a full refund no sense having them send me another one when undoubtedly it will have the same defect i guess i will try my luck with the teac either that or put up with the muddy sound my stereo has without an eq i will just have to do the old cable swapping routine if i want to do any dubbing with the teac 
maybe i m just unlucky but mine was a dud i bought mine when they first came out and at its most expensive cost i got to charge my ipod times and the charger completely died on me i bought another from a different brand used and under on top of it and have had no problems whatsoever and i use it frequently i was very dissatisfied and unimpressed with this griffin model 
nice small but extremely fragile i own the gb version of this drive it is tiny but still fits nicely into a usb port but i have noticed a serious problem the flash stick itself is actually smaller than the casing it is in you can see it on the bottom i have been very careful with how i store my super stick and careful in inserting and removing it from usb ports regardless the plastic shell around the memory stick is breaking across the width at the top and the bottom corners of the plastic shell that go into a usb port have started snapping off in little chunks 
will not work with dell inspiron laptops i previously purchased a siig firewire expresscard after several weeks with siig tech support i m told it is a known issue that card won t work with dell laptops so i phoned belkin techsupport before buying this card they tell me they know of no such problems well card gives exact same problem as siig ! works fine on firewire but the minute you use b firewire drivers my dell inspiron bluescreens and reboots ! emailed and phoned belkin tech support but no response solution from my experience dell inspiron es can t support firewire update after almost months of trying to get a resolution from belkin they advise their product development team is still working on the problem would i recommend buying a belkin product no way that level of customer service is a disgrace 
does not fit explorist xl title says it all returned it there was not caveat with respect to the xl although did come across some other sites that highlighted the fact 
waste of time i used this reader for a week before it stopped working it worked ok for the week that it worked at all it would not read xd cards though it did not detect that a card was inserted at all i tried inserting the card fully partially and even tried jiggling it a little it seemed like the contacts on the card were touching the contacts on the reader but it would not recognize that a card was inserted it did however work with my compact flash card then inexplicably it stopped functioning entirely i unplugged it and plugged it back in and scanned for hardware changes in device manager but the card was dead i tried plugging it into another computer and it was not detected at all lexar support left a lot to be desired i explained the problem in detail and the response i got was a generic try restarting the computer etc etc then they wanted me to pay for shipping to rma their defective merchandise i sent it back to amazon instead and got my money back i m willing to assume that i just got a lemon but the piss poor tech support convinced me to get a refund rather than a replacement 
these sound terrible bottom of the list in independent tests consumer reports placed these at the bottom of the list of one of their recent center channel speaker comparisons and i could not agree more lower costing speakers performed far better in some calculated tests of my own i found these had far less range and presence than other major brand speakers i have a yamaha ns c speaker that provides full lifelike sound and handles plenty of power this bose center channel speaker was a major disappointment and far from representative of their generally outstanding audio components 
what a disappointment this product has the potential to be tremendous but due to poor packaging design the inside of the plastic was scratched that absolutely ruins the ipod video experience now that there is lcd glare exposing all the scratches also there is a big rhigoskin logo on the front which makes the case even that more distracting im sure that it isn t polycarbonate because it scratches with my fingernail what a letdown ps if you are buying the gb version of this case it will double the thickness of your setup 
do not buy i received the router and tried to install it i got up to the point where the router was to verify the connection and i lost my internet connection i then found out that it deleted my ip address called belkin tech support with a sad result bottom line is that i lost my ip address times had to go to my server to restore it each time belkin tech support needs to be recycled talked to repres with no success will return this junk in a new box 
causes windows blue screen of death despite the rave reviews for this product i m a bit more skeptical i recently purchased an hp laserjet mfc and wanted to use this device to connect to our office network a couple of thoughts toms networking does a comparison between this product and silex s slx sxu i would strongly suggest anyone thinking about buying this product to read the article the article can be found at although silex s product only has one usb port you can connect a usb hub to support up to devices the keyspan device supports devices but you cannot add more devices i found that the unit would experience problems if i submitted a print job greater than mb through the keyspan i reset the printer and nothing got fixed only when i power cycled the keyspan did things work i am using the latest version v which also upgrades the keyspan firmware toms hardware also reports that it would crash with several different devices i read on other web sites that the keyspan software causes the blue screenofdeath irqlessthanequal errors so i tend to believe that the problem is caused more by the keyspan drivers than the hp ones in some parts of its web site keyspan advertises that this unit supports usb v but if you read the fine print it s supporting at usb v speeds i discussed with keyspan about connecting external hard drives this unit is really meant for multi function printers and cannot support external hd s i decided to return this product and try out the silex instead although there is a lot of potential for this device i would not suggest it for enterprise environments i read the glowing amazon reviews but would put more skepticism about their comments now that i have tried it for myself i will update this review later when i have a chance to try the silex unit 
poorly constructed space and pockets are great but it s not at all durable my first pack ripped out a seam on my first trip using it i returned it hoping it was just a defect the replacement lasted a couple months i ll return this one too but not for another wenger 
dvd operation is very poor while the price for this hts is very nice the performance is substandard there s a hissing sound when the unit is off the dvd player has trouble playing dvds i have a large dvd collection most of them don t play the surround quality is also very poor it s a stretch to call it surround sound when half of the speakers don t put out much sound in order to get this serviced i have to send it out for up to months i bought a progressive dvd player put the audio through the phillips hts and the video to the tv and suddenly the picture was better and the sound was better 
good quality but get the data power cable the quality of this cable is fine but it doesn t give you access to the power pins that are in the garmin interface get the cable that does power and data instead or if you re a hardware geek then make your own with the stuff from purple open projects pfranccom 
not for home use my wife and i have a small business and we bought one to use at the office it seemed to work fine there i don t believe i upgrated the firmware at our office and i decided to get one of the same for our home as well thinking that would make setting up a vpn easy i did upgrade the firmware at home our home network has all kinds of internet connectivity problems now these problems don t really manifest themselves when using the web but when we get all kinds of disconnect problems when we try to do large downloads use our vonage phone play online games or access online streaming content like music or videos i believe the router is closing our ports and not delivering packets like it should this product should be avoided and if you do get it don t upgrade the firmware to i m online now to get a different router for our home shame on linksys 
product has bugs customer service won t help i purchased the gb creative zen v plus player during the first week in february i am returning it and this is why the package arrived from amazon i loaded up the software on my computer then hooked up the player through the usb cord i let it charge for hours like the instructions state then i proceeded to load some of my music onto the player so after the music was loaded i disconnected the player from the usb cable and started to listen to the music the sound quality was good the player is easy to navigate in the menus etc the problem was about half the music i uploaded was not on the player i could see the folder and menu option for the artist or genre but the actual file was not there so i plugged the player back into the usb cord and pulled up the file location on the player through the computer the file was there and i could play it just fine through windows media player i tried to access it again through the player and it was not there then i accessed through the computer just fine all my songs all of them are in mp format from kps for my audio books to kps for the songs i ripped from cd s the player just wouldn t read about half my songs there was really no rhyme or reason on whish songs it would recognize i would load an entire album of songs and i could only play or tracks this happened with my entire music collection so i thought maybe the firmware was out of date so i uploaded all the updates from creative which did include a firmware update it did not solve the problem i then uploaded some of the same songs that would not play on the zen v plus onto my year old rio and original ipod shuffle and they played just fine i was frustrated at this point so i called the creative customer service it is strange because they do not post the number for there company anywhere on there website and now i understand why they have the worst customer service tech department of any computer electronic company i have ever spoke with after three calls never speaking to someone who i could fully understand as english was definitely not a first language more like a rd or th language i arrived nowhere they kept telling me they were emailing document to me on how to resolve the problem no email ever came checked the junk folder and every other possible place so i tried a fourth call this guy basically called me stupid from what i could understand saying i can t believe you americans and then mumbled something in another language i asked for a supervisor he told me that he would escalate my call and someone would call me in days then he hung up i was really amazed that a company would treat its customers in this nature they really have to respect for there customers and do not want to help them in any way so i am returning the creative zen v plus player and i also don t plan on buying anything from creative again by the way after all this the problem never was fixed also when doing research on this product i came across a couple articles and reviews that stated this player would play divx files this is not true this player will not play any files without being converted first i took an avi video that was mb and it converted it into a gb file the format they use is absolutely a waste of space if you want to upload an entire movie on mpeg or avi format it will end up taking the entire gb of space if not more i converted the movie cars for my son on a short road trip thinking i could have my music plus his movie i was wrong the movie took up gb after being converted i would not recommend this product to anyone as much as i don t like the ipod i would recommend it over the zen v plus because it plays all my music they have a customer service tech support that helps you and cares about its customers i hope this helps anyone looking at this player jeff 
didn t work for me i spent hours trying to get this to work and i am pretty good with computers spent hours on the phone with linksys and finally got someone who said if my wireless router isnt linksys it probably wont work i bought this to use with my multifunction printer will return 
not ready for primetime purchased to do a full backup of my hard drive seemed to install just fine but backup procedure produces nothing but error messages wish i had tried the trial version first don t buy this until you know for sure it will work with your system 
meh ! shiny but uncomfortable and unpractical i bought this mouse hoping to use it with my new hp dv laptop with internal bluetooth i was excited about the instant view feature and the lazer percision however when i got the mouse connected it worked but no instant viewer turns out the instant viewer only works if you have the dongle pluged in but the reason i bought a bluetooth mouse was in order to avoid a dongle breaking off in the side of my laptop on top of all this the extra two buttons on the sides are awkwerd to press i have to contort my fingers in a arthritus inducing cramp to press them nothing like my old microsoft mouses cozy side button the middel mouse button also is annoyingly resistant to press in order to activate mouse button three which is set to activate the amazing instant viewer which is decent but useless without the dongle as far as lazer percision not too noticable my kingston rf lazer mouse seemed to preform better the only reason i gave it a is the charger is nice the battery is good and it has a nice brushed aluminum finish which feels nice and cool against the palm this makes a decent desktop mouse if you use the dongle which they include the connectivity is good and the percision is nice not something i d recomend for a laptop user for the price overall subpar 
great product ! for two days when this adapter first arrived i thought it was great the sound quality was excellent and free of all the distortion and interference i get from using an fm transmitter style adapter there are few open frequencies in the sf bay area the first day i used it for about minutes total didnt have far to drive and it worked great the second day i had a bit farther to drive after about minutes it quit hasn t worked again since i didn t expect it to last forever but less than an hour yes it has a year warranty just send the unit back with a money order to cover the return postage of course then you re spending more in postage than you originally spent for the unit 
shortcoming only cons defect the backlight does not work shortcoming has palm os an early version for handspring visors neutralexpedited shipping time dayspros priceps vendor customer support contacted me and provided a replacement unit with a working backlight free of additional charge 
buyer beware i bought this tv to use during lunch breaks at work and to take to football games it couldn t pickup any vhf channels and could only pickup the same uhf channels the next day i shipped it back for a refund 
beware camera dies after fireware upgrade camera died after firmware upgrade using the ethernet port to perform upgrade as dlink recommends i bought from ebay new and dlink refused to replace or repair so beware if you pay several hundred dollars make sure you buy it from a authorized dealer or dlink want work on it or even attempt to help you get it repaired think twice about buying dlink because down the road you may have to throw it away regardless of the price you paid need to research other brands and see what their repair policy is after warranty from unauthorized seller or buying used 
found a way to fix this phone i read most of the reviews of this phone and agree with them i would never buy another ge phone in fact i am waiting for my new uniden cordless phone to arrive from amazon in the meantime i tried this experiment yesterday i took the battery out of the phone then sprayed the keys and talk button in front with orange power i really doused it good after that i blasted the phone with steaming hot water so much so that the screen fogged up now after that i shook the excess water out and duct taped the phone to a fan with the buttons facing the fan today i hooked the battery back up put everything back together and tried it it worked fine even without a charge i didn t have to keep pressing the same number times to get it to register it worked similar to when it was new ive done this with stereo receivers by taking the cover off putting them in the bathtub squirting them with a spray cleaner and blasting them with a hot shower then i put them in between two fans for three days after that they work fine i m sure i m not the first person to do this just make sure you don t have the unit plugged in when you do this or you ll get shocking results try it ! what have you got to lose 
bad design bad product i got one of these w my shuffle dont waste your money horrible design with the velco in the back against your skin if you do work up a good sweat running the moisture will seep right through and soak your shuffle the velcro at the top and bottom seams is woefully inadequate my shuffle died after only months b c the repeated exposure to moisture sweat via running did it in and the earplug access is um a challenge as best keep looking 
decent sound but zero comfort i bought this headset from retailer offline and returned it the next day first off i have to make it clear that i had no problems with sound even though the speakers could have been just a tiny bit bigger they use mm drivers the sound quality of the headset was just fine however when it comes to wearing these headphones the only words that come to mind are uncomfortable as sin the awkward squarish shape of the cups made it hard to get any kind of decent seal around the ears and a bad seal on closed back headphones ultimately leads to poor sound isolation also i have no idea what material they used for the cup pads but it is nowhere near soft enough in fact i litterally couldn t wear these things for more than five minutes without my ears turning red flush from discomfort mind you i also own a cheap pair of koss headphones i can keep on for hours at a time so my ears are definitely no stranger to being cupped in speakers either but these things they just plain hurt to wear after a very short period of time which isn t good at all discomfort and being unable to obtain a good seal around the ears were ultimately the main reasons for the return if your ears are tough you should have no problem with this headset the sound quality is decent and it should work just fine for you however if you re looking for comfort and good sound isolation you ll want to look elsewhere 
missing cable never got a chance to try out the drive because it was missing an interconnect when i tried western digital support i was kept waiting for minutes and hung up i returned the item and would avoid the brand in future 
do not buy this camera my g died as soon as i applied the latest firmware i had first tried the g and it froze up constantly lost its wireless grip didn t return reliably to location settings all in all a great concept but d link doesn t deliver no tech support don t waste your time with these cameras i had to return both the g and g to amazon 
it is in the shop every thing works well enough with the exception of the hdmi terminals that were not functional correctely as i recieved the sharp aquos lcdu lcd hdtv the picture blinks on and off when i used either of the two hdmi terminals for input from my direct tv hd receiver toke some effort to get sharp arrange warrenty repair it is still in the shorp hopefully it will get fixed soon aother feature that is missing from this tv is the option of elimating weak stations ater auto tune 
synchronization tool not a hard drive i purchased this item thinking that i could manipulate files and make room on my laptop hard drive by transferring them to the portable but this product will not accomplish that it allows you to share the same files between two computers but will not allow you to view the files move them or have files stored on the portable without having them on your pc maclaptop there was no indication of this synchronization process on the package or inserts i needed to search the wd website to learn what this item is intended for the website emphatically tells you to not use this to back up your files i have not doubt that you use it to synchronize files it will work well 
not for me this case is too large for general carrying of a dvd player there were too many velcro straps included without instructions or ideas on how to use them pictures were on the package however i couldn t figure most of them out 
big red flag don t waste your money syntax tests at your cost it will work only until about one year for which there is a warranty after that it all depends on your luck mine stopped working at th month took it to a local repair shop low quality and unavailable parts so repair was not possible except by syntax they ask for an arm and a leg to fix it on top of shipping this heavy junk you are better off buying a well known brand with extended warranty 
don t buy if near us canada border this gps comes with us map on the sd card and canada map on the included cd but never the twain shall meet by car i m a few hours from canada and several days from the eastern us but i can t swap out the faraway eastern us part of the map on the tomtom go for a nearby canadian map it s either all canada or all contiguous us this is a major functional flaw if you live near the us canada border or live further away and like to take cross border trips oh and if you do decide to swap out the us map be sure to save it on your computer first tomtom doesn t bother to provide a backup on the cd so if you don t first make your own backup before changing to the canadian map you can t later get the us map back

easy to use but unreliable we bought this phone two years ago while the phone is pretty easy to use and has nice features ive especially enjoyed the handsfree function on the handsets we ve found it to be extremely unreliable the problems we ve had are listed below very short battery life for the handsets the screen on one of our handsets blanked out after only several months of use the handsets go out of range when one takes them only a modest distance from the base even though we have the base in the middle of our house the handsets don t work at the ends and our house is not that big the handsets randomly become unregistered from the base and have to be reset this has only become a problem in the past month the issues we ve had with this phone have frustrated us so much that we are now shopping for a new phone usually we d expect such a purchase to last longer than two years 
can t do math obviously amazon thinks that it s customers can read but not do math ! this is the most inane offer yet ! 
ordered two one broken yes it s cheap that doesn t mean it s worth buying i ordered two of these one seems to work fine the other only had one working earpiece i had to send it back for a replacement pain in the but and i have to hope the replacement doesn t fail too dave says be forewarned 
terrible case broke my ipod don t buy this case before reading this message this is a terrible waterproof case i used it once and for minutes only i took it for my swimming lesson and in less than minutes it drowned my ipod nano i complained at the otterbox web site but they didn t bother to answer me don t buy this item you will be waisting your money 
on off it is the year the st century we ve put men on the moon we ve launched space probes to the edges of our solar system we can even remotely drive little vehicles along the surfaces of other planets but we can t design a simply on off button the on off button for the blue logger is one of the most insanely stupid things i ve ever encountered some mentally challenged engineer somewhere decided that you have to hold the button seconds to turn it on and seconds to turn it off it doesn t sound that difficult to do but in practice it is infuriating especially when you are trying to turn it on but end up turning it off right now the blue logger is sitting in front of me and i cannot turn it off it simply will not turn off oh and i ve had lots of problems connecting it to my bluetooth adapter and have yet to get street atlas usa to recognize it 
don t buy this for home use this clock looks good and has a nice feature set but while it may make a nice travel clock if your cell phone won t do it s really not suitable for regular use while the time is displayed in nice large numbers the contrast is low and the display is hard to read in all but the brightest light the display is set comparatively deep within the bezel and tends to chop off the right side of the last seconds digit unless you view it fairly straight on the date and temp are small and can only be read from fairly close up as others have noted you can t read the display if you are looking up at it as when it s on your bed s headboard you have to sit up a bit or twist the clock the clock is smaller than it may look from the picture and the base is narrow it s much too easy to knock it over when pushing the backlight snooze button unlike many alarm clocks there s no button to push to turn off the alarm and leave it armed for tomorrow you have to fiddle with a small slide switch each and every night and each every morning 
spend a little more i bought this to record tivo dvr stuff to dvd worst frame rate capture and audio capture of avis of the four different devices i have tried completely unusable the software is a trial version instead buy the ads dvdxpress dx for a bit more ulead s software is stable and it s not a trial version it is also the only analog capture device i have tried that gives a good picture using mpeg capture pinnacle s dazzle only is tolerable using avi capture which is great if you have the drive space but the software is way too buggy 
barely adequate good first attempt at the task the second generation model ctz telezapper ii uses the three tones necessary to remove your number from all of the current computer lists 
this junk died and erased images the is perhaps the lease durable item i have purchased in years it lights up just fine and it is a reassuring led gold but it refuses to do anything with my xd card it worked just fine for days then erased about photos all of them irreplaceable cheap yes but cheap junk 
poor framerate tricky setup i really wanted to like this gadget but i ve ultimately been disappointed the idea is cool being able to see your family and carry on a free internet phone conversation with them and the price is much less than other videophone solutions out there alas there are a few problems still to be worked out with this device heres the saga of trying to just get the device to work with my network setup i tried calling dlink the ieye manufacturer linksys for my router setup comcast broadband connection and sunrocket voip for support on this issue i eventually got the device to work connecting to my parents wireless version of the ieye which i setup through a usr wireless broadband router by opening the required ports by connecting my ieye the wired ethernet version directly to my cable modem without my linksys broadband router or sunrocket voip box in the equation i then tested various configurations until i was able to determine that the linksys router model wrtgs was not forwarding ports correctly i had properly configured port forwarding linksys tech support tried but failed to help me out i swapped routers with my girlfriend who had a dlink router and the problem went away after also configuring port forwarding would have been nice if dlink could have told me when i called them for support that my router wasn t compatible with their device though it s possible that my linksys router has a broken port forwarding feature i also had to forward ports through my voip box which the sunrocket tech support people quickly told me how to do so i eventually got the damn thing working after a month and a half of trying of course that is two weeks after the standard return policy of antonline expires who i bought the device from through amazon now to performance even when the ieye is connected directly to my broadband cable modem my framerate never rises above frames per second that s both for the transmitted and received data stream on my parents end i have to connect wirelessly through their wireless router as their tv is too far from their cable modem i ve tried tweaking the speed settings on the ieye to adjust the amount of data the device is configured to send and receive but i never got an improvement dlink advertises that you can get up to frames per second using a high quality broadband connection like mine and my parents i haven t tested my broadband connection s total upload and download speed because i simply don t know how probably need some third party utility program regardless i should be getting at least kbps upload speed and at least mbps download speed at both mine and my parent s end as that is typical of cable broadband connections also the image quality from the ieye s lens and ccd is horrendous the brightness contrast and general overall sharpness of the image is lousy that s simply not acceptable you can get better framerates along with much better image quality from a good webcam using one of the messenger applications out there which is what i m going to explore doing next im going to attempt to return the devices now both mine and my parents ieye through antonline and amazon with the argument that the ieye devices don t perform as advertised and that i m late returning them because of the difficulty in testing the devices you have to coordinate with the people at the other end of the connection to determine if your own configuration is working i ll try to post an update to this review with the results of that attempt unless they can improve framerate throughput through some kind of data compression technology upgrade i can t recommend this device to anyone less critical improvements would be a better quality camera and microphone onboard and better support for setting up the devices a dedicated ieye server you can connect to test your ieye configuration settings including a list of supported and non supported routers hope this helps someone else avoid the headaches and hassles i ve been subjected to by this device andre 
doa after a couple of e mail exchanges with manufacturer s tech support card was determined to be defective replaced by retailer with port version which was in stock card continues to work fine 
nice idea but nightmare to print i love the idea of this product and i loved working with it i created a great layout that looked fabulous on screen but unless you have an epson printer it is very difficult to print out a great copy my hp deskjet could not handle the supplied photo paper so a friend printed on his lexmark for me it worked better but still had a few problems more paper should be included in the package in case of printing problems because after several printing problems we ran out of paper and i could not find the same photo paper in any store i ended up buying a second package just to get more of the same paper next time i will make a book using the ofoto site much more professional looking sided and just as cheap 
incompatible my dell photo and this server weren t compatible i think it is my printer s problem not the server s 
horid a horid thing thats incompatable with anything unless you know how to change its subnet which is impossable 
website misleading on amazon this product stated it was compatible with the sansa e series i ordered with that expectation but it does not work 
non functional in reading the reviews i can only surmise that i received a lemon i bought the device because it looked exactly like a device i had purchased for work for over more which was very effective the best i could achieve with this device was operation either the mouse positioner worked or the slide advance wheel i never got the mouse buttons to work i tried it on different computers and followed the instructions about changing channels all to no avail i took it to work and when it failed alongside it s more costly look alike i sent it back 
i d love to review this product but i ordered it and amazon sent me an entirely different product i got ordered the leapfrog and received a generic product pretty deceptive actually not happy 
what do you think its awful are you serious i bought this a while ago to see if it was cool it is a piece of junk u can barely get any channels and even if you do you can barely see them and it has loud static dont buy it its garbage 
very poor fm reception and not usable walking or jogging reception is only acceptable if you are seated with the headphone antenna adjusted to maximize signal strength 
i ve never seen such a big mouse i ve never seen such a big mouse i couldn t recognize it before i purchased think twice 
great initially but dead one month after the year warranty expired this was my favorite little device it s slow as it s a hard drive and not a flash drive but for the capacity and price it was unbeatable that is until it suddenly locked up and cannot be revived literally weeks after the meager year warranty expired a gb kingston memory stick has a year warranty i can see why this device has such a short warranty its completely unreliable long term check out the other reviews same problem months ago i would have given it stars but the obvious unreliability of the device makes it worthless in the long term too bad seagate can t raise their manufacturing quality 
don t buy this this isn t a consistent product of the time i can t get it to work after months of emails and phone calls customer service responded what a joke ! they told me the plug in the unit and then unplug wait seconds and then plug in gimme a break ! i shouldn t have to do the hokie pokie just to get it to work by the way their process didn t work poor product poor customer service poor price 
very short range on kx tg series phones i purchased the panasonic kx tgm to replace a year old sony mhz phone the sony would allow me to go about feet from the base before the signal became unusable the new panasonic has a usable range on the order of feet i have a one story year old sq ft brick home relocating the phone did not help i returned the phone for credit and bought a panasonic kx tg which is the same phone but with three color handsets thinking the first unit may have been bad not the case the replacement is just as poor in range all the other features of the phone are good and work as advertised if range is a concern for you you would do well to look at some other system 
garbage i bought this card because i had heard it works well with linux well i didn t get that far with card because when it arrived it was doa and doesn t work at all so now i have to either pay shipping to send it back to amazon or contact dlink and try to get them to send me a replacement 
cheap made in china case this case is another example of shoddy cheap made in china junk to save a buck the design of the case is basically like that of a wire frame with inserts pressure fitted only there is really no pressure ! these cases are made from very thin aluminum coated cardboard inserts with felt glued to the back only the bottom insert has rivets which are there primarily to hold the rubber feet on all other inserts slide around within the cases especially the large insert in the top of the lid as you can imagine the entire case bows and flexes with the lid closed and flexing is far worse with the lid open a full case would probably not withstand being dropped on a corner worse still the inside of the case has reinforcing brackets to keep the inserts in between each side making the inside volume non square the lid has a full inch of space for jewel cases to bounce around in and there is only one riveted u channel piece of aluminum at the top of the base and the bottom of the lid per division of the case s compartments this will present a huge problem for those who want to put paper sleeved cds and dvds into the case since there is nothing to separate the bottom of the case there is nothing to prevent liquids from penetrating the seams of the case if liquid is spilled on the edges of the case it will get in if you close the lid and shake the case around the hanging sleeves tend to come out of the u channels and bounce around the inside of the case the inside of the case smells like an old musty house in which air has not circulated for years the case only comes with hanging sleeves ! you have to go to the atlantic inc website and create an account and enter a promotional code to buy the remaining sleeves at the cost of shipping which is about another eight dollars i made the mistake of purchasing two of these cases both cases came with scratches on the aluminum and rivets that look like they damaged the aluminum cardboard panels going in and will easily pop out 
pos ! broke w in months and apple bailed on it what a crock as it looks like everyone else got good product and good service ! i got a shuffle and something happened the second time i tried to load music to make it not even play i took it to the apple store in mall of america minneapolis mn and they claimed to know there was an issue and claimed to have fixxed it i go back home ok and it still does not work apple said for they ll fix gee thanks ! i ll be looking at another brand ! apple stinks 
incompetent garbage which cannot be shut down pro compact enough to fit into a jacket pocket yet opens to a comfortable working size with full sized keys including a number row for those who do serious number entry to spreadsheets this is decidedly a deal maker over the stowaway keyboard which requires alt key combinations to access numbers and symbols the full size keys require no revamping of typing habits as does the miniaturized key spacing on the freedom keyboard to my knowledge there is no other folding bluetooth keyboard on the market at the time of this writing which has both full size keys and a number symbol row the bluetooth connection is clean lag free and accurate con the software for gaining a connection is a bit cumbersome requiring entry of a checkmark into a box with each use and then an access code on a second screen with each battery replacement see below flimsy locking mechanism not usable on a lap the manual tells us that a lock is provided to keep the opened keyboard flat while on your lap or on a non flat surface this lock is a single piece of wire about the thickness of an undone paperclip which travels along the top of the board from the left half into the right even when locked the keyboard doesn t lay flat and with the center of the board hovering over the empty chasm between the user s legs held in place only by one thin piece of wire the two halves bend to an increasingly exaggerated v shape after any amount of light handed typing hp could have saved themselves the trouble of this useless bit of cosmetics a user must find a solid flat surface to type on such as a book and of course when sitting on a flat surface the lock isn t needed the manual correctly tells us that one reason to use a wireless keyboard is to enjoy the convenience of a wireless bluetooth connection up to meters away from your pocketpc unfortunately the designers ignored this consideration when conceiving the non removable cradle a quick look at the freedom keyboard s pull out cradle offers hp a lesson in how to do it right the keyboard ships with no case as do most other portable keyboards with non rugged exteriors the attractive brushed metalic exterior of the folded case thereby scratches easily in a jacket pocket containing loose change or a set of keys it doesn t turn off yes you read that last bullet correctly you can t turn this thing off there s no power switch the button in the upper right corner of the keyboard is to establish and disengage the wireless connection between the software and the handheld it s not a power switch what this means is even when folded and not in use even when appearing to be dormant and even when the software shows that there s no bluetooth connection the keyboard is still eating your batteries the automatic sleep mode simply disables the wireless connection it does not power down the keyboard two weeks after putting in a fresh set of batteries and not using the keyboard you ll return to find them dead not the coolest way to walk into a meeting full of executives expecting you to take notes the only way to power down the keyboard is to open the battery cover and remove the batteries the battery cover need i add breaks easilly sound unbelievable go to the major websites dedicated to pocketpcs and do a search of their forums using the keywords bluetooth keyboard this is not a case of a know nothing customer who needs to read the manual the manual such as it is makes no mention of an absent power switch for the mobile user then in addition to the keyboard itself one need also travel with something stable to rest the board on to have something to prop the handheld against if distance is desired to carry the batteries separately and to re enter the access key into the software after reinserting those batteries although the folded board will fit easily into a jacket pocket the additional loose paraphernalia negates any usefulness of this mobile keyboard for the mobile user add to that the marred exterior and bent lock after minimal use the hp ipaq keyboard is worth perhaps it s retail price and then only if a consumer absolutely requires the full size keys and number row how hp ever expected anyone to sit still for this kind of idiocy eludes me all potential buyers of ipaq handhelds should take this keyboard as a reflection of what if any emphasis hp places on quality of design and the integrity of ipaq name it reflects also the degree of respect hp has for the intelligence of their customers one might easily forgive a negative design attribute like the non removable cradle or the parsimony of not including a case one might even forgive the useless locking mechanism but when hp is either too dumb to include an on off switch or they expect us to be so dumb to not notice or care then i must seriously doubt the usefulness of other products bearing the ipaq name if hp is content to offer this marginally useful toy to consumers for then i cannot believe enough magic exists in the world to suddenly make them sharp enough to produce a sophisticated device like a pocketpc for my next handheld upgrade i ll probably stay with fujitsu siemens loox i currently use a loox a truly excellent ppc or maybe go with a dell axim i won t even consider an ipaq the hp bluetooth keyboard is quite simply an offense to any consumer with even the vaguest and most forgiving sense of quality those at hp responsible for protecting public perception of the ipaq brand name should be truly ashamed of themselves 
not what is in the picture although description does not mention tv tunning the image is misleading since it shows tv besides am and fm future buyers should know what you see is not what you get i will have to buy another unit with tv tunning for the gym 
buyer s beware amazon is not an authorized samsung dealer and the manufacturer s one year warranty on this tv will not be honored by samsung 
disappointed i have been less impressed with the new case for a number of reasons the additional insulation does cause heat related performance issues i had to trim the bottom case with a sharp knife so that it didn t catch when opening and closing even after trimming the case as recommended on the speck website the bottom part of the case still doesn t secure completely to the laptop although this could be specific to my machine the additional weight on back of the screen causes the laptop to shut with considerable more force the case adds overall weight and size the case further limits the angle at which the laptop can be opened still i use the top part of the case without the bottom part the case provides some protection against the flexible nature of the screen part of the laptop if you allow the top to flex you run the risk that external pressure will push the rivets the ones that attach the apple icon into the back of your display this will cause little dark spots on your screen that don t go away 
great output but teeny weeny expensive ink cartridges just bought it today the print quality is excellent however i had to go back to the store for more ink later in the day about for a full set after printing only a couple hundred pages of medical lecture notes for school ouch ill bet cleaning the heads costs about this will probably be my last epson because of the high cost of ink to bad the manufactures don t recognize that screwing their customers on the ink lowers the customers satisfaction with them as a company 
what secure you have to be an administrator i am giving this unit the lowest possible score for the reasons below the fact that this is product by lexar is actually named secure invokes the belief it really is secure however i have been discussing this with lexar for over two weeks now without resolution the problem is that the encrypted vault the reason i purchased the thing is not available except when signed in as an administrator hello why would lexar build a unit that is smaller than some earrings my girlfriend wears if they did not expect it to be used as a portable device meaning it would be used in many different computers so if you go to the library or at work on a network or at your friend billy s house and you are not the administrator you lose ! the only way around this is to put your most sensitive material right on the public drive and not use the secure features of the drive does that make sense i was sent the software version by lexar with no improvement and have tried all of their suggestions and now the unit will display the microsoft windows error screen and shut the drive down to be fair if you do not need to access sensitive material on any computer without admin rights then this unit could work for you it works great on my home computer but i just have to admit that with a portable device i tend to want to port it around and use it on other machines and cannot if you need to access your data on many machines and wish to do so without admin rights beware ! i suggest you look at the lexar website and contact them to make sure this is possible i m still wrestling with them and am hopeful i can take them to the mat and pin them and will be able to actually use this storage device as advertised 
gb mp player i brought this peice two months ago it never worked this is a peice of junk to through in garbage if you want to through your money like that just donate your money to somebody may be in will work properly lot better products than this you can buy 
hawking hi gain antenna not as advertised i bought this antenna hoping that it would improve signal strength as they advertised db on the box the performance was worse than the original db antenna that came with my wireless adapter back it goes 
defective i read the instructions inserted a tape it made a horrible noise no matter what button i pushed nothing worked just more noise then the noise stopped and it won t do anything i can t return it because of the policy i neglected to save the box what a waste of money 
cheap hunk of junk this was the worst purchase of any type of computer hardware that i have ever made it felt very light and flimsy the definition of cheap plastic not just the construction but the performance was terrible it would work perfectly for about a half hour and then go on a break and do nothing for about minutes this was very very frustrating maybe i was just unlucky and received a defective one but i wouldn t take that chance again i wish i could give this device a worse rating somewhere around would be much more appropriate 
piece of garbage created hw probs on d link router i attached this antenna to a d link di wireless router to try to expand the range then all of the wired ethernet ports started dropping connectivity and i was getting hardware error reports from the network monitor took the antenna off and it all worked fine again you would think d link would have at least tested this with their own product 
bluetooth i recently bought this product and it was not working on my printer and computer i am not sure why it is considered plug and play i sold it on ebay recently 
works ! sometimes i bought one of these from circuit city for i live in st pete tampa area the auto station find was not very effective i found clearer ones by manually searching when it s connected to your ipod it definetly slows down the menus the buttons on the icarplay are also very unresponsive i would press the change station button nothing happened then press it again then it would jump twice so my advice is have patience when navigating the icarplay s menus sometimes i could get it to work with an acceptable amount of static but then the unit would randomly stop working and i get blasted with noise from my radio being cranked up you cannot adjust the volume on the icarplay only on your radio i returned the unit and i am in the process of getting a pioneer head unit with a built in auxillery input on the front panel i cannot recommend this unit it also looks cheap for the price point it looks like it should cost about dollars one postive note it does charge the ipod fairly quickly also in my wifes car where she a factory stereo the static wasn t quite as annoying i have amplified tweeters which pick up everything including static i also thought that putting the unit closer to the stereo would improve the sound oddly it doesn t seem to make a difference you could also look at one of the wired ipod adapters such as the pioneer cd ib ipod adapter 
almost impossible to use with large capacity ipods i have this cable installed on a cda deck using a gb ipod photo the interface completely circumvents everything that is good about the interface on the ipod itself the controls and display on the ipod are disabled when connected the head unit you must use the head unit to control the ipod and you cannot see information about the currently playing track on the ipod when searching through artists albums songs or playlists on the deck only one item is viewable at a time contrasted with or items viewable on the ipod screen itself this makes it extremely dangerous to browse through your music while driving if you don t already know exactly what you want to listen to one tick of the control knob on the deck scrolls through item artistalbumsongplaylist on the ipod scrolling does not speed up as you continue to turn the knob if you want to scroll through artists expect to spend fully minutes or more twiddling the knob while driving i can t even begin to describe how frustrating this is there is absolutely no way to speed up the process there is no fast scrolling mode that skips through artists at a time there is no way to scroll by letter of the alphabet no nothing when scrolling through items the menu returns to the beginning of the list each time you pull it up if you spend seconds scrolling to new order then next you want to listen to something by nirvana have fun scrolling for another seconds its as if alpine didn t bother to user test this system at all with large capacity ipods it s a complete embarassment and i will be returning it as soon as possible 
not for ford expeditions well i thought that this was going to be the answer for getting a decent xm signal but alas foiled again ford expeditons and up have a built in antenna in the rear passenger side windwow the xm transmitter is not powerful enough to send a decent signal all the way back there to a lousy antenna idea anyway i peeked through crutchfield and used their compatability engine for my vehicle it said that this item would work w o and special equipment i took apart the dash peeked at the radio antenna input and was surprised well not really it is a ford after all to find that ford uses a proprietary antenna plug so far i am unable to find an adapter that will let me use this adapter in my vehicle hence the star nice concept too bad i shelled out bucks for something that doesn t fit my vehicle 
tape reel sticks does not spin i couldn t get this cassette adapter to work in my car upon investigation i found that the tape reel sticks and doesn t spin i opened the cassette adapter up its screwed together and found that the gears do not line up very well needless to say i returned this cassette adapter to amazon i was pleased to see that amazon paid for return postage on this defective product i will be buying another cassette adapter from a local store maybe radio shack so that i can more easily return the item if it doesn t work it seems that a lot of these cassette adapters have flaws in them and the more expensive models are not always better good luck 
kingston gb sd memory card this sd would not work in my nikon coolpix s camera but the fuji and sandisk product did 
lovely sound horrible build quality i bought a pair in january and loved them sound is as lovely as everyone describes however there are something seriously lacking in the build quality the soft wires felt flimsy to me when i first opened it but i thought i d just take extra care at month of careful usage the plastic covered wires from earbuds downwards became so weather hardened that i could almost use them as chopsticks and makes it so the earbuds popped out at the slightest motion at months of careful usage the wires had half ripped from the plug which i repaired the best i could with unsightly electrical tape however at rd month the left bud fell completely off i am very disappointed it is one of the best sounding phones i ve ever had ive owned both grado s and s and sennheisers but man they need to do something about making this baby last 
unreliable manufacturing i bought this in november and used it a couple times it worked on one disk and not the other i went to use it again and it stopped working i then called maxell and it only has a warranty so i am feeling ripped off and angry oh well that ll teach me to buy maxell anything 
slows my computer down the light makes my computer very sluggish even when my laptop is not running off of the battery browsing the internet especially is painfully slow and i am on a high speed cable connection 
horrible customer support i had a terrible time with hp s costumer support when i needed help with my scanner all the email support was for windows only and the phone support was all outsourced and the technicians spoke terrible english it was awful i ve gotten stuck with a product and can t get any help with it 
don t buy this this is basically a male to rca cable for you could get the same exact cable for at radio shack yeah you get a dock and power brick too but price it out not worth it buy the cable at rs it ll work exactly the same don t be fooled if you want the dock and power brick buy them seperately you ll save major 
still cheaper than the apple version even though there is an outrageous hidden charge of for a item the price is still about a third of the equivalent item offered by apple edited aug does what it claims to do convenient and easy to use change my rating to star 
not waterproof weather resistant just make sure you know the difference these speakers are not meant to get wet they can handle being outside ambient moisture temp wind etc but aren t meant to be directly in the path of rain or snow they are only really usable outside if you have large eaves overhangs under which to place them the only reason i didn t give this item star is because i probably could have found all this out if i had read the amazon advertisement enough and at least they seemed well packaged before i shipped them back 
terrible either the item is faulty or my television is too old but it didnt work for me i needed to use the component from vga to avoid taking up my s video and dvi openings on ym video card and the television never picked up the signal instead if you have a component open for video just use the s video converter not from this item 
not for the iaudio like amazon claims i purchased an iaudio u mp player for someone as a gift on amazon they recommend this case as an accessory as already noted by another user this case does not fit the u player and i am just re emphasizing that point do not buy this as an armband for the u 
service plan never received i have never received any correspondence from this company they were supposed to send the service plan within weeks after i received the television however as i stated i never received the plan ! 
randomly drops connection i also have the problem of random disconnects we had a techie come in and try to set it up for us he got it working but the thing still randomly boots us off it does the job i guess of giving us a connection but it s got almost no reliability i hear it s got a lifetime warranty good we can return it 
gets rid of dust and fingerprints but leaves a mess the other two reviewers got it mostly right but let me make it clear this lightly moistened wipes can indeed remove fingerprints and dust and even prevent dust build up for a few days the problem is when the cleaning liquid dries it leaves ugly fog like marks on your lcd screen i ve found out that after it dries using a lint free soft cloth to lightly polish the screen helps clean up the screen completely but then i could have just used the cloth to remove cust and fingerprints i think these wipes can be helpful when you have serious fingerprints or dirt not just dust on your lcd screen otherwise for most people this is just a waste of money and can actually make you frustrated 
the real truth alot of the reviews i read here are misleading most of these complaints are related to not knowing how to use the gps correctly however certain problems do exist with the roadmate t t units here are some pros and cons i have observed first the pros better than reading a map lol easy to read screen and large enough to handle big fingers with few mistakes built in mp player now the cons unit often freezes up more so after having updated the firmware you can have either music or directions not both at same time photo viewer is terrible ! dont care much about that feature though cannot use an fm transmitter to play music directions over the radio due to severe interferrence maps are not as accurate as they would have you believe not good for commercial drivers as excluding certain roads is a pain apples for apples i think the tomtom would be a much better buy i have been quite disappointed with the magellan roadmate t the price has dropped significantly since i purchased mine so if you want to resell the unit later you will lose alot in the investment you only get the car charger for it so you might want to buy the ac adapter especially if you want to transfer music onto the sd card the gps unit uses a different format on the sd card memory card once you put it into your gps it can t be used with your computer digital camera etc you have to use the magellan software included with the unit to transfer mp files onto the sd card you will most likely also need the external antenna for it to avoid freeze ups finally the map software is out of date and magellan has yet to update their maps save yourself the headache and look elsewhere 
do not buy this product this jacket is so tight that it holds down all the buttons at once and the creative zen will not work with it on do not waste your money on this product you will be very disappointed 
teleporting and dissapearing mouse curser well i read the reviews for this mouse and since it had mostly star raitings i decided to buy it i just recieved it today and already it has given me problems the mouse curser either clicked on something or while being moved moves on it s own around the screen and sometimes dissapears im most likely going to return it 
so so been using the product for months now battery time isnt great i constantly need to recharge the battery people always complain of an echo 
prepare to lose your data i have about live concerts that i burned onto tdk discs about years ago none of them are playable now going forward i will only use mitsui gold cds 
unreliable i ordered this dvd player so i wouldn t wear down my xbox by playing movies on it all the time i didn t have any of the audio problems that others have reported however after about weeks of use it just died i couldn t even get it to power on if you re looking for a cheap dvd player this will do just remember you get what you pay for 
unreliable product and unresponsive customer service after less than one week of use i am forced to return this product due to its inability to maintain a reliable network connection in days i have had to cycle power on this unit on average more than once per day after it locks up the web ui fails to respond to connection requests it loses the ability to communicate with the internet and the only solution is to cycle power i have tried to work with netgear technical support but their suggestions eg lower mtu have been useless and their responses quite tardy if you are looking for a firewall vpn unit i suggest you pass on this particular product 
not worth it purchased this antenna to extend the range of my linksys compact wireless router made no difference at all ! tried to return but could not get a return authorization number from the vendor also i was surprised at the size of the antenna it was much bigger than i anticipated and did not fit in the space where i had the router located 
starting to go after two years i never had a problem with this radio until today it has been exactly two years since i bought the delphi boom box my display unit on the cd part of the boom box has gone kaput the radio still works but i cannot see what radio station i have on and i cannot see the song number on the cds i called delphi tech support and was told that since i am passed my one year warranty i am out of luck they can do nothing for me they told me it would be cheaper to buy a new one because to fix it would probably cost me about an hour i can probably live without the display unit but i hope this doesn t mean that more things with this radio will start to go wrong be prepared to possibly have to upgrade after two years with this one 
returned it screen went blank i really wish this product had been better designed because i loved the fact that it s a tablet style and it s a lot easier to hold and watch especially when you are sitting in tight spots like a bus or plane and space is at a premium alas my unit had several problems and i decided to return it the biggest problem was that after about days of use the screen went blank on me when i turned it on i had to fiddle with the battery pack and plug it into the a c adaptor to get the screen picture to come back on a few days later it happened again and then again the other big problem was that it really didn t like playing dvds that i burned myself it played regular store dvds well but when i played my own burned dvds whether it was dvd r or dvd r the player s picture would constantly freeze it just couldn t handle the slightest imperfections on the disc and since home burned dvds aren t burned in the same fashion as commercial dvds this player was just too sensitive to successfully playback home burned dvds the final concern was the fact that it didn t come with any kind of case and there is no way to protect the screen while transporting it i was very concerned that over time the screen would get scratched and damaged you would seriously need to consider buying a rd party case for this unit designwise the tablet style is a great idea and i hope that more manufacturers start making tablet style units in the future 
this card is nothing more than a mmc this card is nothing more than a multimediacard mmc there are many options out there for purchasing mmc also securedigital sd cards are fully compliant with the palm pilots for which this memory card is being marketed at the time of writing this review this was among the most expensive of comparable cards in fact yesterday at a local retailer i saw a mb x the capacity for five dollars more so my advice is that you do purchase expansion cards to take full advantage of the power of your palm i have purchased many and am able to use my palm as an mp player using realone a video player using kinoma an atlas using mapopolis and a video game system using palmone sega classic cards and downloaded games all at the same time do buy sd or mmc cards to expand but i would encourage you to comparison shop looking for better prices jacob hantl 
so so this charger does not seem to charge the batteries fully i thought that my rechargable batteries were out of life but discovered that it was just a case of this charger failing to recharge them fully my daughter brought home a cheap sakar overnight charger when visiting i popped in a set of batteries i thought were done for and found them to be just fine using her sakar charger what happens on my charger is that the lights indicating that the batteries have been fully charged all go off and the batteries are cool to the touch indicating that they have been fully recharged nope ! only about half way recharged 
poor quality burned shorted out in hours i was able to install this adapter on my windows xp dell and it worked with my household wireless network at least for a while the next time we went into the room less than hours later it had shorted out it smelled like an electrical fire and of course the little indicator lights were not on any more the quality of this expensive speed booster adapter is awful awful awful read these reviews do not buy this product 
read all reviews before purchasing this card i along with many others have experienced sound lock ups squeals and computer lock ups with this card and the others in this series my sound issues have occurred mostly during games sound quality is excellent in windows and when the card is working properly in games most of the issues appear to involve some kind of hardware conflict as most afflicted users have high end computer systems running sli although the problems are not exclusive to these configurations i am currently working with cl to resolve the issue but i m not sure they know what is causing it as this issue has been around since aug i am not saying dont buy just be sure you have fully investigated all the issues before making the purchase as i doubt your installation and use with be trouble free 
ecm cs does not have battery power capability despite being advertised otherwise on sony s site as well as many vendors this unit is plug in power only it does not come with a battery clip to permit operation with non plug in power devices i purchased and had to return 
good features but for one serious flaw i bought this receiver to use as a preamp in my system i based my decision on information as stated on the pioneer web site and the attractive price compared to some of the other options i considered this receiver does have a number of good features but has one serious flaw it will not display on screen status messages for daily operations like volume and sound mode unless you have a pioneer display and run another special cable from the receiver to the tv as a side note pioneer needs to understand we want to run less cables to our display that means you only get to see the simple set up screen on your non pioneer tv which you will probably use when you first set up the receiver and very infrequently after that the set up menu lets you set things like assignable inputs and audio calibtraion sounds like a small deal but in many home theaters including mine the electronics are not in the line of site mine are in a closet just outside the theater with an infrared repeater system controlling everything this not uncommon many have thier electronics isolated like me or behind cabninet doors and it means i have no idea what the volume is what sound mode i am using or anything beyond the set up menu unless i go into the closet bad bad bad ! this seems to be a marketing ploy by pioneer to get you to buy pioneer tv s and projectors and it is beyond stupid if this was not the case i would rate this receiver much higher but it is a serious flaw it makes using this unit extremely tedious and difficult this limitation also means if you have mulitple displays i have a plasma tv and projector in my theater you need to run thier special cable to both displays and both have to be pioneer again i have to say bad bad bad the other features are as stated on the pioneer website but they are lying when they say this unit has on screen display and this will be a major drawback for users that do not have the receiver in the line of site when using thier systems unless they have a pioneer display with sr oh yeah your pioneer display has to be also be equipped with sr thier way of linking the two units if your pioneer display is not equipped with sr you are again out of luck did i mention this is bad feb addition to reveiw i called onecall and they will take unit back but at restocking fee plus paying for shipping both ways while onecall really did nothing wrong pioneer is lying about the osd ! it is one of thier vendors and not the customer s fault either and the customer should not pay for this kind of fraud buyer beware from onecall thier customer service on this one was not good 
hunk of junk go for the manual version luckily i didn t pay a penny for the motorized skipdr as it was given to us as a prize i have the original manual skipdr which worked every time and i always end up using it instead it has more than paid for itself in repaired cd s for an entire kit at a wholesale club that came with spare sanding discs and the whole shebang the motorized version didn t come with any deep scratch sanding pads which i need about of the time for a badly scratched disc most of the time the automatic sensor fails to detect that a disc is even in the machine and won t start turning so i have to squeeze it together to make it work 
will not work i purchased one that never worked i had it replaced and it still didn t work i followed directions explicitly and tried different locations on the fm band that had no signal present not a sound didn t matter which volume control was turned up or if they were both up nothing therefore i have no idea about performance 
reeks i had the same experience as another reviewer here the sleeves smell very strong i put them out in the garage till i can return them i bought these elswhere but came here to see if others had the same experience low behold yes they did ! to me its almost a musty odor probably has something to do with them having to be shipped from taiwan ! the sleeves i ve bought in the past were made by ampad here in the us i ll go back to buying their brand 
they just don t make them to last anymore the onkyo tx receiver lasted less than one month i purchased it to replace a fisher receiver i have had for years thought it was time to replace it while listening to one of my favorite jazz tunes this new onkyo receiver sparked followed by the smell of a burning resistor needless to say i put my year old fisher receiver back in service and continued listening to my favorite jazz tunes they just don t make them like they use to more to follow pending the results of the repair 
compatibility issues cosmetically pleasing is about the only good thing you can say about this unit the included software does contain viruses the included software is a reminate of the late s to early s the tablet itself does not work under win nor winxp under second edition it stops responding quite frequetly and you have to unplug and plug the unit back in to get it to respond again this unit would be great if it came out years ago you get what you pay for 
geko only overpriced piece of plastic that will only fit the garmin geko unit though the description mentions that fact nowhere 
month fan life i had this unit for about months one day smelled somthing getting hot reached behind the computer a touched the power supply and it was hot enough to blister my finger i don t think i need any more of these 
slightly disappointed it doesn t play well with my stereo system it is either too amplified or too low for the switch options under the turntable other than that it seems to be a nice turntable and seems to work fine 
a real troubled lemon ! stay away i purchased this unit about months ago after the warranty ran out the unit first quit working with r media then there is an issue with finalizing the dvd which makes the dvd unusable unfortunately this is after you record your show then all is lost it started making squawking noises like something is very wrong it never remembered the language or channels panasonic never did anything about this after reading others with these same issues i would recommend that you buy from another manufacturer 
bw anti glare protector i had high hopes for this protector however i was disappointed the back of the protector is adhesive when you apply the screen protector there are literally dozens of visable air bubbles under the protector no matter how hard i tried i could not remove them boxwave even includes a bubble remover to glide over the screen to try to squeeze them out but it did nothing i removed and reapplied it several times with the same results if there weren t any bubbles under the protector it would be the perfect screen protector 
it works but sound quality is not good other than the power switch is not easy to see the most issue with this microphone is the sound quality not that good use this microphone to record music for sure will disappoint you even using it for church meeting recording you would not get excited for its sound quality if you can tolerate the size of sony ecm ms you may like the sound quality of that microphone if you like a small lapel microphone with true voice try the akg wms wireless system our people are much happier with the akg wireless microphone than this one 
bogus review request i ve replied to this request three times the product was returned to vendor and cc charges were reversed 
yamaha yamaha its a japanese company makes many products for example ics pianos keyboards audio products the yamaha s best audio product is ns m a book shelf speaker nsm is the best speaker made in japan in the history unfortunately ns m is not sold now and more unfortunately yamaha now has become a trivial maker ns is only one of low cost speakers 
do not buy these well what i said above pretty much sums it up do not buy these i got these before the summer of im going to say around may they stopped working by november i didn t even wear them around i used them with my computer and my dvd player when my roomate was sleeping pos and a waste of money they look nice but that is all do not use you money on these skullcandy should be ashamed of themselves for producing such a piece of garbage 
don t buy this stuff the sound quality is really awful i gave it a two star because i give credit to the other aspects of the product like the casing the gooseneck support and the fact that it is easy to turn it back on when it loses its power however the most important thing is the sound quality which really is very very poor 
ml hahaha ml for i would refuse to buy any printer that used this cartridge on principal die in a fire hp 
avoid buying it after few months of using it it started to lag badly and the scroll wheel stopped working i ll never buy logitech mouse again 
if this is intended for bittorrent purposes save your money ever wonder how many amazon product reviews are submitted by corporate shills in the case of the dgl i m ready to guess it s about okay i m not totally serious serious in that estimate i m just disappointed in the product im not a gamer and perhaps that s why the dgl didn t work for me i like to download tv programs via bittorrent i download whole seasons at a time which runs into the multiple gigabytes as you other bittorrent enthusiasts may know the average home network router has a tendency to freeze when bt pulls too many connections through it i find it very depressing to get up in the morning or come home from work and find that my downloads stopped short many hours ago for some months now i ve been in search of an affordable router to avoid this problem considering what i ve spent so far perhaps i would ve been better off to buy something expensive and capacious from the start in any case it s difficult to derive any sort of consensus about router efficacy from the web there probably are more than a few lying corporate shills floating around cyberspace but mostly there are well meaning people who report good or bad results without taking into account operating system exact router model broadband type bittorrent client or the size of the torrents they download i was mildly excited to find so many positive amazon reviews for the dgl perhaps i thought a router built for high performance gaming would account for connection issues similar to bittorrent s right about now the cognescenti reading this little tale of woe are probably laughing their butts off let me cut to the chase here after i hooked up the dgl and started two bt downloads one a mere g the other g everything looked fine for about three hours then the silly thing froze on me as happened with the linksys and netgear routers wired and wireless i ve tried i obtained the latest firmware for it january installed this and tried again the results were similar except that now i noticed the router freezing on me even during bt free web surfing regardless of my bittorrent client azureus utorrent bitcomet or its settings the results didn t improve if you re a gamer maybe you ll roll the dice on the dgl if you re a bittorrent enthusiastic such as myself you should probably keep looking 
clock fine radio lousy the clock itself works well it did take till sometime during the middle of the night for the atomic time to connect we set a backup alarm the first night the idea of utilizing atomic time for an alarm is a fantastic idea but why would scott put such a lousy tuner in an atomic clock radio doesn t make sense to me granted i live in a rural area but i am able to receive both am and fm stations from as far away as fresno some miles away on other radios in the house including a small portable battery operated one and we do have a local fm station the tuner is so sensitive that i had to use both hands to steady the dial when trying to tune in a station i am unable to receive one static free am station and i eventually very gingerly dialed in two fairly clear fm stations one spanish speaking from fresno one local but neither stay tuned in overnight by morning when the alarm goes off nothing but static a strange thing though once while trying to locate a station i received a fairly clear one from salt lake city wow i plan to return the product 
generic chip i thought i was getting a pny sdram chip got a generic chip that doesn t work in anything i won t do it agai 
don t every waster your money i purchased gigbit com extermely bad on gigabit many errors with applications exchange server remote desktop loop in network ultimately replaced it with linksys much cheaper but excellent performance i am happy no 
short on features the britannica concise also comes in a downloadable version which if you have a good size sd card it would prove more convenient than whipping out an extra card dedicated only to the britannica i have both the columbia down loadable encyclopedia and this b e all around i much prefer the columbia it is much easier to navigate it has plenty of options the b e downloadable only has four beam deletefonts and resolution and is much funner to use the only advantage this britannica has over the columbia is over all it has a few more entries but not always more detailed the b e claims to be but looking up israel for example it stopped at the end of after israeli troops abruptly withdrew from lebanon the columbia on the other hand went up to the israeli conflict with hezbollah in july the newest article i could find on the britannica was 
avoid if you have nec a it will not work on this drive period i switched to maxell and fujifilm disks and now i m a happy camper 
cd player i bought this cd player for my daughter for a christmas present the radio works fine the tape player works find but the cd player will only run min and then it turns itself off something wrong there won t buy another one i am very upset about this seeing my daughter lives far away from here can t do much about it now so we are stuck with something that don t work 
cool idea but this device has lots of problems the customer support was not very good either we had difficulty setting up the wifi access when we got it customer support provided no help at all we finally figured it out on our own the software constantly freezes often requiring rebooting the last straw was today when all of the applications disappeared from the desktop we ll take our refund and purchase a laptop 
crappy tuner i m very dissapointed with this boombox the fm tuner has too much interference the fm is fine if you listen to a strong station but if you tune to a weaker station and your close to a downtown area you will hear or strong stations bleeding through the weaker ones i ve tried ajusting the coils but this model has no ajustments for fm only am the am has bleed too so if you try to pick up distant stations at night you may hear the strong station next to it for example i live in atlanta ga so the strongest am signal is wsb so if i try to tune into wbbm at night i get bleeding through i have had other panasonic boomboxes that don t have this trouble with am so if you listen to the radio like i do please check it out you ll see what i mean i hope panasonic will correct this on future model 
incompatible make sure you know that these will work with your camcorder before buying apparently they work fine with sony camcorders the packet too says so but not with canon also it s incompatible with my new panasonic camcorder too interestingly it was displayed as a combo offer when i bought my panasonic camcorder which is the reason why i bought it anyway but got duped 
don t buy i got this cd player because i thought sony was a good company plus i liked the look of it but after just months after purchase and not even using it that often it has already broken i paid about dollars for this cd player so i am very disappointed if i were you i would buy a different cd player 
defective product i ordered this product and put it in my nikon d the product was improperly manufactured and caused the pins in my camera to bend rendering it inoperable i had no idea what the cause was and went to my camera store and ended up damaging one of their cameras as well we took a quick look at the card and the holes were obviously improperly aligned the damage to the cameras was repairable and the replacement card i received worked ok but this is really not an acceptable situation for such an expensive piece of equipment 
notorious base problem after having installed the unit for days the suction cup snapped off the plastic mounting this was a spantaneous break while driving sending the unit flying very dangerous ! tomtom would not replace the unit as the claim that paart is warranted only for weeks ! buyer beware see the tomtom forum for description and picture and other links to the base issue 
not good i got this product a while ago it would work then it d stop then i d reinstall everything it d worok again but soon it would stop working all over again it seems that i can get it to work whenever i want provided i completely reinstall the software whenever i need to reboot my pc so it sits there unused it s a piece of junk 
really crummy software interface transferring the first album to my pc took roughly hours the second took hours the third about hours and the fourth about hours learning the software interface took an inordinate amount of time even though i ve been an interface programmer after learning the software it appears every album will cost about an hour to record mark the songs name the songs and write the songs as mp if i want to edit out song parts or eliminate pops clicks it will take longer its really time consuming and the software doesn t make it simple or intuitive the turntable is of reasonable quality it s just a regular turntable with a built in pre amp you turn the pre amp on when recording to your pc turn if off if you want to use the turntable with your regular stereo 
crashcrash can i give it negative stars i actually have no idea how it works on my palm treo i was never able to get that far i installed the software to my windows xp desktop and it would not allow me to install the palm software no device found ran my cpu at and refused to let go or be terminated and then crashed my computer on reboot i discovered that it s autostarting sucking of my cpu won t let go won t terminate and as soon as i opened the ui it crashed my computer 
flashy but not very good at navigation i have this in my car and my wife has a garmin quest older model the pioneer works ok but looses lock easier and the database is not as up todate as the garmin i recommend carrying a phone book with you since the database doesn t have many newer stores and locations it also doesn t take you as close to your destination sometimes it stops directing you about a half mile away finding stores and points of interest is difficult without the address it does do a good job of navigating on freeways with very nice diagrams of each intersection it also has xm nav traffic as an option and i do like how it informs me when traffic is backed up if you really need the xm radio and traffic i would consider this gps if navigation is your primary function you will be much happier with a garmin the data for the pioneer is still and the replacement data disks are i can only hope the updates will be more affordable 
item came in defective the lcd screen didn t work the first dvd i played hooked up to the tv screen stopped reading at track i returned the item to the address writen on the box it came back because the return address is a different one so i had to return it a second time at my expenses of course despite having nothing to do with the fact that the item was defective i only got refunded thirds of the purhase price 
i drops this product was useless i was trying to fix my screen and all it did was make things worse i got a microfiber cloth and everything and nothing seemed to happen it s not worth the money 
good light short life this is a very well designed light and works very well you have better control of the light vs snake neck light types the quailty of light put out is good and is not so bright as to create glare there is one major flaw in this light it has a very short life span it died after only two months 
the worst power inverter i ve seen yet first off this thing was almost too long to fit between the lighter and other parts of the vehicle i bought this to power my laptop on a trip and it worked fine on the way out on the way back though the power kept cutting out randomly as said in another review when i unplugged to it fell apart for the rest of the trip it kept falling apart and eventually i lost the internal spring and couldn t re assemble it it was the worst thing i have ever bough 
connections are too tight ! what happened to monster quality control what has happened to monster s quality in i had a discount on monster cable through my employer and purchased close to retail prices worth of their cables for wiring up my home theater i have been using the gamelink with s video for my ps and that works great here it is years later and i buy these gamelink for use with my new hdtv with component inputs when i tried to install them i thought i was going to snap the connections off my tv because of the amount of force i had to exert with much determination i got them to connect i switched on the ps and experienced no video just sound i had even a harder time removing them when comparing these cables to my older s video gamelinks the differences are the new wires are lighter rigid and the connectors are definately too small in diameter in hand they feel cheaper compared to the heavier more pliable older wires i will no longer buy monster cables and i do not recommend these to anyone audioquest is much better too bad they don t make gaming cables 
what a let down i purchased this mp player thinking it was a good purchase boy was i wrong creative labs tend to have glitches whether it be computer hardware software or other products like this one now having problems with the product is one thing but customer service is lousy and they could give a rats also when i ordered seperate batteries from their online store they mentioned after i purchased their product that it was going to be delayed for an extra month my mp player stopped working after months i did get it to work again two months later the screen told me i had hardware problems ok so i download the drivers that is supposed to fix the problem no go oh and i forgot to mention that i am working in eastern europe at the time so it makes matters even better trying to get ahold of them via phone save yourself some frustration and get something better iriver maybe just stay away from creative lab products 
disappointing i thought this was something i would use and enjoy after just a few uses i can t be bothered with it most of the words i tried to looked up were not there it may be of use to a gradeschooler but anyone with a higher reading level would get nothing but a bookmark and i would rather use a paperclip 
not for big screens i have to agree with another review i just read here the quality seems to be good but it s just too small for any big screen ours is a philips ambilight pf the description here says the wall mount is for but the manufacturer does not agree with that on the box and in the manual it says don t believe that either it s only just over wide so there s just no way it s also not going to work well if your studs are more than for example apart i m also disappointed by the service of peerless because i emailed them the story above weeks ago and i never got any reaction this one is going back to amazon we bought a sanus now which seems to be perfect and not that much more expensive here at amazon while it costs about double elsewhere tip check your manual thoroughly and see if it mentions anything about vesa 
incompatible with my burner this media did not work on my brand new asus burner even after updating the firmware 
not working or printing properly i don t know if the cartridge is dry but it is not printing properly unlike the previous cartridges we bought from you 
if you want to get lost buy this product this navigational system is useless i have never gotten so lost before in my life it tells you to take next left when indeed it is in about lefts vise versa with rights gave to my daughter and she constantly called me lost and upset so i tried it myself it literally took me about miles out of my way to get to a local establishment tried changing the preferences and it was worse checked the manual tried everything if you put it on preferences for no toll roads highways it takes you in circles down back roads till your dizzy if you program it on tolls highways it will take you miles out of your way to locate a toll road and then back again if you program to the middle of the preference line it does not know where the heck you are and keeps searching stay away ! this one is a waste of money 
if only it could receive fm stations i ve been using this radio for about six months now i don t actually use it very often because of the poor reception i have an old cassette walkman that gets better fm reception and gets used more often the good points on this radio are simple to use small and light only uses one aaa battery which lasts a long time and has weather band however the fm reception is very poor signal separation is very poor even when listening to powerful local stations reception quality varies greatly with minor movement of the headphone cord in general acceptable reception is only possible in open air sites with careful positioning of the radio and headphone cord and while remaining immobile i plan to discard this unit and buy a sangean 
easy but ports wear out too quickly i work at a company that has had a many as of these installed at once the problems were few at first but over time you had to turn it off and back on to get it to start printing eventually the ethernet port seemed to wear out you had to jiggle the cat cord to get the link light to turn on the software is great but the device itself is poor quality we have begun phasing these ps s out at our company and only have left 
batteries or are they heres the thing about batteries they eat people yeah you can never trust a battery cause those things are heartless especially rayovac those give me the creeps shudder so the next time you think about buying batteries think about b epbatteries eat people dont even think about it punk 
best for your printer worst for your pocketbook this is a great printer and the ink cartridge system is tops but this item is available elsewhere for much less amazon should do better than this 
unusable after every five minutes or so the signal would cut out control would usually be restored some seconds later but not after whatever combination of pressed buttons had been sent continually to the game often times forcing me to run into a pit fire till i was out of ammo or whatever i read the manual and they recommended hitting a button on the controller to change the signal frequency in case i was getting some signal interference same problem i then read up on user reviews and heard there are line ofsight issues so i tried plugging the usb receiver in to different ports on my computer same problem i then tried getting a usb cradle which allowed me to place the usb receiver around different parts of the room allowing better line of sight with the controller while unfortunately rendering the wireless nature of the controller redundant same problem i then different combinations of removing and updating the manufacturer s drivers same problem i then exchanged the item for another same model same problem i then returned the unit and got a logitech problem solved ! 
construction quality below expected i ve bought one of the c platinum because i needed a calculator in my office i don t do financial calculations so probably i ll use the calculator only to make elemental arithmetics but i like rpn and the programmable features build quality is below expected intro key responsiveness is different than other keys the soft case finnish is bad and the support pieces are not well adjusted so the calculator is slightly unstable with the tag price this machine has you expect to get a perfectly assembled piece disappointed 
why do these require battery i did not like the fact that this microphone needs a hard to find battery which is not included in the box it was sold 
nuulooq not so hot i bought this item with great expectations but was disappointed enough to return it today one big caveat on performance however i am running an older single processor mac g which although i use it in a professional graphics capacity every day photoshop is a bit pokey by todays standards after downloading tiger which is required for the tooldail app i got the thing going this is what i found evan after setting all the tooldial prefs to the fastest speed i got slow and jerky navigation w the nav ring overshooting the area i wanted to see because of a delayed response also to pan upwards on the page requires reaching over the top of this inch tall device to press with a firm pressure on the far side of the ring which requires a repositioning of the entire hand poor ergonomiics in my opinion seems like they went for a sexy look concept instead an ipod type dialing motion is fine on an ipod but on this device took many rapid circles on top of the tooldial to effect much change in brush size etc and seemed much less sensitive and intuitive than a rub strip on a music synthisizer or a waacom pressure pad the trigger points funtion but require surprisingly heavy pressure to operate at least to times the pressure of a mouse click this kind of treatment hours a day would send my aging wrists to the glue factory within a week there may be a device out there that will someday revolutionize my workflow but this isnt it back it goes 
nice unint when it work but bluetooth is very flakey i am an air force trained techie and have been for over years i have a lot of experience with computers and electronics after a lot of research i went with the hollux gpslim initially i was very pleased with the device until it started having problems at first it would never lock on with the satellites yellow light stayed on i found out the unit went into sirf protocol mode i had to find a program called sirf demo to get it out of sirf protocol and placed it into the usable protocol of nmea next the device started having problems with with the blue tooth connection the blue light would never turn on i would have to turn the device on and off about times before the magic blue light would turn on and then sometimes it would only turn on constant and not blink i could bypass about times turning it on and off by bouncing the device off my steering wheel this is a ridiculous thing to have to do to get it to work i emailed tech support and tried to call them all to no response now it is the most finicky device i have ever had i am often tempted to throw this piece of junk out the window and be done with it i must strongly recommend you stay away from this device and probably hollux all together now i will have to buy another gps 
bad bad bad waste of time and money if i could give this device a review of less than one star i would an mp player is nothing more than a usb memory stick with a player wrapped around it it should just work however i ve run into the following while attempting to set it up unrecognized device uninstall usb device and try again device malfunctioned uninstall broken device from device manager and try again recognized device but says there are two removable disks that are both zero bytes in size links in tech support page all give errors device driver download from coby only downloads a font file no driver its too late in the evening to call support it was a christmas gift for my son from out of state no reciept can t return it might make a good item to throw at the neighbors cats when they get in my yard other companies have figured out how to make a portable music player just work with my computer why can t these guys my time is much more valuable than the time i spent to not get it working 
didn t help my player can t say much about this item my dvd player wouldn t even load it either the cleaner is useless or my dvd player is too far gone ! 
don t buy this when i first got this camera i was satisfied it is complicated to use definitely not intuitive because it does so much with so few buttons that you need to scroll through endless screens at time sto do what you want however it took pretty good pictures however soon after the warranty expired it began to overexpose pictures and we couldn t stop it from doing that we tried to contact fuji but have gotten no response my wife found that this is a common problem overeposure and lack of response from fuji which is probably why they have a lot of refurbished ones to sell hopefully they have fixed the problem but i wouldn t bet my money on it this camera has given us more frustration than it is worth 
the worst and most expensive router i ve owned so far this thing is garbage i originally had a client buy it but we couldn t get quick vpn to work right back then i got the unit in the end and it worked for a year or so then all of a sudden the diag light started flashing and the unit stopped working i reset it and updated the firmware that completely toasted it and i had to reload the firmware with tftp then there were the notorious mtu problems ident is still not filterable in the new firmware among other shortcomings you have to forward the port to nowhere manually finally got it to work again for a couple of hours with the new firmware before the diag light started flashing again and this pathetic router failed again now it s going in the trash i read that these have a cmos battery inside them which can cause problems and is not user replaceable if that s true it s funny how none of the other old cheap routers i have used ever had any trouble with that right now my old cheap d link router had to take the place of this overpriced trash marketing this model as a small business router is nothing more than a joke 
tight fit for the ipod this would be probably be best for a mini it was just too tight for the color screen ipod after working hard to squeeze it in i had to pull it back out to make any selections on the ipod it looks good and fits well but it s just not userfriendly 
worked great for a couple of days i was so excited about how great this product worked when i got it i had purchased the fm transmitter for my wife and they do not work so great so i thought since my car had a tape deck i would give this a try i was excited that i had all my ipod music with me but after less than a week it the sound started going down hill to a point where i couldn t listen anymore with it it is now in a landfill somewhere my guess is i will need a radio in the car that is ipod compatiable cable for now just have the radio and cds i burn 
chip failed maker replaced after i had shot and unloaded a few hundred photos it got so i couldn t shoot without getting either corrupted images or a refusal message from the camera i contacted kingston and they replaced the chip at no cost including postage meanwhile i bought a gb sandisk chip that has given no trouble and so far i haven t tested the new mb kingston chip 
sandisk gb i just cam from las vegas and the sandisk has a disk error that doesn t allow for more photos after only using mb i have tried to format the disk using the camera and through windows xp it doesn t allow it to be formatted bad investment would not recommend the product unless there is a way i can get a refund or an exchange 
bought a recertified e stopped working within hours i was very excited when i received this camera i liked it very much and thought i was getting a lot of camera for the money sure enough the pictures looked great very true color nice to handle black white setting it was a little heavy and uses those xd cards but overall i really liked it then within about three hours of owning it after less then ten pictures something had gone awry the zoom lens was stuck it wouldn t move and an error message kept appearing then the camera would shut off that s when i referenced the manual and found out that it wasn t a fixable error it had to be fixed by the manufacturer i guess i know why i couldn t find a new one on line and why there were so many refurbished i still really like fuji cameras but i wouldn t trust this model especially a recertified one i have since learned that i am not the only person who has found this out the hard way lucky i was able to return mine for a refund 
tilts in the hdmi socket and loses signal picked one of these up because it was a lot cheaper than buying a new dvi to hdmi cable bad idea ! the dvi cable screws into the adapter ok but the completed assembly is too big and hangs down from the hdmi socket i literally had to prop up the adapter behind the player with some magazines to keep it from tilting down and losing the signal save yourself some trouble and buy a an hdmi cable 
broke after months of use i spent on this and it broke after months i guess the old saying you get what you paid for is true 
ati products are not fully vista compatible i recently purchased this ati tv video card which clearly stated vista compatible the free in shipping remote is not compatible it took me three days for ati to admit that clearly the company engages in misleading advertising my recommendation do not buy ati products 
be very careful i was wrongly advised by tech support to buy this instead of waiting for a new supply of power supplies from voodoo be sure your computer is supported because targus tech won t give you any info about voltage amperage or wattage on this thing so you can t safely maake it work with an unsupported computer so amazon as usual graciously took it back love amazon i just now read the other reviews and now consider myself lucky i didn t keep it and try to make it work 
going downhill i find it strange that the memorex dvd rw reviews here are favorable while at the same time the memorex dvd rw reviews complain of bad media last year i bought memorex ram disk as well as memorex dvd rw disks for use with my toshiba d kr i believe i only had one bad disk out of or so that i used they lasted over a full year of through dozens and dozens of recordings and eventually degraded no complaints here and at that time i probably would have given them stars however i recently bought a pack of memorex dvd rw and only of formated hence the rating here i also recently bought a pack of fuji ram disk and the first two i tried did not work and failed several tries at formating unfortunately i bought these at best buy which are notarious for their lack of customer service and they refused to accept returns on these so what s going on here why are we letting these manufacturers get away with selling products that sometimes work in some machines and fail most of the time in others where s the six sigma attitude when you need it 
just plain bad reading erik mann s review above was just like living my own experience i bought these headphones for their noise canceling ability attractive price small package and easy folding capability all these features definitely get a big thumbs up from me the sound however is very disappointing i used these with my g ipod and took a good lot of time to try and adjust the sound various ways so i can enjoy it but to no avail the ipod stock earphones sound a lot better even on a plane if you lock them into your ear by twisting them so the pieces of wire shooting out of the ear buds points up towards your temples i guess i will just keep looking for better cans 
not what it s cracked up to be i bought this so i could print wireless from my laptop it didn t work i called hp tech support and after min they couldn t get it to work either and explained i would only be able to print not use bidirectional scanning from the printer to scanner and suggested i return it i bought it through amazon but it was shipped from tech depot an affiliated company of office depot and they said since i opened it that i could not return it how was i supposed to know it wouldn t work without opening i won t shop from office depot or tech depot again 
not for comcast motorola dvr users start off with the bad news i have a motorola dvr converter box with my comcast cable service and the comcast remote sends the ads box into gonzo fits attempting to use the menu button on the cable remote causes the ads box to switch inputs using the cable dvr fast forward button cycles the ads through screen formats with each button push etc i contacted ads tech service and they responded that the only fix was to physically separate the two boxes so the remotes could be aimed at one at a time obviously this is not acceptable too bad because this box does a much better job than my philips cineos at upscaling tivo analog cable dvd laserdisc all look better the improvement is more than worth the hassle of having another remote to handle but definitely not worth it if you have a motorola cable box that will conflict stars for video quality stars for user interface which is not so great subtract all but star for failure to publicise conflict and for failure to solve conflict 
a piece of garbage this was the worst electronics puchase i ve ever made when i first got the mini it was great looked nice and sounded great within about months battery life started to go way down after a year it was down to nothing didn t work properly would show a full charge and not last more than minutes if you re going to take a chance on an ipod definitely get a newer different model that may be of better quality than this one 
stay away i have x lite on writer and it keeps thrashing my writer drive when i insert this blank disk and it only writes up to then crashed ! i don t have this problem on other brand 
it will let you down there are many aspects of the t people want to count as negatives for me i consider them annoyances but not killers i would like to have wifi with my pda but i am not dead with out it more memory is always good but the t isn t on the hurting side it s not a good mp player with the memory it has and even if you have a g card with mp s it s not like this is what you would buy for mps but as far as contact information on the go applications etc i would consider this as good as any other the problem as i have just found out is these are known to die i haven t heard of this issue till it happened to me but it seems the t will at some point die it will lock up and even after all the resets listed from palm it will not come back to even a factory state you will have a palm powered logo screen with a small black line flashing on the top there are a couple of fixes if you are under warranty you can send it back to palm for them to make it better or you can remove the battery and solder it back this is a serious design issue that palm is more than happy to charge you for until i ran into this i would have rated this a until this happened the device did what i expected it to do i read the box before buying it and knew it had some lack of cool factor with the no wifi but it has one of the fastest processors available at that time in a pda which was a different type of cool the bluetoothworks well enough i haven t had any issues with it you can surf the net with bluetooth so wifi isn t really that big of a deal but if you can t trust your device is going to be working the next day it reallydoesn t matter what cool feature it has this has been a very expensive let down i don t want to buy another palm after this experience but i am not sure what toswitch to 
inventory number problem cobra hg a high gear cb antenna has an item model number hg a and the cobra hg a high gear cb antenna has an item model number hg a so clearly it seems the inventory numbers are erroneously swapped called two weeks ago no fix and called today hopefully it s corrected since i can t settle with the lower wattage rated antenna 
delivery of the product we did not have all the mounting screws hardware in the delivered box i had to call the manufacture who responded right away and mailed us missing parts but they were not correct and complete very frustrating 
amazon inventory control this product has a known defect for serial numbers r and less see logitech website i just received my amazon order and it was serial number r it will be sent back tomorrow hopefully amazon will cleanse its inventory on its own rather than relying on its customer base 
why isn t no stars an option terrible terrible terrible ok if all you want is a small spotlight or a nightlight i wasted money on buying two of these bulbs that i will never use ! i do want to see better led samples in the marketplace but this one has got to go too bad i didn t check the reviews on amazon before spending over bucks on two lightbulbs ! i m an idiot 
hum noise it makes a low humming noise if you listen loud enough you won t hear it but at low volume it s annoying also when it is off then you still hear the hum 
paint wears off keys after months of use just like others have stated the paint comes off the keys after a few months of use you would think logitech would have made a better product 
noise maker one month in the wall and sounds like a expresso machine my car s engine sounds better don t waste your money i called sharp and they say is the fan great maybe i should remove it and use ice cubes 
poorly described the lptodigital recording system is nothing more than a record player just a vanilla run ofthemill record player you still need a sound card in order to record your lps most builtin on the motherboard sound cards have very poor audio input so this product is not suited to its advertized function i am reminded of the solar clothes dryer product of a couple of years back the box contained a rope and some clothespins the software is awkward and hard to use not at all intuitive it also requires the user to register on the net and donate their privacy any buyer would be better off getting audacity freely available on the net which is easy to use and has the same features i do not recommend this product 
disparate cord length more than irritating i read all of the reviews here and thought these would be the best option for easy transport and low ambient sound i pod headpohones without breaking the bank im on a plane frequently i wanted something that i wouldn t cry over breaking or losing during my many travels i found that the uneven cord lengths are very irritating especially if you like to use only one plug like maybe at your desk at work the weight of the shorter cord pulls on the longer cord and it is quite uncomfortable even when sitting still so then i thought these will be great workout headphones wont be upset if i break or lose them however the cords produce noise in the ear pieces everytime they rub on your clothing or your hand the effect is very loud and disruptive to your music listening experience even when you are sitting stationary at your desk it is similar to wearing a stethescope which defeats the point of wearing in theear headphones which are supposed to reduce the ambient noise i do not recommend these headphones because of this stethescope effect i could get over the uneven cord lengths for certain uses they are after all designed to wear behind the head i m on the hunt for better quality headphones 
unreliable with the dinovo cordless media bluetooth desktop logitech has produced a product with a sleek appearance the product looks sharp and the mouse has a nice hand feel the mouse has a rechargeable battery and comes with a recharging cradle so the disappointment of finding a dead battery in your cordless mouse has been relegated to the old days when the product works there is a noticeable lag between keyboard entry or mouse movement and a response on the screen surprisingly the lag time seems to be greater for this bluetooth device than my older non bluetooth cordless desktop but it is not so long as to make the product unusable however this product has two fatal flaws first as other reviewers have found my experience with the dinovo is that it crashes constantly secondly logitech is no help whatsoever with this product a keyboard and mouse that work less than of the time is simply not acceptable for my needs bottom line is this product didn t even help my clutter problem on my desk because my corded keyboard and corded mouse have to sit right next to the computer for rapid access whenever this product decides to stop working this product is troublesome unreliable and decidedly not recommended 
excellent sound bad design as most anyone will tell you these speakers do have excellent sound and if you re just going to set them up on your desktop then i d give them stars however the design for wall mounting these is horrible and you can t ceiling mount them logitech does not make separate mounts for these and no universal speaker mounts will work with them if you want to see how they mount go to logitech s website go to product support and enter wall mounting some might argue that they re computer speakers not home entertainment center speakers but for i expect a little bit better design 
horrible use of battery power purchase not recommended this would be a great wireless mouse if it weren t for it s battery usage it runs on dual aaa batteries they need replacing about every weeks i do not recommend this mouse instead of adding to my large collection of aaa batteries i m purchasing another mouse that handles battery usage efficiently 
i don t like this item from blueproton i don t like blueproton because they sent me a defective item and i have to pay the return shipping fee i like amazon because they refund me whole the payment otherwise blueproton would not refund me the shipping fee which is more expensive than the price of item 
serviceable but not worth the money the sound quality is fine if you are in range the dual headsets work as advertised in other words you cannot talk on both phones at the same time instead you can transfer a call to the other phone the range is not great though i have no complaints with the sound quality when in range of about ft the voicemail alert system sometimes indicates voicemail even though you have none other than that it s a phone that only needs one phone cord and works for a small household 
works ok but no wonder i ve had several upss now for a while belkin ups quit after about years of work i understand that this may be long enough but i have several from apc and they are still working one ups i think now has been in service or years 
flimsy is an understatement dvds stored on this shelf would get seasick the whole thing wobbles like crazy wood is okay but materials that hold the wood together are terrible don t buy even for the low price 
it s a no show for days well i can t give an honest review of this product because i haven t yet received it i ordered it on june and it was promised by amazon direct not another seller via amazon between june and june so i m sitting here on july with no tv it really isn t amazon s fault it s the shipper eagle but whatever i m less than satisfied with this amazon com transaction i have seen the tv in stores and it looks good though 
doesnt work dont waste your time or money on this the sound quality was poor and i had to turn up the volume on the receiver so loud just to be able to hear it on the wireless speaker which defeated the whole purpose after an hour of adjusting and re adjusting i packed it back up and sent it back 
no vista support returned it wouldn t work with vista and a canon mp and it certainly won t work with mac os x clients note the product doesn t advertise support for mac why is it so difficult for manufacturers to create a wireless print server that works with multifunction printers 
temporary device i would only recommend this product if you need something that only lasts six months there is a reason the warranty is only days the performance sound quality steadily declines over time the ihome worked great when it was new but it won t play songs from the ipod anymore and the radio is a static box 
a piece of garbage four months after purchase the receiver misfunction and shut down it was impossible to contact sherwood electronics which had no service centers in the state of wisconsin therefore the warranty was not worth the piece of paper it was written on check out a sherwood service center in your state prior to purchase 
unreliable requires frequent reboots after just one week of use and installing the newest firmware this router began showing sickly signs requiring a daily reboot by week two it began needing to be rebooted every minutes this now seems typical of previous experiences i have had with other netgear products so much for plug and play my recommmendation leave netgear to the passive routers and use another brand for firewalls and dhcp serving 
don t waste your money you don t need a tool to open a cd easily as a musician who s dealt w opening many cd packages for many years let me save you some money you don t need a special tool to open cds just run the bottom edge of the cd against any solid rough surface like a sidewalk or concrete wall a couple of times the plastic wrapping will break up easy as pie allowing you to take it off effortlessly getting that pesky sticker that seals the top of the cd off is easy too again no tools required you ll notice that the cd cover is hinged at the top bottom in such a way that you can easily slide the front cover off the back it just pops in out held in place by a little bump on one piece that fits in a hole in the other gently pull the front cover out of its sockets at the top bottom then bend the whole thing back toward the top of the cd case where the sticker is affixed so that the sticker becomes straightened out this will let you easily pull off the sticker in one piece try peeling the front cover off the sticker rather than vice versa and you re done ! all you have to do now is just pop the front cover back into its hinges and enjoy the whole process takes under a minute and you ll still have the money in your pocket that you didn t spend on an iffy cd opening tool to buy another cd with 
unable to use i do not know if it is defective but we were disappointed to find that this item does not work with any of our equipment 
unsatisfactory vga image i bought the cables to go usb kbm switch to replace a d link kvm that had failed this port authority kvm has neat features autoswitching switchable usb hub auto conversion of usb on all connected pcs to work with ps keyboard and mouse but it delivers a poor image on my vga monitor my hp f plasma display s image is fuzzy and has ghost images ive not yet determined whether the poor image results from the kvm switch itself or from the kvm topc cables that accompanied the unit either way i wouldn t purchase this product again 
panasonic has unresolved error f issues with this system beware of this product ! as soon as i put the system together and tried to put in a dvd the display showed f and the player would not close apparently my problem is far from unique according to a internet search on f many people have experienced the this error code with their panasonic home theater units and other panasonic produsts which indicates a faulty or shorted out power supply every time the unit powers on i get the error message sometimes the f problem takes a year to show up so i guess i am lucky that my system was broken from the beginning at least i can return it check them out for yourselves with the better business bureau panasonic has an unsatisfactory rating based on excessive unresolved product quality and repair complaints from what i ve read so far panasonic is not helpful in trying to resolve this i returned my system to amazon and will be purchasing a different brand 
made in china look elsewhere the highest volume setting is barely audible the options are limited more profit for an american company at the expense of americans 
horrible software installation express install is over mb full install about mb it requires you to upgrade to internet explorer to continue installation how it this related to printer installation and what if i don t use internet explorer i do not install takes forever is memory hog then tries to sign you up for some services i used to like hp printers i m completely disappointed with the software to the point that i would rather have other printer than deal with this type of software 
terrible support i contacted linksys to determine the best product to purchase to improve signal coverage in home network first tried extender and should have listened to others who rated it poorly on amazon it was worthless then purchased the wapag at linksys advice i set up fine but could not get access to the internet once i connected to the wap support basically just said it won t work with the wrtg router this company is the worst i would not purchase linksys in the future 
product known bad by manufacturer i purchased a copy of magellan worldwide basemap i installed it in my computer but it would not run when this also happened to a second computer i installed it on i contacted magellan technical support after asking me about the relative positions of stickers on the back of the cd jewel case i was told i had a defective disk and was offered a replacement in to weeks ! since i will have returned from my trip to europe before the replacement arrives the product is totally useless to me don t buy this product until they have good disks available the good ones have the stickers on the back of the jewel case in an l configuration on the bad disks the stickers are parallel 
not for ipod with video the new ipods do not have the connections to work with firewire so this cable will only charge the new ipods with video besides this this is a good product for the ipods 
not what expected my nec tube tv of years went on the blink again i ve had it reparied a few times for here there and pondered replacing it with another tube tv like sony trinitron or samsung for but then i saw this sylvania hdtv for and thought it was time to move up to high tech for a few dollars more i ordered it and received great service with quick day delivery however i was immediately dissapointed with the picture quality much worse then my old tv of years but i still had hope because i was still waiting for my hd cable box after days i got my hd cable box installed and while i saw a big improvement it was still not the quality picture i expected so from about a repair of my old tv to new tube tv to hdtv i returned the sylvania hdtv and ordered a samsung hdtv lnss form amazon and am very pleased with this new tv great picture in hd and digital plus happier with the larger screen 
garbage if i had three arms maybe four this would have been easy to put up as i have only two it was a nightmare each section warps as the screws are tightened so getting each subsequent section level and nested neatly inside the previously mounted section is very difficult on second thought even if i had more arms than a hindu deity i would still dislike this product the inside of the channel has ledges in it to hold the screws in place these ledges catch on cables which the user adds or removes after the unit is mounted i gave up on trying to remove an rca cable from the unit and just cut the darned thing rather than trying to feed it through the channel i wish i could recommend a better wall mounted cable management unit if i find one i ll amend this review to include it save your money buy something else 
no handle nice product before they decided to save a few pennies i have purchased seven but now it is made with out the handle so if that was part of the atraction of this case note that the discription says sturdy padded handle not stars if it still had the handle or if you don t need one 
do not buy i bought this hub less than months ago it has stopped working ! if i plug it in it is no longer powered do not buy this p os 
very poor technical support my tv started to have sound problems and i sent off an email to olevia no response then tried calling support had to leave a message days later after no response i called and transferred to sales helpful guy and wanted all the details but again he could not help and would have tech support call me back no luck with call back weeks go by and now i am getting rather ticked at the no response so rewrote email again no response called tech support and left my number no response again called sales and got another person got a live body yaaahoo ! could not help but forwarded me to customer service to give me the service at home number customer service could not help and said tech support were the ones to talk to after an hour plus on hold i get to talk to a tech hour later he came to the conclusion that i needed service the support issue is really bad my recomendation is call them yourself before you buy the tv oh and good luck 
vicks ultrasonic humidifiers aren t what they re cut out to be i recently purchased vicks ultrasonic humidifiers in jan and received them by the rd week of jan on feb having used them only weeks one of them stopped putting out the humidifying vapor i followed the manual s instructions to the letter by cleaning the tank with bleach and the base i used vinegar to clean what white dust if any since i m using the cartridge it might have having followed the manual instructions to the letter the humidifier turns on but there is no mist coming out of the mist nozzle i plan in contacting the manufacturer for a replacement or refund good luck to those of you who are considering in purchasing a vicks ultrasonic humidifier ! 
holux gpslim is junk i bought this device and it worked great for about days it would connect to the satellites quickly and held a long charge after the first days the bluetooth light barely ever comes on and if it does it may never full initialize or turn back off within a few seconds buy something better this unit is not worth your time or money 
unsatisfied this product is unstable i have spent numerous hours on the phone with belkin tech support to no avail one time they left me on the phone on hold for over three hours i need to pack these items up and mail them back or to belkin gladwin baile

cheap is the word if you want cheap speaker stands these are the ones to buy however if you expect to move them reguarly like to vacuum around them i davoid them the spikes break off easily leaving you with a cockeyedspeaker 
cheap product is cheap and of poor manufacture routinely causes my ipod to disconnect and reconnect to my computer at the slightest bump of my ipod potentially leading to data loss avoid 
sony cd cdp cx had this model above for years started skipping during playing any cd not scratched my cx model is years old and works great when you check the sony site for service if not under warranty it s about bucks for an exchange and for service i sure would like to know what s the problem with these don t exchange ! buy a new one for about and smash the old one make sure you video it and post on youtube 
very poor performance i bought this product and i wish i had not in most cases it is much faster and efficient to copy the text by typing than trying to scan it you will only get a headache 
nice user interface but not reliable palms have nice user interfaces this is my second palm pda the screen is excellent and it is thin and light the software works well and synchronizes without problems to windows xp home and xp professional unfortunately after two years the on off switch has failed this requires me to use one of the hot buttons to turn it on this allows me to continue to use this device but it is annoying and inconvenient these are all about convenience right my first palm device an m also had its on off switch fail after two years before its main board failed palm needs to understand that i have other things to do with my money than to spend every two years on a pda because they didn t make the on off switch robust enough one should want to buy a new pda because of new features and design not because of mechanical failure this device has been well taken care of and has not been abused my wife s treo p had its speaker fail after days and occasionally the phone portion requires a reset although i have not had any problems with palm software my it consultant tells me that the palm software does not synchronize well with the windows tablet operating system although i would have liked to stay with the palm os because of the mechanical failures of my two palms and the treo p my next pda will probably be from hp 
just smears dirt around to start off with it s hard to start the wipes through the hole in the cap you have to take the cap off and then take the foil seal off then you find the start of the roll it s glued down like the start of a roll of toilet paper they say you are supposed to start in the middle of the roll but i couldn t find the middle then you have to feed the wipes up through four very tough plastic tabs in the cap the only problem is the hole is small and tabs are not very flexable i was honestly afraid my finger was going to get stuck in the hole it didn t i think the safest way to do it is to use a pencil or pen to start them with once i did get them started the tabs are so inflexable that the first sheet just tore in half no matter how carefully i pulled on it so i took the cap back off started the next sheet this one came out in one piece and tore off the roll before the next sheet started through the hole grrr ok forget feeding the sheets through the hole i just take the sheets straight off the roll so now i clean my computer monitor which is pretty dirty its in a room with smokers i can clearly see that it s just smearing things around i check the sheet itself it looks clean still i sit and watch as this filmy substance dries on my screen with very pronounced very visable streaks i try another sheet still got streaks from hell a third sheet later i can t seem to make the streaks disappear they only move around i say forget it and clean my moniter the old way i say forget this stuff it s junk save your money 
don t do it don t buy it in the months i had the phone the screen burnt out so i can see the numbers the answering machine is horrible and i get better reception from my baby monitor i had a cheap panasonic beforehand which was much better this was a complete waste of hooking it up to your pc to get those cool features is just a pain i m having a tough time returning this be careful 
re absolutely terrible to celebrate the anniversary of our company we thought we d give all employees a gift our apple phobic it guys nixed the ipod as a choice despite the ceo and cto both owning and recommending them so we went with the zune of the we bought had to be exchanged for quality issues we ve had issues with the drivers on the vista enabled computers and spotty syncing with the xp machines several of the units have had poor performing batteries and several also had a buzz in the headphones we can t use them as data drives so they re not as useful as we d like finally store interoperability is zero and we cannot understand why drm is applied to files if you share them which reminds me the wireless is half baked too slow and we ve had plenty of hang ups while trying to share the end of the story is that the ceo is both pissed and embarrassed as to the gift debacle he has already said in no uncertain terms that when apple ships a video ipod the company will give those to make up for the zune experience 
waste of money i bought of those to present to someone as a gift but i am really disappointed with this item not clear reception with too much of static do not waste yoour money in this item 
garbage stopped working after months of extremely gentle use i never even traveled with it it just stopped working completely making me lose data never again i ll buy anything from this company this drive is a piece of rubbish ! 
please read this before you invest your cash in this product first off let me state for the record that i only buy sony but i have toadvise you against the purchase of the bean walkman i purchased one in march and returned it september as i had purchased replacementinsurance and was able to return it because it broke it is hard to turn off and the usb port cover always pops open not to mention the headphonesalways pull out the fm receiver is hard tune in the daylight as the screen is invisiable save your self the hassel

telezpper tz dosn t work still receving lots of auto dialer calls waste of money 
not as advertised the description gives the impression that the material is made of hard rubber and that it can protect you ipod in rugged conditions in reality it is made from very thin flimsy rubber i suppose will protect you nano from scratches and other cosmetic damage but it will not porvide any protection from drops or other rough handling 
very poor performance quality is ok for antenna but design just does not work glass mounts just don t provide any xmit power go magnetic mount you ll be much happier 
using this power supply with a radio i read the other reviews before i purchased this power supply the one review stated that for short wave radio use the power supply created significant interference but for fm use it was probably fine most of our use is for fm so i purchased the power supply locally our town is considered to be radio free our experience is that for the one strong local radio station reception overpowered the interference for the rest of the stations there was significant interference we ve opted to not use the power supply when we are listening to the stationswe want to listen to and just decided to send the power supply back the package clearly states in the first note do not use this ac adaptor with a radio as it may cause some noises information on web did not sufficiently declare this weakness 
do not buy this brand sent item back to the company and got a rejected mail saying company out of business return to sender the company address on the label is recoton accessories inc lake emma roadlake mary fl made in chin 
unreliable this printer is capable of producing high quality documents but it frequently jams and requires surgery through the back door to get out tiny scraps of paper often i have to lift open the top door to get at the ink injector which gets hung up with paper also the printer crimps the top left corner of every document the scanner function works well and i have had no problems there the fax capability is poorly laid out and has never worked overall whatever cost you pay is not worth the frustration i would spend my money elsewhere 
don t be fooled by the mah rating i bought a couple of these nikon en elkonica minolta np equivalent batteries for my konica minolta a camera their performance is simply terrible the oem np rated at mah can take photos but the sterlingtek can only take a few dozens i didn t bother to return them because of the hassle and shipping charges if you want to use third party batteries try lenmar or ultralast i have used them on my sony alpha a and panasonic lumix lx the performance has been great from these brands 
unreliable cute design bad engineering poor quality control my shuffle suffered the blinking green orange lights so i took it into the apple store a salesman took minutes to figure out that he couldn t do anything and said i would have to sign up for a appointment at the genius bar at that appointment the genius said he couldn t fix it and because he said he didn t know anything about engineering he couldn t say whether the shuffle was not working because of a software or a hardware problem or both apparently being an apple genius doesn t involve understanding how things work though it does appear to require having a trendy haircut the genius then offered a discount on the purchase of a new shuffle but couldn t answer the question of why anyone would want to waste money on such a poorly designed thing perhaps it should be retitled the idiot bar 
amazon needs packing lessons what can you say about cd cases these would be adequate if they hadn t arrived damaged whoever does the packing for amazon should learn that a single sheet of brown paper will not prevent shipping damage a little bubble wrap may be more expensive but it would have prevented my returning this order for a refund 
after a year s use not a keeper i was given the ique m for christmas of a few months into the new year i dropped it onto pavement and it broke for garmin replaced it with a refurbished unit which i consider a fair price unfortunately the refurb unit couldn t play directions at full volume so i returned it for another refurb this unit fell off the windshield still in it s cradle and it started making that frying sound of short circuits i called garmin and was told that if there was no obvious damage to the unit they d look at it under warranty i had told the guy what happened so i was pleasantly surprised they did in fact replace it under all circumstances the report you get back says the returned unit was within specifications or words to that effect even though clearly not i have no idea why units will be returned with new software keys to enter and the software will begin urging you to register even though you already have for some the mapping software on the m will appear crippled it is a basic drive from here to there unit it does not allow you to load way points points of interest and the like each of the units had quirks on the first one every time i inserted the sd card with maps windows player or whatever it s called would start up and ask me if i wanted to search the card for tunes the second one had inaudible volume the fourth one has a problem common to the first one the brightness resets itself randomly to zero yep zero the first one left the powered brightness full on so you could give power and see to reset the battery brightness to half on but this one resets them both to zero so you may think the unit is not turning on but it s on you just can t see anything on the screen if you re outside you can put it in the sun and see dimly enough to navigate to the brightness setting but if it s dark you need a flashlight the current one will do a hard reset if i start the car with the unit plugged into the lighter and sometimes when i put it in the cradle this means i have to do the full new user routine touch the screen on the little plus signs to register the touch screen press and hold to learn again how to copy press and hold to learn again how to paste reset the time from olathe kansas to where i live all contacts notes calendars and other information is lost all preferences are gone after i ve gone through the restart routine the unit will then find the satellites and get me where i m going but i can t load destinations from contacts as they re gone so i have to type them all in by hand if the battery runs out of juice the unit is dead it forgets everything and i have to touch the screen where the plus signs are to register the screen press and hold to learn again how to copy press and hold to learn again how to paste reset the time from olathe kansas to where i live all contacts notes calendars and other information is lost all preferences are gone i complained about this to support at garmin and i was assured this is a microsoft feature and that garmin can do nothing about it they recommended that i buy a program from one of several vendors that backs up the data to an sd card where it will not be lost so now i carry a card with my detailed maps and a card with my backup data i did learn though that if the battery runs down the backup program is lost so you can t retrieve your data from the backup sd card unless you have told the program to save as self extracting archives i learned it the hard way of course to restore i pop out the detailed maps sd card insert the backup card navigate to the file explorer navigate to the sd card open the contents of the sd card select the latest back up click through the restore procedure click to ok that it has finished just a minute or two with my small amount of data click to restart wait a long time for it to restart tap to get past the owner data screen enter the password then pop the restore card out reinstall the map card wait while it reads it then i m good to go i can t do it while i m driving of course so if the unit resets on its own i just go with the complete lack of contacts and without the unit knowing where home is which means i have to type it or other locations into the where to dialogue the unit defaults to d directions instead of north is always up which is confusing for me as i can t look at the screen and out my window and make immediate sense of where i am vis avis the map i m sure this is my shortcoming and i then have to remember how to navigate the menu to the setting for north is up which i can t do while driving it also defaults to different displays for day and night the night display uses a dark background and i have found that the menus for the windows programs use a transparent background with black text so i can t read the menu selections against the dark display and the unit will not save my preference for using day at all times if i lose power or the unit resets when i start the car or sometimes when i put it in the cradle on the contacts database the unit assumes all phone numbers start with the area code to olathe kansas it also formats all numbers as us numbers i have a few overseas numbers and they are crammed into the xxx xxx xxxx format even though they are longer and don t start with an area code in the calendar if i have meetings scheduled outside my time zone i enter them at the time they re scheduled then when i get there i have the option of choosing the visited time zone and all the times are screwed up as the unit assumes all times entered are for my original time zone so i never use the visited time zone feature and the unit assumes i m still in my home zone wherever i may travel i have not found a way to have it tell me how to get to places that have no street address but for which i have the lat long coordinates i camp in places that are off main roads and trying to move the map around gets to be burdensome at the scale necessary to show unpaved roads i quickly lose where i am and have to zoom out which loses the road on the whole the directions part of the m is excellent it gives good directions has reasonably up to date maps and lets you find stores restaurants gas stations hotels and the like in your area and it provides addresses and phone numbers so you can call ahead for information and reservations on the whole using the device is too aggravating to make it a keeper after a year of use i can t put up with it anymore i ll take garmin s word that this is all a shortcoming of windows mobile and not garmin s fault but i can t put up with it anymore i ll switch to magellan or tomtom or some other unit that isn t windows based and that doesn t completely lose its mind when the battery runs down doesn t randomly do a hard reset doesn t randomly set the brightness to zero and doesn t assume all phone numbers start with the area code to olathe kansas maybe another manufacturer will let me import pois and way points from other people s files 
well built poorly suited i purchased this game pad due to good reviews found it online for with free shipping so had to try myself its true its built well and pretty comfortable in the hand the programming software is alright as well not as nice asthe nostromo n software for example but what i didnt like about it was much more relavant firstly there is a toggle lock shift button this button is easy to press by accident and since it is nota momentary button you have to go back and press it off agian interupting game play also buttons and are not paddles but rather thumb and quite far from normal thumb use i had a hard time using those buttons quickly also the toggle and digital buttons cant be mapped for other uses so your limited to total buttons rather than and finally for some reason there was no way to invoke fight in nhl i couldnt live with that so i had to ship it back and ill soon go with the logitech 
major design flaws buy kensington version instead i purchased this product but after months of frustrating use wound up throwing it away the first problem is that the structural support of the power tips between the laptop plug and the cord plug is the electrical solder ! the effect of this is that if you use the adapter on the road where it s subject to a lot of plug and unplug and varying mechanical stress the solder breaks you then at best have a tip with an intermittent connection i replaced the tip twice before giving up and getting another better designed adapter the second problem is that when i unplugged the power adapter from the wall it would cause my laptop ibm t to emergency power off unplugged at the laptop plug was fine i understand this to be an issue between the t power system and a surge issue in the adapter i replaced this with a kensington w adapter it looks almost like the same product same oem except they have stronger power tips it also didn t have the power off issue i loved the form factor but the product just didn t work 
they didnt last for days this product costs too much for being such poor quality i can literally just pull the cord apart bare handed without using barely any force at all and after it s torn apart there is no hope of repairing it no matter how much time effort and thought you put into it it s impossible i m pretty sure that it s inability to be repaired is just a marketing ploy so you will buy another the only good qualities these earphones have is their sound quality and their comfort the sound quality sounds a little better than the normal ipod earphones and you can keep them in your ears for a very long time without your ears getting sore but if you plan on using these while you re leading a busy active life i guarantee that they wont last a week i heard that these earphones are the best i found out that they are indeed some of the worst and sadly i found that out the hard way 
a sheep in wolfs clothing yes this monitor has all the big tech numbers whatever they mean to me that doesn t mean squat when it s not pleasing to the eye the colors on the screen are not consistent it s brighter on the bottom then on the top if you look at it while moving your head up and down you ll see it change that s why you get a difference when you re looking at it straight on the new cheaper tn panels they re using have a different viewing angle than previous ones a lot of the monitors the electronics stores sell are of this type the display models are deceiving because they run a video loop that makes the picture look beautiful but when you get it home and start running your apps on it that s when you start seeing the flaws also this model has an annoying blinking blue light when it s in sleep mode 
misleading prior eton e review just received radio yesterday and am returning radio today ! pluses adequate lcd display and good illumination while on ac adapter good thumbwheel tuning in khz increments adequate speaker fidelity for small radio however the volume slew buttons have set numbered volume levels and between settings of there is a big noticeable increase in volume not good and while tuning shortwave bands every approx khz increment there appears to be a null area where signal meter reads a signal received but quiet speaker also on fm if hands are near the radio the signal breaks up for weaker signals not strong ones and compared to my grundig pe which i feel the sensitivity is not good and the hiss is bothersome the eton e seems worse still i am returning this today and obtaining the sony gr instead eton e not bad but certainly not worth stars or above especially if comparing it to another similar size radio and then comparing it to my sony 
junk this is the worst pice of electronics i ever bought started falling apart after few days only battery life is a joke software that comes with it is totally unfriendly and even if you manage to install that thing on your computer it won t work with os prior to xp you will find that out after you re done installing it mediocre performance don t waste your money on this one 
is slightly better than old one the sound on the sennheiser phone changes a lot sometimes the music is loud and sometimes low the volume knob is not that good the only good thing is that it partially stays in your ear i cut off one piece because the two different cord lengths were annoying 
caveat emptor i cannot speak for all devices but this was a total failure in my case i am a fast typist and it seemed that about of the keystrokes were not picked up by my treo this was simply unacceptable so i immediately returned it i cannot determine whether the problem was due to the keyboard the software or my old pda newer faster pdas might have a better success rate but the potential for problems will still be there my suggestion is to buy this somewhere with a generous return policy so that you can return it if it is a mismatch for your pda 
tryed everthing can t get it to work i have tried everything and i can t get this to work i have called the number to ask them but everytime i get put on hold and it is costing me for the phone call sit on hold finally get frustrated and hang up if anyone knows how i can get it to work i am sure i would like it right now all it does is sit there 
do not work as well as promised i live in washington dc so i generally get a signal when outdoors using these headphones did not yield an increased signal for me 
price is right but that s all i thought because these are gumy headphones they would be comfortable but they are not they hurt my ears as much as any other if ear pain is your problem when you wear ear buds then don t get these 
wrong item twice ordered an antenna the middle of nov received wrong item with in days i let them aware of problem then i mailed back wrong item within days i received duplicate of wrong item after i emailed them to let them know of problem i heard nothing i had to send an ugly email stating whats up they cancelled my order then refunded original amount charged to credit card plus cents still fighting for them to reimburse me for my cost to send back wrong items 
not fit for purpose i will not bother repeating the specific complaints of numerous reviewers in general this product should not even be sold it is not a real nas in any meaningful sense of the word there would be similar value in simply getting a usb attached hard drive since it is not as if a sonos or anything else could access it no real sharing get a real product i am embarassed for the retailers who actuallly sell this product it was the only nas available at the nearby office depot which is why i have this glorified doorstop as soon as i get my buffalo linkstation running again my fault that i bricked it not buffalo s i will happily be taking this thing off my network and out of my life it doesn t even support filename lengths permitted by windows or linux it really is an unbelievably poor product 
incredible rip off list price over actual price you ve got to be kidding ! i never accuse companies of raping consumers because we are free to choose what we buy and how much we spend but this smells of taking advantage of consumer ignorance if you want to connect your ipod to your home stereo get a stereo mini plug to rca plug y adapter at radio shack that s all you need because you already have a recharger it came with your ipod the only additional capability this kit provides is holding your ipod upright i have this item it came free with my gb ipod and although it offers a slight convenience over not having it the price is a terrible rip off 
thumbs down the product could not be used with my rather standard setup ie macosx on apple g with a pioneer burner i was told by the vendor that i might get it to work by downloading software from the web it turned out that the download was not a simple everyday variety but required a sophistication beyond my modest abilities my local apple vendor and repair facility advised me not to use the download they did not want to try it as well the product vendor was reluctant to provide a refund i might add that they dragged their feet for over about a two month period eventually they said they would provide a refund less a restocking fee i put the issue in dispute with mc 
avoid this product i ve always had issues with this product since i bought it on amazon i ve updated the firmwares for both the router and the card but the problems persist the problems are inconsistent internet connection its easy to isolate since i can connect my workstation directly to the router modem and when i do my connection is normali ve since travelled a lot and didn t have time to give this back be warned 
beware if buying this in s f bay area and you use comcast the reason is this product isn t listed in the comcast list of tv s that they can program their remote to what that means is you have to use two remotes and if this isn t bad enough when you call comcast up to get a signal they won tcant do it so here s where i am now and i ve had the tv for about two weeks now no picture after watching a dvd i m unable to switch it back to tv mode because there s no companion remote to do it on after several long minutes with the comcast tech trying to get her to just send me a signal i couldn t take it anymore i asked for a tech to come to the house and got an appointment for so another week goes by with no picture the screen tells me no signal after a few seconds of this message it flashes to please scan channels 
no usb capabilities where is the usb compatibility that all the other cards have 
cx epson printer and ink cartridges i ve had epson c c and cx printers and they all have the same problems ink catridges that don t work or tell me the right amount is left in the cartridge ! printer dies due to ink cartridge failures robert f 
only bought because imation sonix stopped making their label no where near as easy to use as my old system but with trial and error can have a decent amount of control over your projects but one interesting thing someone mentioned earlieris that regardless of with system you use these labels can alterthe way dvds play making them stick and freeze and wondering if its the disks burner or what after some experimenting i didconfirm that it was actually the labels i was having so much fun making it might be the weight but i think its possibly the way the beam shines through the disc and reflects off the white label backing dunno but if you all of a sudden start having problems try a labeling tape or a sharpie 
don t bother i owned this system for months the single worst home electronics investment i ve made in years the dvd player choked on brand new dvd s constantly cannot read disc or min pauses ruined more family movie nights than i can recall i couldn t get bose customer support to respond to me ever it s exapandability and connectivity are miniscule it was not even possible to buy a functioning dvd player to plug into it and salvage the investment the surround sound is a joke but i never realized it till i replaced it with a real system seriously don t even think about it friends don t let friends buy bose 
they send the wrong antenna i ordered the cobra hg a high gear cb antenna they keep sending the cobra hg a now i m stuck with a antenna i did not order nor do i want 
creative labs gigaworks s piece thx speaker system total waste of money unless the only thing you want to do with this system is connect it to another creative labs product like one of their pc cards this system cannot be connected with anything else be warned 
a waste of money this factory refurbished model gps worked for about ten hours initially it worked fine it then failed to pick up the satellite signal or would loose the signal as a drove along on a trip i called tech support for help twice the service personnel are very difficult to understand and they also have trouble understanding me it is a language issue they suggested various tests and reprogramming but it did not correct the problem the unit was fifteen days past the day warrantee so they wanted me to ship back the unit and charge me to examine it i can t afford to pour any more money down that hole for ten hours of service stay away from the refurbished unit and don t buy a new unit without an extended warrantee 
poor quality this is the third delphi product i have purchased for use with xm skyfi system each delphi product had to be returned because of problems sound card problem antenna connection would not maintain contact with signal etc the sound was very good when the systems were working the purpose of buying the portable units was to use the skyfi outside of the home i gave up on the portable systems and now have the home kit for skyfi connection to my home stereo system so far so good i have had it hooked up and working one week 
wire broke good customer service i gave this as a gift to my in laws i was so embarrassed the wire broke the very first time it was used but after i posted the review the company emailed me and promised to replace any faulty parts they seem very determined to stand behind the quality of their product i will update this review when the replacement parts arrive 
unacceptable trash the button that sets the clock in and out of daylight savings time is right on top of the clock and is activated by a single touch so you re fumbling for the snooze button and surprise you instead set the clock off daylight savings time you ll get a rude surprise the next morning when you re an hour late for work sony should know better than this much better now i have to go to the trouble of sending the blasted thing back to amazon 
be careful of remanufactured equipment the multifunction center worked correctly for exactly one week then it developed a loud grinding sound so much for buying remanufactured equipment spend a little more and buy something new 
don t buy if you own an intel mac after i purchased and opened this product i have found that macally does not offer updated drivers for intel based macs buyers beware this will not work with your intel based mac 
does not work sony disc player does not work it won t recognize disc in player currently trying to get it serviced under warranty 
did not see any difference i did not see any picture quality improvement using this high priced monster cable i get the same quality pictures from my cable bought from biglots so purchased a hdmi cable but believe me the picture quality from my cheap component cable is still good eventhough hdmi pictures are little better when i compared with the pictures from hdmi cable 
sucky this dvd player was fine for the first few months that i had it but then it started not recognizing disks and now it won t recognize any disks also it rattled so it is a piece of sh 
throw away player bought it played a dvd on it for hours and the unit failed other dvd players in the house have had no problems at all and have worked non stop for years save yourself time and money purchase a quality item instead of this throw away player 
windows step down this os is worse more bugs than a jungle i am incredibly upset with my purchase of the archos out of the box this pseudo entertainment center rocked and did everything it was supposed to but about a month into the purchase loomed a very ugly problem cut to the chase this product is horrible if it s not suffering from one malfunction it will invent another i ve had so many corrupt files that i might blow my brains out for whatever reason this device likes to shut down in the middle of transferring to and from the computer making it impossible to get a whole song on much less a whole album ah but it gets worse you only think it s working when all of a sudden it just freezes ! why i have no clue ! it takes forever to load all my songs because it uses a hard drive it takes forever to find a song because the hard drive slows down when you try to file through songs and it takes forever to get used to the horrible buttons on the side half the time i press the wrong button and then my song ends and i can t get the hard drive to load it back up ! it drives me absolutely crazy besides the horrible layout of the buttons the speaker is next to worthless if you crank up the volume all the way the speaker fizzles and gives you a horrible mess of a noise the only good thing is that the clarity of the screen is fantastic it makes my images look crystal clear and my hd videos look as good as my hdtv that is if you can get the confounded thing to actually play my videos maybe i got a dud and i haven t tried contacting archos but i will asap i thought i should let everyone know to stay away from this product as i know there are many others out there just like it i even bought the dvr station which is cool and would be perfect if the actual archos would work but i cannot say i m pleased in any way with my purchase i just hope i get some refund for this 
this is junk i bought one of these about days ago and it s already broken i try to charge my ipaq with the suggested tip and the adapter begins to continually reset my pda not only that but it drains rather than charges the battery this is an extremely overpriced piece of junk you d be better off taking the large amount of money you would invest buying this product and consolidating whatever various devices you re trying to charge into one smart phone pdawhatever that does everything you want 
terrible product when we first bought this television we thought it was great months later it stopped working we thought it was the lamp wrong two authorized samsung service centers can t seem to fix it it has been in the repair shop for months and hasn t been working for over months we ve spent so far and now we re looking to buy another set definitely not sansung 
false reviews does anybody else think it s an amazing coincidence that everyone who gave this product a positive review has only reviewed it and other iclean products something s a litttttle fishy about that ive tried it and it really doesn t work that well with scratches if i wanted a shiny polished ipod i d buy cheap windex 
a warning do not use i had no problems burning to these discs its when i went back a few months later to these discs and found out that none of them work anymore after further research i found out that memorex uses the cheapest dye available and thus the dvds have absolutelly no life to them my discs started dying after a few months in addition in you physically hold the disc in your hands you can feel how warped physically it has become this is true for all the discs about of them i can not not recommend this product stronly enough 
the worst waterproof heaphones on the market i have spent from on waterproof headphones over the last years and i can say without hesitation these are the absolute worst of the bunch before i discuss this brand i would like to say if you are a swimmer and buy waterproof headphones they are going to short out so be ready to buy new ones every few months that having been said let s talk about the ho brand the first thing that i could not understand about these headphone is why a bungy cord behind the neck would be so short there is no way for any normal person to use these comfortably once they are in your ears you are not able to comfortably rotate your head without pulling at least one of the ear pieces out of your ear to solve the problem i just removed the head piece so that i would just have the ear pieces and could stick them in my ears and swim away well that was not possible because the ear pieces continuously slipped out of my ears i even changed the ear piece covers to some that i had used in the past the ear pieces still slipped out of my ears i spent more time fiddling with this garbage than i did swimming let me just sum this up by saying this is the only pair of waterproof headphones that i have thrown away that still worked these are the worst headphones ever opt for the brand they work just fine after you cut the tips off and replace them with your own ! 
magellan could have done better the cord works just fine but by the time you get the usb cord and the v cord together there is a lot of cord it would make more sense to have a cigarette adapter that pluged into the back of the unit the same way the usb cord does that way there isn t a bunch of cord attached to the unit 
doesn t work don t buy this there are deaf toddlers who can record my voice better than this microphone 
good product forget about service good product forget about service i e mailed infocus about my faulty projector th january it is now th january and i still do not have my projector that s right it s been one year sincemy projector stopped working i have given up on it being repaired it was under warranty and am nowstruggling to get it back so that i can repair it out of my own pocket check this company s record atthe better business bureau it is deemed to be unsatisfactory due to unanswered complaints 
don t buy i wasted a day trying to get this to work on two different pcs the first a dell m precision laptop with gb memory and a ghz processor would capture sound just fine but only color haze for video i thought that it was because the m has underpowered usb ports so i wasted the second half of my day on my newer faster desktop also gb memory the best that i got was audio with the sound speeded up voices sounded like they were on helium and the same color haze for video apparently it doesn t pay to scrimp in this area i will promptly return the product and look for something better from the other reviews it doesn t appear that wasting more time putzing with tech support would prudent 
garbage i suffered with this clock for a year because it was a gift and expensive even on the lowest setting the blue glow is so bright my finace says it looks like an alien spaceship is landing in the room the sound is so so and it has no battery backup lose power for a second and you have to reset everthing it is also very big taking up my nightstand the final straw was that it has trouble tuning in even the strongest radio stations where i live this morning i finally gave in accepted reality and tossed it in the trash i won t miss it at all 
philips ph cd tocassette converter i ordered this item because it was the lowest priced of three remarkably similar devices all had the same description and specs it worked for about weeks and then quit a friend with the same device suggested checking the wire connection inside the cassette which had come loose since then it has come loose twice more so i just don t use it anymore when it worked it worked fine but it is at best an inexpensive and temporary solution 
at this point don t bother i have the luxury of writing this review a little bit further out in the technology cycle than most of the others so i can say just get yourself a better wireless router based on the reviews here several online fora and my own personal experience i can confirm to you that you have about a chance of actually getting this to work and you might get that percentage up a little bit if you keep returning defective ones and trying another but why bother at this point there are higher power routers high gain directional antennae and there are even products sporting n which inherently has a better range that a b or gif you ve gotten into a situation where your router is inadequate for your needs research and get yourself a top notch router with good broadcast power i would strongly recommend against trying to remedy an inadequate router by trying to add this product to your network i understand that my suggestion may be more expensive but i am seriously saying that you will avoid wasting any more than necesary of the precious remainder of your time on this earth definitely hours if by some miracle everything works on the th or th try and probably a couple of days assuming that after or tries you send back the first one and try again with a new one 
doesn t appear to work with exploruist xl this is a qualified bad rating of this bracket because it doesn t appear to work with the xl model of the explorist gps just took delivery of the vehicle mounting bracket pn which is widely advertised to be suitable for the magellan explorist gps series well i can tell you that either something was left out of the package or more likely this bracket is not suitable for use with the larger explorist xl gps i hope someone can provide directions as to how this puppy will hold the xl gps but until they do ive asked magellan for clarification as to the suitability of this bracket with the explorist xl model be very carefull if you plan to use this bracket with the larger explorist xl gps next day update response from magellan to my question about suitability of p n magellan vehicle mounting bracket for explorist tm gps for use with explorist xl was to recommend that i request you to get the swivel mounting bracket for this unit i read that to mean the explorist xl will not work with this product magellan case pertains 
wrong item pictured the item in the picture is not the corresponding product for the description the picture is for the cf to xd adapter 
do not buy this phone phones won t stay connected to base station read the review from the guy who s wife died while he could not dial my wife has been yelling at me to get this two handsets fixed for months don t buy it ! 
great product ! for two days when this adapter first arrived i thought it was great the sound quality was excellent and free of all the distortion and interference i get from using an fm transmitter style adapter there are few open frequencies in the sf bay area the first day i used it for about minutes total didnt have far to drive and it worked great the second day i had a bit farther to drive after about minutes it quit hasn t worked again since i didn t expect it to last forever but less than an hour yes it has a year warranty just send the unit back with a money order to cover the return postage of course then you re spending more in postage than you originally spent for the unit 
expect more from sony when you buy a name like sony you expect to get decent stuff this dvd recorder failed miserably no s video inputs in the rear so you have to run s video to the front panel which my year old loved to unplug nice editing features if you have the time unit malfunctioned within a year and is currently in getting warranty work done who knows if i will get it back i replaced it with a lite on dvd recorder at less than half the price and am very happy with it 
batteries not included the description advertises no power cord required and the box has large print stating no ac power needed smaller print however notes that if you want the caller id which isn t back lit to function that you need to provide aa batteries the last thing i wanted was one more thing that required batteries 
over priced ltunder powered will not hold bose souround spkrs will not mount for key hole speakers also i paid for these on amazon the saw them in wal mart for good for a cheap system but if your speakers weigh more than lbs step u 
mouse vista don t buy this product if you are running microsoft vista microsoft has certified this mouse but it does not bear the works with vista tag now you tell me microsoft certifies it but it does not work with steer clear of this item for now no support that will enable its operation also globazar vendor sells non retail packaging with their own typed up and misspelled directions product looks either reman or used to me hope this helps 
not a good product don t buy if you plan on printing often runs out very very fast 
bad idea stay away from these devices ! i bought of them and of them are already having problems unit alone has logged over errors and i can t get imation to do anything about it they come with a year warranty you must email them for support i have emailed times with no response if you call the imation hq in missouri they will not accept support calls for this product you must go though the email website so in my option i wasted over on this product it ain t worth 
don t waste your money there s a reason this thing is only bucks it s absolute junk i put it into the cassette player in my car and the sounds were completely distorted the voice constantly skips and the casette sometimes clicks the quality of sound in my car is usually amazing and basically there was no bass sound coming through my speakers using this device i ve tried both sides but still no avail i plan on returning it if shipping doesn t cost more than the product itself 
please don t buy a zune i bought the zune around christmas time of i used it on a daily basis and was happy with it early in april it stopped working after spending three hours on the phone with four technicians microsoft accepted my return for repair and sent me a box to ship it to their repair facility two weeks later i received the zune back with a note that the zune was not repaired because the problem it had was not within the warranty limitations they did not tell me what the problem was only that they did not fix it i was more then dismayed i had spent almost with tax and shipping to buy this product i did not abuse it in any way please think twice before buying this product if and when it breaks microsoft will not fix it and you will be stuck with a paperweight 
this system blows not in a good way do not buy this system for the money there are much better systems out there i bought this for my family room mainy for the small size of the cube speakers the main problem with the system which bose has corrected by the way is that the acoustimass component boses fancy name for a subwoofer is not active or powered which means the base is totally inadequate and is overun by the cubes which have no mid or bass ranges the result is that you get a very tinny sound out of most applications including dvd s i ended up getting a sony active subwoofer and it sounds much better in hindsight i would have bought a different brand than bose but already had to much invested in bose to scrap the system completely and the size of the cubes is nice still pissed that i spent that much money on a substandard system but hey got sucked into the bose marketing machine 
problems with units the reviews for this product are excellent and i was so excited to upgrade to hdmi switching the first unit received had a loud hum in the audio and hdmi from my new sony player through this unit created an extreme blue cast on the video i returned the unit and another was sent to me this unit had no hum in the audio but the blue cast was still there when using hdmi from the sony dvd player it was not the dvd player because when i hooked the hdmi from the dvd player directly to my tv everything was perfect i am very disappointed in this unit as for amazon they have been great in responding to my problems getting a replacement unit to me and then refunding my purchase i give amazon stars 
misleading description my first and main complaint about this product is that it does not fit the gb ipod video the gb model is thicker than the gb and this case won t close around the gb ipod a secondary complaint is that though the case is sturdy and the foam lining will adequately protect a gb ipod from shocks there is no protection for the screen it s just a hole in the case like the hole for using the wheel and i just require more protection for my video ipod a third minor complaint is that there s a non removable knob on the back of the case for attaching the belt clip and the knob makes it uncomfortable in a shirt or pants pocket i m returning mine for all of these reasons and going with a clear hard plastic case that protects the screen too 
great while it worked broke after months really liked it would have rated it starbut last night it suddenly stopped working and would not turnon anymore only the clock works just one month out of warranty from other reviews this seems to be a common problem 
dead on day this is the first mp player i ever bought after much researching i decided on the iaudio u mb as it fit my needs and the reviews rated it as excellent on day i figured out how to load cd which was relatively simple on day i used the player it worked and sounded great simple to use i decided to load in some more music i got cd on then it stopped working dead won t turn on just dead does not seem to be the battery unless the battery life is the minutes that i used it and it won t recharge 
sandisk cruzer mini gb usb flash drive review it would not download it just stopped about the way through i will have to send it back 
never worked properly died after about uses this unit never really worked properly from the start i would get the fearsome little balloon in the bottom right of xp that said delayed write failed fairly often then one day i plugged it in and xp would not recognize it at all tried in in three different computers linux and xp and still didn t work popped out the drive inside hooked it up to the computer directly via the ata cable and the drive works find so the enclosure was the culprit bad 
complete waste of money if you buy it you ll be spending forty bucks on a stand with no features that the zune doesn t already provide sync cable output headphone jack that s it this might be worth buying if it came with speakers youd think zune would want to provide accessories that compete with ipod instead of making the ipod look so much better i suppose if you want waste more money to buy the remote sold separately it might be worth paying twenty bucks for the dock but definitely not forty or whatever discount amazon might give 
not a lot of choices i purchased this about months ago i had problems with the installation and was on with tech support for the better part of an hour because my printer is a bit older and not plug and play ready a lot of the functions had to be disabled the product worked for about months but is now not fuctioning i am being asked to return it for a replacement but i am finding they do not support this model any longer with the price of printers faxes these days i might as well replace my fax and buy one with a usb and a new wireless server to boot 
the worst palm i have ever had i have owned a palm since they were first produced by us robotics this is by far the worst for reliability i never had any problems with prior models palm palm iii palm iiixe this is the second t i have had i returned the first one because it constantly locked up just like an old windows pc and when it was working the hot sync would fail a lot of the time i am ready to send the replacement they sent me back because the battery lasts about days even when i am not using it then i have a hard time getting it to turn on i usually have to leave it plugged in for an extended period of time until it finally decides to turn itself on what a waste of money i wish i still had my palm iiixe 
poor compatibility while the verbatim has burned well in of my recordings they fail to operate in at least different dvd players 
great sound awful design design flaw fixed very simply put the sound is wonderful the design stinks i too crazy glued the rubber earcups to the plastic earphones that lasted days and they fell off i don t know what bose is thinking clearly they are not doing any end user testing update bose has issued replacement earcups which apparently don t fall off pretty cool i gotta upgrade my rating from to 
not very ergonomic at all if the thing actually fit my ear i m sure i would have loved it this headset wants a bigger ear than i have that s for sure if i hook it around my ear in the way that feels most comfortable the little soundpiece hits below my ear canal meaning that i cannot hear anything if i jam the soundpiece into my ear which is seriously uncomfortable and takes some work because it s too large to fit in there easily ! the ear hook doesn t even touch the top of my ear just poor design overall on the positive side seemed to be sufficient for skype which is what i had bought it for wouldn t recommend it for listening to music of course turns anything bass into tinny sound in any case i need to find the packaging so i can send this back 
disappointing bought the drx u to replace an internal lg burner that gave out after about months of fairly regular use have previously had an iomagic internal that gave out after about months and a sony series external that still works fine after over years albeit at x max w no dl capability i chose the new sony because of the longevity of older one vs my other models plus i only paid for it at a major electronics store on sale installation went fine plugged in the cables turned it on and win xp automatically loaded software for it after a required restart i burned by st dvd sony x r single layer disk using nero express and was disappointed at the minute burn time took over minutes for the unit to spin up and down over and over before actually starting to write also noticed that the unit was considerably louder than my previous burners went to sony support site downloaded latest firmware update ss and installed it unit came with ss install went fine just be warned that it automatically initiates a windows shutdown upon completion no option to delay it burned the same data to new disk and was surprised to find that even though write process started much more quickly total burn time increased to over minutes i immediately tried burning same data one more time the burn failed after about minutes with just a write error showing up in the log when i ejected the disk it was very warm to the touch and i caught a faint whiff of burning silicon i waited a while before trying again burned the same data one more time and everything went fine with a burn time of just over minutes immediately went to burn another disk of new data and had another failure after about minutes disk was again very warm tried again immediately afterwards same result upgraded nero to latest versions just to be safe first burn went ok a little over minutes next burn immediately afterwards failed faint smell of burning silicon again since then i ve burned several disks successfully but burn times have ranged from to over minutes i now always wait at least minutes bt burns to let the unit cool off overall the excessive heat and noise along with the varied burn times leaves me disappointed with this unit maybe i just got a lemon 
remote system all i have to say is it sucks ! i have bought two of the v remotes and they have both crapped out on me not to mention i tried calling viper alarm systems and their customer service sucks because they won t even return your calls they don t insure their remotes either the new remotes are around and it s a waiste of money don t buy their car alarm systems it will just keep breaking on you 
would be great if it worked in theory it would be a great product except that my first ipod of this model had its hard drive go bad only a few months after i got it apple replaced it great process but now the replacement has gone bad after less than a year and of course now the warranty has passed poorly built dodgy model don t waste your money 
sandisk cruzer mini gb usb flash drive review it would not download it just stopped about the way through i will have to send it back 
failed in a few months installed it to my nissan xterra first it was working fine but after a few months the channel switching knob stopped working twists free but the channel number remains making the whole thing kompletely useless 
it s a sony i should have hear other rater s advice but then i ve said to myself hey it s a sony they wouldn t release such a bad product or at least they would stop selling it after years the first review dates feb i already have coasters and counting now before i buy any sony product i say to myself don t buy it its a sony 
old adage is true you get what you pay for i was hoping for a great deal on these batteries but like other reviewers i ve found that they run out of juice incredibly fast i m amazed that other reviewers have had such good luck because things like my wireless keyboard which uses two aa s ran out of juice in a couple days of normal use while my automatic sprinkler time that uses two aa s lasted only a week be warned that these aren t quite the bargain they may initially seem 
good audio lousy handset interface once again a consumer electronics hardware maker proves that they can t develop a good software interface for their device in terms of physical design this is one of the best cordless phones out there the sound quality is also quite good and the dect technology works on a band that keeps it free of wifi interference however i had to return this phone right away because the interface is so awful first of all philips really shortchanged this device by putting in a cheap lcd display that can only display letters on caller id and then they are letters formed in barely legible block style on the numerical display i mean how much more would if have cost them to put in a modern lcd display with enough pixels to show real letters but the clincher is the poor design of this phone s caller id interface call it caller confusion if you have caller id with name service from your phone company with this phone you can only see the name and only the first letters of it ! while the phone call is coming in there is no way to scroll the display to show the phone number you can only see that after the phone has stopped ringing what use is that if the incoming phone call actually has a name from the phone company this is barely ok but for the many calls that have no name this phone will show cell pho or unknown or serv there is no way to get it to show the actual number while the phone is still ringing if you re trying to screen calls it s essentially useless whoever designed this interface just doesn t get what caller id is for in the first place i would have loved to like this phone because i think the phones from panasonic vtech motorola and others are horribly ugly and my previous panasonic had the worst audio quality imagnable but this phone doesn t cut it as well why is the cordless phone market so devoid of good products 
no support let s be honest this product ain t cheap it s not something you can just throw away if it decides to stop working i bought mine at cpenusa com delivery was great only took them a couple of days however my c pen cable was damaged the connector to the c pen was for some reason cut in half without it you can t recharge or connect the c pen to the pc i called their main office all the way in sweden during the office hours no response i sent three e mails to cpenusa no response i don t care if the product itself is great ill never know now will i if you re unable to receive support when you need em you re screwed if you re just interested in electronic equipments just want to try things out and don t really care if you re on your own go ahead and try it let me know how this thing really is otherwise buy a product that you can trust on with respect to after sales support 
don t waste your money in general i ve been happy with belkin accessories but this cable is the pits it lasted less than a month ! i used it to connect my hd dvr cable box to my receiver no crimps kinks or undue stress on it but within days my audio went from spotty to noticeable gaps to nonexistent i don t like to support the monster cable hype but because of their lifetime warranty i bought their cable to replace this one so far no problems 
overpriced this model was much more expensive than other brands because it was made from sony i believed the product will meet my expectations since it was more expensive than samsung or lg anyways after using it for a monthi already have two dead pixels both red and very frequently i get these white pixels which i need to press with a cotton swab so it turns back to normal save your money and go for another product ! 
be an educated consumer ! you don t have to spend a lot for digital cables you don t have to spend a fortune on expensive cables when you are dealing with digital signals keep in mind that all digital interfaces have error correction built into them did you know the internal components of consumer electronics are connected with tin and nickel there s no gold inside ! so there s no need for oxygen free gold tipped multi sheilded super mega supreme cables if you don t believe me buy this cable and a no name cheapie compare them for yourself you will see no difference with analog signals a good quality cable may make a difference although the difference is usually only visible on an oscilloscope 
poor quality control bad product i received my first unit and noticed the low volume noise problem i returned it to the repair site at my expense and received a replacement red sauce on the speakers and the cd would not even power up obviously no one had even looked at it i received a second replacement unit cd would not even spin and i received error message called again and they are shipping my third unit this is very frustrating as the repair service has very poor quality control and the unit has significant problems as i am not the only one with these problems 
please don t buy a zune i bought the zune around christmas time of i used it on a daily basis and was happy with it early in april it stopped working after spending three hours on the phone with four technicians microsoft accepted my return for repair and sent me a box to ship it to their repair facility two weeks later i received the zune back with a note that the zune was not repaired because the problem it had was not within the warranty limitations they did not tell me what the problem was only that they did not fix it i was more then dismayed i had spent almost with tax and shipping to buy this product i did not abuse it in any way please think twice before buying this product if and when it breaks microsoft will not fix it and you will be stuck with a paperweight 
doesn t pass the test of time great looking keyboard unfortunately all it takes is one minor spill and the keyboard is destroyed that includes cleaning and don t think you are ever going to take it apart and dry it the keyboard self destructs after you have the count them s and s of screws i called their customer support they weren t like dell nobody is that bad but their resolution was to buy a new one from them for off their retail price shipping was extra so you save maybe off street prices allinall they are no longer the good company they were in the past they need competition so i m pulling out my old logitech from retirement too bad they don t make those old keyboards anylonger 
too bulky not for a sony vaio i bought this case for a sony vaio sz after seeing a spotlight review saying that the vaio would fit perfectly inside i ended up returning the bag for a refund for two reasons my vaio screen was just slightly too big to fit in the case the case itself is very well padded with thick foam i probably could have forced it in but it would definitely have taken some forcing i d guess a macbook would fit better the case itself is just too bulky i bought it looking for a sleeve that would protect my notebook while carrying it in a backpack or messenger bag this case is very large for a sleeve and would barely fit in my bags true it comes with a shoulder strap but if you re going to use that you might as well go with a regular sized bag so you can carry your power cords and other accessories this case seems to have trouble making up its mind whether it s a sleeve or a regular notebook bag doing a poor job at either it s too big for a sleeve and too small for a bag 
creates new scratches didn t fix the old ones i bought this repair kit so i could watch a rental movie it had quite a few scratches and was skipping during the early parts after i was done i had even more scratches and the movie skipped in the exact spot it did before 
nice features but no range this phone has about a foot range before it starts cutting out it has great features but you can t really move all about your home 
the good and the terrible i have waited until i finally received a working model to post my experience with logitech first let me begin by saying that now that i have a working audio station i really do love it the product deserves the excellent ilounge review it received the sound is great it has an audio in port and an s video out port on the back i cannot for the life of me understand why there are units made by apple and bose that are nothing more than some speakers additionally the am fm tuner works well i really only use the fm tuner but have found it to be good better than i expected but not perfect however once again most units at this price point do not have any sort of am fm tuner and that was a sacrifice i was not willing to make for all of these reasons i really do like the audio station however if there was even another product on the market with these characteristics amfm s video out audio in i would have taken my business elsewhere in a second my experience with logitech was terrible first i brought home a unit from best buy in early february and found that it was one of a bad batch that went out to best buy stores see other reviews on this page for more details on which units have the problem with buttons not responding after the buttons on the front of the unit didn t respond i got online and read the reviews posted here on amazon as well as on logitech s own website where they finally admitted that this was a flawed product i then contacted logitech to see about having a product sent to me as part of the warranty the representative at logitech told me i would be better off taking my unit back to best buy i realized that i knew more about the problem with the audio station than the customer service rep did after only about minutes of poking around online i told him that apparantly a bad batch went out to best buy stores and the last thing i was going to do was to waste my time returning a product to best buy only to bring another faulty unit back home i also told him that i d read that audio stations coming directly from the factory were reportedly working fine and i wanted one of those after some time on the phone we arranged for my unit to be picked up and then i would receive a new unit in days days later i called this was the first time i found out that the unit was out of stock and my order was on backorder i was furious that i had to call to find out the item was on backorder not only was this the first i heard of the problem but there was nothing they could do for me i was told the first week of march they would recieve some in the warehouse i waited about days into march i called again the order hadn t made it to the warehouse a small order was due to arrive but it was not guaranteed that i would get one of them again i was very displeased but there was nothing i could do this was the first time that a customer representative seemed to know what he was talking about and actually served as an advocate for me to their credit i did recieve a unit out of that first batch it arrived relatively quickly and works fine however it was a terrible terrible experience along the way if you buy one of these i guarantee buying directly from the factory logitech does not seem inclined to recall their bad units and appears to be content with letting customers deal with their problem if you do buy from best buy or from amazon be careful you may receive one of the flawed units and who knows how long it will take a replacement to get to you it basically took logitech weeks to get me a new model i ve never had so much trouble giving a company of my money i plan to never shop with logitech again 
poor re winder this re winder does not re wind the tapes all the way and is very noisy 
decent phone power outage also took out base unit the material and ergonomics of this phone is average the selling point of this phone for me is its ability to connect up to handsets using one phone line below are the factors that i considered before purchasing and my experience range the range of the phone is very good i can be feet away from the base unit and the call signal will stay constant and not drop call quality average i have a plantronics cs wireless headset that is on the mhz frequency connected to a corded base unit the call quality on the wireless headset is crystal clear when i have switched during mid conversation from the handset to headset or vice versa callers have noted a significant difference in the clarity of the call the uniden is much more muffled and less clear it is however comparable to most cordless phone not exceptional but not bad durability average i have dropped my handsets on rare occasions they survived the drops onto the carpet quite well one of the handset did drop onto my hardwood floor which cracked the screen but the force was not significant and it didn t scratch the hardwood floor special note i suffered a power outage during a major windstorm the base unit will not boot up this appears to have happened to other reviewers this problem appears to have afflicted only this piece of electronic in my whole house on this issue i have to drop my rating from stars to stars 
constant noise july st i was looking for a dvd player for my bedroom at costco and couldn t resist the price for this brand new philips hts hts is the same except that it comes all in silver rather than silver blacki played some dvds and cds and after days i decided to return it for reasons it makes a hissing sound when it s turned off now it wouldn t bother me too much in a basement althought it would still be anoying but it s a definite no no in the bedroom rear speakers are almost silent no matter how much you increase the volume to them if you don t mind these things then by all means go for it aug update having nothing better to do i went and purchased another unit from costco to see if indeed i have a bad unit or it s a design manufacturing issue surprise surprise second unit makes the same exact noise only a bit louder curious enough im a mechanical engineer with some knowledge of electronics i open the unit to see where is this noise coming from it is the ac dc transformer more specific two uf capacitors making this noise that is really poor design and or low quality components i did not expect this from a brand name like philips this is no different than any no name units out there at half price as a result i am changing my initial reivew and recommend that you look for a different product this one is definately not worth the money i cannot update the stars but this time i would rate it with stars oct update it stopped reading cds but it reads dvds no problem returned to costco ! 
what cheap can buy i won t beat around the bush this is a terrible product i was looking for something to allow mic level recordings on my computer macbook pro and i wasn t sure i wanted to spend the money on an imic i found this remarkably cheaper device and decided to try it instead when i got it the first thing i thought upon seeing the packaging was how un professional it looked the box looks like something someone printed off their computer and it even had spelling errors on it when i popped the device out of the box it came apart in my hand right then i knew i had made a mistake it comes with a minidisc that doesn t fit in a mac and only had pc software on it of course the box and the product page don t say what platform this device is for and indeed my mac did recognize it when plugged in however when i switched over to usb audio out my ears were nearly blown out there was absolutely no way to control the volume upon plugging in a mic i found the device didn t even respond the audio in channel lights up half way as though it s picking up some signal but it doesn t make a sound tested with line in and garage band and no response this is a shoddy unprofessional product that should be avoided at all cost don t be cheap i m sure the imic is loads better 
defective product i am returning it the bluetooth signal keeps fading in and out every seconds or so when it worked it was great but not a single song went by without the dead air problem for seconds then it would reconnect and start playing again i contacted logitech customer support and they sent me an email days later with suggetions about a completely different product then i called long distance to them and stayed on hold for minutes only to be told that it sounded like it was defective and i should return it not very satisfying customer service experience i had high hopes for this product i may order another one later and see if my luck is any better then 
not responding if you are one of those types who can become frustrated after fiddling with a portable mp player for an hour just to get songs transferred to it you d better pass this baby by i often wonder if the people that make these things ever do any real testing with real people to see how functional their devices really are the mp player itself played music fine the real problem comes when you try to add or remove music from the time i plugged it into my xppro machine to the time i unplugged it with songs on it minutes had elapsed everytime you plug it into your machine you have to reinstall the driver so you d better have a special folder setup to hold that driver youll be needing it the music manager is prone to lockups get ready to see a lot of not responding shutdowns and launching task manager to try and shut down the frozen music manager you will find this will not shut it down though you will have to unplug the usb cable from your computer to get it to shut down but do not try and deactivate the usb device like you are supposed to before unplugging any usb device the os will not let you you will get a program is accessing this device message that program is your not responding music manager when you add a song it puts the song where it wants to you d think a song that begins with a would come after the song that begins with b on the device but that s not the way it works and there is no way to order the songs after you add them and they go in the wrong order you try and drag it up or down and it locks up and don t try renaming to get them to order that way because they will not rename properly the music manager is a poor design as far as the device itself you d think that in our high tech age they could come up with a fool proof connector think again you ll need a magnifying glass to connect the usb cable to the device because it can go in the wrong way and this is not the type of device you want for jogging or working out they supply this long necklace for it to dangle from but you start running down the street with this device hanging off your neck whipping back and forth and you ll be knocking out fellow joggers left and right ! you d think they could also design a pair of ear phones that actually fit in your ear ! just slow walking with this device shoved in my pocket i was frequently putting the ear bobs back in my ear and don t even ask me what it was like to replace the battery on this power hungry gadget i guess my certifications in it just don t qualify me to be skillful enough to use such a high tech device perhaps you will be more fortunate but if you want my advice pass iriver products by the hardware may work but you need software to run it and unless you like the message not responding try another product 
a fool his money soon parted very disapointed bad design not for the gym which is what i bought them for sound is ok not wonderful wish i would have read these reviews before i spent the 
troublesome i bought of the rino s for my wife and i to use for hiking boating and geocaching we were excited about the prospect of peer to peer positioning etc after minutes one of them locked up then the second one would not transmit only receive a radio communication the only way to get either one of them to function properly again was to remove the power source wait a few seconds and reinstall and power up again the first time this happened i was hoping it would be an isolated incident then it happened again minutes later i checked the software one was running ver and the other webupdater would not work with one of them it would lock up during the firmware upgrade i chose to immediately return the items thinking that if it is this much trouble now what will it be like later i expected better quality than this from garmin great features and an intuitive user interface are a plus however dependability in the long run is apparently non existent the gps portion of the unit is terrific the problem seems to be aligned with the communication creating instability i am purchasing a different unit and plan to make it a garmin product again amazon is easy to deal with on returns stars to amazon 
poor audio output and no mic mute make big al mad i want a wireless headset for skype and maybe some gaming i thought the zx was it but it s not not even close first the sound can get really bottom out sometimes my skype friends sound like gurgly lagoon monsters hungry and ready to feed i can t hear the mid or high ranges of their voices and the connection seems unstable causing pops and drop outs so i take it back lagoon monsters may be more coherent initially i thought this was a skype problem but i plugged in my wired headset and i could hear them clearly i like the headset design but it doesn t feel comfortable on my ear i imagine if my grandma took out her dentures and sucked on my ear i could get the same sensation it s ok for a few minutes but after that i can t take it anymore wearing the headset that is volume levels are fine and the volume buttons work as does the power button the call button on the other hand is an anomoly it does nothing unless you use voice on windows live messenger and even then you have to install software the button doesn t work for skype or yahoo but what annoys me the most is that button would serve much better as a microphone mute button this headset does not have a mic mute ! volume and mic mute controls are essetial on any headset ! how could you not have mic mute so those are my big gripes a few other things that annoy me the usb receiver is large considering the dongles that come with mice and other peripherals are pretty small nowadays it also has a cord which is good if you want to set the receiver on your desk but i prefer just a small usb dongle that plugs directly into my pc i bought a wireless headset to forego wires not take one off the headset and add it to the receiver it would be nice if the headset was bluetooth so i could use it with my cellphone as it stands it just works with pcs i know i m probably asking too much seeing how microsoft overlooked some of the more basic elements like a mic mute i want to use a wireless headset but there s not much to like about this one i regret purchasing this headset i just hope my rebate comes through to soften the blow 
please wait flashflashflash great features unreliable poor design ok lets not mince words it sucks hey i m a big fan of panasonic but this unit appears to suffer from many problems right out of the box the dvd player hangs and only a complete restart will solve the problem also the remote has a bad habit of completely freezing which requires you to cycle power to the unit not good but my biggest complaint is the alleged one touch recording this feature does not work at all and the alternate method requires a phd in rocket science so this unit is going back to the store not to mention how slow this thing is i ve never seen any home electronics device that prompted you to wait well i cant wait to get my money back to panasonic s credit this player recorder has all the right features and outputs like hdmi and optical audio and the upconversion to a digital display is quite good even from old vhs tapes that appear to be near dvd quality however this machine is very buggy and the manual as i have read is absolutely worthless if you can follow it then you don t have to take the mensa entrance exam you re already in 
do not buy for a mac with the microsoft website clearly mentioning macos x functionality i purchased this mouse for my imac fully intending to use the built in bluetooth for keyboard and mouse no wires free up a usb port this mouse will not pair with the built in mac bluetooth macos x even when you use it with the supplied microsoft dongle if i wanted a dongle i would have bought an rf wireless mouse ! the supplied microsoft drivers don t see the mouse and you cannot set the functionality for the additional buttons or left right scroll capabilities 
never received never receieved this item contacted company told me it was the shipping fault 
horrible dvd player it constantly paused and froze up playing brand new dvds i bought at best buy gave me headache just watching it that i started renting vhs tapes to watch samsung should do their testing before releasing junk like this on the market make the working consumers the testing guinea pigs 
don t buy this product i bought this product as a way to keep a large amount of backup data saved however i have fought with the drivers for days now whenever the drive is working the usb on my computer does not work if i try to use multiple computers on the same drives it crashes even with the newest updates i will be returning this product asap i m very disappointed and will not be buy netgear again i only wish there was a star revie 
if i d wanted shorter wire both spools of this wire came in two pieces i discovered that i d have to splice it halfway through a difficult install urhhhh avoid these problems by buying other vendor s products 
sad to say sony dvd recorders aren t the best i started using this product on on the dvd i was recording wouldn t finalize after many hours of watching the dvd flash finalizing i tried to turn the dvd off it wouldn t turn off i ultimately had to pull the plug and of course the dvd was useless this has happened seven times over the last weeks now before using the recorder i clean it with a laser lens cleaner and still yesterday i put a disk in just to play it and it kept spinning out of control it sounded as if the machine was eating up my disk i again couldn t turn the unit off or eject the dvd after about ten minutes and pressing many buttons it stopped i was able to eject the disk and it wasn t damaged but it really confused me as to why this happened i have had many other brands of dvd recorders that turned out to be poor quality also even if i paid over for them i now keep a journal of problems with my recording equipment as it is costing me quite a bit to record anything only good point about the sony dvd recorder is it does record a very good picture but with the above problems i am not sure how long this unit is suppose to function or last would have thought purchasing a sony dvd recorder it would have lasted a lot longer than a month 
bad news bad news all the way around card does not work could not get response from seller 
parts missing customer service not available i got this to have at our home for our grandson but it came with no remote although the box stated one was included plus it didn t seem to work in our home with our cable service and after calling customer service several times and only getting voice mail i felt it might be a sign that this product was a lemon and i d better cut my loses and return it ! it may just have been the one that i received but it didn t seem like an american made high quality item again it may only have been one lemon and the rest may all be super but i m only commenting on my experience so you can weigh your decision to buy or not on that 
pounds max i bought this mount because i wanted to be able to adjust both the vertical and horizontal alignment of my new hdtv panel the product description says this item can handle up to pounds my panel is about pounds and the vertical adjustment simply cannot handle the weight of the panel i used the heavy load bolt that s supposed to take care of this but it doesn t even come close the tv doesn t just slip down a bit it just sags against the wall i can t imagine this mount could hold up a panel over pounds without assistance fwiw the mount does feel sturdy and it can hold the panel securely i m using a block of wood to offset the bottom of the panel from the wall i ll replace that with a v shaped brace that acts as a cable guide and will let the horizontal swivel function of the wall mount to work properly also the screws included with the mount were too small they didn t fit my tv and the screw heads were so small they slipped through the larger mm mounting holes the lag bolts provided had little hex heads meant to be tightened with the included allen wrench terrible who wants to screw nearly inches of bolt into a stud with an allen wrench i replaced them with x lag bolts and used a socket wrench i understand they re trying to make a simple installation but there s no way to get around the fact that the holes for the mount need to be drilled into the stud anyone who has a drill will have a proper set of wrenches for driving proper bolts i only gave this two stars because after a trip to the store for proper screws and with the addition of a bracket to provide the proper offset this mount seems like it will hold my tv off the floor and allow me to swivel it from side to side however i wouldn t recomment this product for any panel over pounds tops 
old adage is true you get what you pay for i was hoping for a great deal on these batteries but like other reviewers i ve found that they run out of juice incredibly fast i m amazed that other reviewers have had such good luck because things like my wireless keyboard which uses two aa s ran out of juice in a couple days of normal use while my automatic sprinkler time that uses two aa s lasted only a week be warned that these aren t quite the bargain they may initially seem 
not great loads of static i agree with the previous reviewer there is a lot of static and interference with these things we actually hardly ever use them for that reason our house is small enough that we can hear the music from the other room through walls and doorways and at least it doesn t sound like an am radio on a stormy day also they do have huge wall warts the big converters on the cords finding an inconspicuous place to plug them in is impossible since all the inconspicuous places are behind furniture which can t be put close to the wall anymore for the size of the things on the plugs i guess you get what you pay for i would have paid more if i had known how bad these would be 
cheap poor sound quality few features not too easy to program don t waste your money 
caution only star for powerpoint presentations unfortunately this projector comes up very short for powerpoint presentations because of the x resolution as a result the images are blurry and fuzzy when i called epson to explore this issue the rep said this was indeed a problem and results in the screen door effect if you intend to use this projector for powerpoint presentations you need to get a projector with much better at least x or better resolution wish i had known that 
run run forrest run fast take it from me is not functional if you are reading this then you are gump y and you and i must be family first i love amazon they are the consistent type of e merchant and that s good ! but but but but why would a designated by me upper echelon merchant like amazon carry this sandisk gb compact flash card type i sdcfb it simply is not functional information that i stored sandisk gb compact flash card type i sdcfb is gone or not readable i am surprised that amazon did not catch onup with the problem the product won t retain any info then i had to store less and less information on the card so that my info is able to stay on the card another hours i decided to contact amazon they were very shortly and cordially sent me a replacement sandisk gb compact flash card type i sdcfb with the paperwork for returning the original sandisk gb compact flash card type i sdcfbthen i got something that a did have the shape of a gig sandisk cf card b did have the sandisk label that says sandisk gb compact flash card type i sdcfbc and did have the original shiny factory sandisk package none being the less different computers later and hour had passed couldn t recognize what is inserted into the cf reader d the brand new replacement card i got with the original factory wrapping that s brand new and untouched and unrecognized by computers one may safely assume pardon the facetiousness sandisk gb compact flash card type i sdcfb is yet to be recognized from amazon twice in the mail i got a sandisk gb compact which flash card type i sdcfb both cards i received had a problem and therefore it is safe to assume that sandisk gb compact flash card type i sdcfb production have a major glitch i mean the memory card cannot be used for memory purposes i have to yet see what or for what other than memory can i utilize a memory card i beg your pardon but in essence i am trying to imply that the sandisk products were a joke ! being the consistent e merchant that amazon always been amazon agreed to return them this was not a surprise coming from amazon in essence i strongly urge any person that makes a living and tries to have some fun with their hard earned living to not be fooled if you see sandisk run away as fast as possible you ll lose it all in a matter of a day or so sandisk gb compact flash card type i sdcfb is not compatible with data storage ! or even short transfers of data from a home computer to work spend the extra on an alternative brand that s the only way you ll get a cf card that is correctly labeled and serve intended functions i strongly recommend as well as urge individual who is thinking of getting that other brand of giga cards to make sure do so use amazon only and don t be fooled by any other e merchant who s not as high of an echelon as amazon amazon had it not been for amazon i would have lost all i paid god bless amazon for their extreme timely tentativeness i also pray for sandisk so that god renders it with the power to accomplish the purpose they stick onto their product line god bless and keep on shopping 
now you see it now you don t the jumpdrive worked fine for me for about a month and then it started acting weird it was recognized by the device manager as working properly but it did not show in my computer and was therefore inaccessible so was the jumpdrive there or not lexar live chat support attempted to help me but later resorted to sending me a resurrection tool via email with instructions after executing the tool and consequently losing my data it happened all over again five minutes later this is a little disappointing since this is the first usb drive i ve purchased and used i thought it would help with moving and storing files but it s turning out to be more trouble than it s worth 
unless you want to clean it everyday find a different one i bought this humidifier for the same reasons as many other reviewers and was happy with it for the first few nights it put out enough humidity to keep our bedroom moist and it wasn t loud especially in comparison to other humidifiers we ve tried then on the third day i noticed brown streaks on the paint on the wall nearest the humidifier i washed them off without any real problem just thinking this would be a pain to do every few days well they were back the next day and so i decided to clean the entire humidifier as well which you re only supposed to have to do weekly there was brown bacteria growing in the water tray and the base ! it was so disgusting and very hard to get off even with bleach and water our water does not have a high mineral content and i was using filtered water anyway i bet if you clean this unit every single day that wouldn t happen but who wants to clean a humidifier every single day especially when there is a baby in the mix i m just glad that we tried it out a few weeks before our baby is due ! i can t wait to take it back 
poor monitor cable i purchased this cable as a replacement and it is far worse than the original i had there is noticable quotshadowquot distortion my advice is to buy a higher quality cable w ferriete beads this cable was not useable 
dont buy it this is a piece of junk it never worked fine or the software crashes or the scan results are terrible and very very slow 
ink consumption is unacceptable beware this is the most expensive printer you ll ever own my wife went through of ink in less than a month and she doesn t print that much just text no pictures i had read the other reviews about excessive ink usage but it is much worse than i imagined i m going to throw away a perfectly good printer because i refuse to pay that much for ink this printer is also noisy with a lot of vibration the hp printers i ve owned are practically silent compared to the epson i will never buy another epson printer 
impossible okay for one i don t know how this is getting good reviews maybe i got a lemon there are two things that i hate about this product it is matte the surface to write on is not smooth this makes writing akward and unpleasant it is nearly impossible to apply and since only comes in the package if you mess up you mess up dont get this ! its also overpriced ! c mon at j r they sell a pack of a similar product for this is a waste of money 
didn t work for me but seller promised refund i purchased this product and couldn t get it to work on a pc laptop or pda cingular not only does it not register in any sd minisd card reader but the craftsmanship appears to be suspect as well i am currently pursuing a refund 
bad product horrible product it s not the seller s fault that it s such a horrible product it just is the main selling point for this is that it has video capabilities well as much lag as there is even with super low quality video settings and with a lack of support for higher resolutions above x it just ruins the selling point buy a dock made specifically for your notebook if you re looking for video capabilities the rest of the ports work fine no ps ports though for keyboard and mouse just usb not any better than a port replicator bria 
doesn t really work didn t seem to make the fm reception any better except for the fact that when i was trying to get the classical station from nyc to my horror i got loud and clear the local christian station not what i wanted the am reception was completely gone i went back to the antenna which came with the onkyo tuner which sort of works i didn t have much luck with the pin the dot tuning system more gain just made it more static y with more pain bottom line will be an attempted return to cc we ll see how that goes 
great while it lasts i loved this printer the print quality is truly phenomenal ! i had a few issues with paper sizes too many pieces being fed through the rear feed slot same as other reviewers but looked beyond those because the prints were so wonderful and yes i am speaking in past tense of my wonderful printer because it is dead at the ripe old age of months ! exactly one month after the yr warranty my printer is unfixable and hp won t do anything for me after speaking to people on the phone only one of which i understood fully and supervisors they just said that i m sol so yes very nice printer if it lasts 
dreadful i have had the t now for about a year i am surprised that i put up with it for so long it constantly freezes the web program is buggy today i lost all my settings in short what you read here is correct this is a flawed product and should have never been released stay away from it 
only for a gb vision this case was designed for the first generation gb zen vision w not the st gen gb zen vision w this was not called out on the web site as i opened the plastic clamshell packaging amazon antonline would not authorize the return of this product 
poor product despite not being written on the packaging or website my hp ipaq rx was compatible with this keyboard unfortunatly the software supplied was extremely bad clogging my pda making it run very slowely as well as this it also flickered when in use making the settings for the keyboard very difficult to change in terms of hardware i found the size and position of keys to be the biggest problem while targus does include all rows of a standard keyboard it shrinks the top row numbers and the bottom row space bar this makes it very difficult to use the space bar which is for some reason split into three parts and the numbers which could have been made full size as there is nothing else in the way i found myself constantly not hitting the right key or not hitting the right key hard enough for the key to register in terms of key position there is a gap between the keys on the left side and right side of the keyboard making hitting the keys in the middle very difficult some keys are also very small eg the right shift key and backspace making them difficult to use strange considering they are used a lot on keyboards one of the biggest problems i had with the keyboard was the lack of proper arrow keys targus includes an oval shaped four direction button that controls a mouse cursor that appears on the screen this mouse cursor is useful but needs to be supplemented with normal up down left and right keys which are needed when typing to go back to another part of the document using the mouse to do this is very frustrating the final negative thing about this keyboard was the price i paid aud for this keyboard doing some research on the internet found better models ie think outside stowaway ir keyboard available for less than half the price around aud and bluetooth keyboards available for less than aud i think it might be about time targus releases a new model pda keyboard with a design and software that are suitable for the use the keyboard will get no more tiny keys and no more than two space bars 
absolute junk backed up some movies and not even played well they either skipped or didn t play at all i backed up my harddrive with one of these and some of the files won t even open says damaged or corrupted files absolute junk ! i will stick with verbatim from now on 
painful i purchased sets of these earphones for a hour flight my husband and i both used them and we both took them out of our ears after minutes they were great at first but after minutes they really started to hurt our ears the inside of my ears were so sore i couldn t even adjust the earphones when they started coming out that s how bad my ears hurt i had the foam pad over them too and it made no difference i would not recommend these 
no antennea for the tv this portable tv sounds great except they made a few mistakes in the design they don t tell you that there is no antennea nor that the tv will not work without an antennea ! the portable dvd player is great the tv is horrible when we did get an antennea the tv worked but we went to numerous stores and the all the antenneas we found were big and bulky plus had to be hooked then unhooked when we wanted to put the unit away without an antennea sticking out to get broken don t buy this for the tv ! we ended up purchasing a different product that had the antennea built in this one was a total waste of money 
so so i bought the ihome so that i could choose which songs to wake up to off of my ipod and it worked well when it actually worked after being very late to work three times because my alarm failed to go off i tossed the item it wasn t worth all of the problems to keep at all if i couldn t even trust the alarm to get me out of bed in the morning other people have mentioned the too bright display and the gradual volume increase which i eventually got used to but i could see how they would be incredibly annoying 
don t bother using the software that comes with this kit the main reason i bought this kit was for the label applicator the software was secondary good thing that i didn t care about how good the software would be because the software for this is in a word deplorable it doesn t have support for any other label sheets other than the memorex brand which leaves you stuck with their labels its got some nice features in the software but their poorly implemented for instance it can automatically resize an image to fit a cd dvd but if you ve rotated it before that the rotation is lost it has a lot of minor quirks like that and they add up to an annoyance to use this if you get this product find a better labelling program to go with the label sheets and the applicator 
buyers beware sound blaster x fi xtreme are not based on any kind of x fi chip these cards are in fact based on audigy ls low budget version of old and outdated audigy check the markings on chips ca means it s old audigy ls even the driver file is the same p sys you can download an audigy ls driver from cl s website unpack and compare it with xtreme audio one the only difference is with sensaurad driver file software implementation of sensaura s d api i am quoting here but can confirm blue screen of death issues as i own this product 
how could microsoft screw this one up i currently use a microsoft intellimouse that i purchased about years ago it is the most comfortable mouse for medium to large sized hands bar none microsoft kept it sweet and simple and they had a winner ! why they ever took this mouse off the market i ll never understand after getting a new pc recently i decided to splurge and get one of these ultra ergonomic mice i looked at the usual suspects logitech kensington microsoft etc i was disappointed as the feel and fit of the various mice i tried weren t as smooth as the intellimouse then lo and behold i noticed that microsoft rereleased the intellimouse great my search is over i received the mouse today same design same fit awesome only one problem you manufacturing geniuses the scroll wheel rattles unbelievably how bad think of those old fashioned new year s eve noisemakers that you hold by the small handle and twirl around in a circle that s the sound it makes i m not kidding the original intellimouse scroll wheel is very quiet when in use how could you screw this one up it s the same product you offered a few years ago with the color being black now ! did you somehow lose the drawings on the original intellimouse scroll wheel did you need to save that extra cents by having it manufactured somewhere else what a dealbreaker i m sticking with my old intellimouse until microsoft gets a clue and fixes this oversight 
misrepresented product i was dissappointed to see that when i got the product there were old worn out batteries inside and i then had to go out and purchase an adapter and spend more money the keyboard works fine now but that was unacceptable for me to have had to do that i was very surprised by this from amazon since i have had such good experiences so far 
terrible reception forget using the antenna for air reception its almost useless lots of video noise and no sound on weak channels no fine tuning possible the only saving factor of this item is its cable connection works fine but if you have cable connection available why hook it up to this small screen player 
poor design unstable actually makes computer access difficult i bought this item because amazon never had the m model i wanted in stock so i settled for this one that was a big mistake the wheels on this stand are only about inches apart which makes your cpu very unstable the spring steel friction fit makes it difficult for one person to attach or remove this stand from the cpu it is really a two person operation finally if your cpu has a side access panel you will have to remove it from the stand to gain access since the stand uses a pressure fit to hold it to the computer take a look at the m cs stand i think it is a much better design 
easy to use until you have to print it out i love the idea of this product and i loved working with it i created a great layout that looked fabulous on screen but unless you have an epson printer it is very difficult to print out a great copy my hp deskjet could not handle the supplied photo paper so a friend printed on his lexmark for me it worked better but still had a few problems more paper should be included in the package in case of printing problems because after several printing problems we ran out of paper and i could not find the same photo paper in any store i ended up buying a second package just to get more of the same paper next time i will make a book using the ofoto site much more professional looking sided and just as cheap 
it does not work with macs they totally misrepresent this product it does not work with macs i feel cheated and lied to by memorex shame on you 
it didn t work for me i wish i could return it but i broke the warranty by using the hack described elsewhere i imagined listening to my computer on a dedicated fm station throughout the house the best i ever got was terrible reception in the kitchen it may work in other parts of the country or other parts of the world but it did not work for me in west palm beach 
i dont like this mouse i dont like this mouse i brought and never work its useles 
nice paper weight now where s my printer i ordered this would be a nice printer if only i could get it to print ! not to mention when i turn it on it makes a god awful sound like some thing is jammed i ve tried over and over to try to print something i ve checked my options turned it on and off and still it sits there not printing if your looking for a portible printer you have other options and i suggest using them 
earbuds shorted after only months of light usage i used these for months when they shorted out and only one side works at a time if i wiggle it it works until the wire moves i only used them about hours a week at the gym i know it s the earpod wire i went back to the ones that came with the ipod and they work fine i m not happy i wasted the money 
another case of buzzing sound i bought my monitor yesterday and found to have a buzzing sound at lower brightness lt just scheduled an exchange lcd 
poor quality and divx problems returned unit i was very excited about this unit when i ordered it but the pixelation was very bad due to the variable bit rate vbr encoding and the divx recording feature didn t actually work most of the time a blank screen or a green screen was the result unfortunately given these problems i returned the unit i think i m going to look at an older ads unit without the vbr feature to ensure quality and then do any divx transfers by software it seems that the fewer variables involved may make for a higher quality image too bad this one really had a lot of potential 
great while it worked broke after months really liked it would have rated it starbut last night it suddenly stopped working and would not turnon anymore only the clock works just one month out of warranty from other reviews this seems to be a common problem 
disappointed little girl my daughter got this for christmas from her grandma who worked long and hard to get this for her and she was so happy and excited when she opened this christmas eve she was only able to enjoy it for month when it decided to only play certain cd s it will soon be on it s way back to amazon for an exchange hopefully the new one will work and all will be well it is very very cute and my year old just loves it we are keeping our fingers crossed that there won t be any problems with the next one we will keep you posted 
not worth it for every day i just got the canon selphy cp and the best thing that i can say is that it is extremely portable if you want a picture on the fly wherever you go then i might consider this but if you are buying this to use at home like i have with an eye for toting it about the print quality is lacking sharpness and the colors are lacking depth my hp printer does a much better job but lacks the portability bottom line it doesn t produce good pictures 
i was disappointed with this tuner and wound up returning it at first i looked forward to having one of the few hd tuners out on the market however once i received the tuner i was sadly disappointed i had a couple of problems with the product one which made it unusable for my use and i returned the unit the first fatal problem is that the power supply has a low frequency hum i purchased the tuner for a home office and will sometimes work without any music i contacted the manufacturer hoping that it may have been a manufacturing problem but they indicated that i should at least not hear the noise from across the room even when the tuner is off it draws power for its clock and continues to hum the other design issues that make the tuner slightly clunky accessing any of the presets requires pressing a preset button before a number making every station buttons away the width of the display causes most station song titles to scroll and to scroll slowly the slowness may be based on the rds signal but i would have preferred to see the text all at once 
do not buy mouse movement is extremely slow it literally takes seconds to get from one side of the screen to another x i just got it from officedepot buttons are too small and hard to control joystick is unresponsive 
broke after months i bought this memory card for my canon sd after using it for approximately months with no problems whatsoever i took a video and the card just flat out broke first the screen said image not available and then memory card error i tried everything to fix it but nothing worked i lost all the pictured i had stored on it and found it was cheaper and easier to just buy a new memory card instead of paying to get it fixed now i have a panosonic one and i m really happy with it my advice splurge on the more expensive card from a reliable brand and it ll be worth it 
flawed dvd playback picture looked great via hdmi but unfortunately there was a major problem during dvd movie playback dvd movies would frequently stutter at chapter changes this was a show stopper for me and i returned it perhaps my issue was specific to my setup hdmi a defective unit or something else however i went and got the panasonic single disk hdmi player s and all is well except no disc changer onkyo tech support was not much help either they basically told me to return it save yourself the return shipping costs and buy the panasonic player 
warning i don t have a clue how this item works i just took it out of the box what i can tell you is that it does not accept a cigarette lighter adapter as one might conclude it would given that amazon and other dealers include a cigarette adapter as an accessory 
not worth the hassle not worth the initially this unit seemed to work pretty well i wasn t thrilled aboutthe copyright protection issues or the extremely slow time to load but i decided to try to work with it in six months this player often arbitrarily decides not to record sometimes and it often stops recording regular tv programming my wife s favorite soap due to copyright issues completely ridiculous now this unit will not output any audio signals at all stay away from this piece of garbage i used to respect sony quality i will never buy from them again 
terrible product service i am very unhappy with the product i received from tiger it was not what i wanted and to return it would cost me more than i paid for it the company charges tooooo many fees i am very unhappy now i have a product that i can t use or return 
ipod nano nd gen won t fit this unit sounds ok and the sound spa aspect is a nice difference however none of the inserts that come with it fit the new ipod nano i m still waiting to hear from homedics about getting an insert that fits 
guaranteed to break i bought one of these and it broke the first day i used it amazon replaced it for free but for no good because the second one broke soon after i got it too very poor laminator i went to office depot and bought one from xerox and it works much better 
not pleased at all i bought these phones very expensive to start with but i was willing to pay because quality usually is something you have to pay for they worked well at first it took about months to really have a problem with them but when it rained it poured i have sent back out of phones that i got and with the replacements they sent me dont work out of the uniden is replacing my entire set because they are under warranty but i shouldnt have to send back out of in under a year lets see the one is totally not usable doesnt turn on different batteries dont fix the problem completely useless the other one the battery dies after literally minutes of talking and the third just shuts off in the middle of a conversation with no warning then flashes on and off like i said i contacted uniden through email and i am getting replacements maybe i just got a bad set until they broke i liked them a lot but i dont think id recommend them after having all the problems i did 
print heads are duds i have had this printer for more than a year at first it was a great printer not anymore it uses up ink like no other yes it is great to have the individual tanks which is why i bought the thing but now the print head isn t working right do several deep cleanings and use up nearly all the full tanks up and the problem is still there the pages have splotchy black marks and the texts are only partially printed went to the canon website they don t even acknowledge this printer ever existed my recommendation is don t buy this model ! 
bad product support i set up everthing according to the quick install all setting is correct but i still could not print i call technical support on hold for minuts then told me he was not the right support agent back in the loop i go wait for more minutes nd agent told me the same thing don t waste your time calling thier support if it work out of the box great if not return it don t waste ur life like i did 
horrible i bought this to connect via monster patch cable directly to my cd player there is a ton of static and line noise introduced when using it this way if i could give it zero stars i would ! avoid ! 
do not buy this junk my drive fail after one year and a half this company really suck big time i lost all of my data all off it this is the third one that fail out of four of them i purchased last year total junk never buy a lacie again for sure maxtor external is the best ! 
warning ! unable to pause live recording i bought this item as a replacement for the gx which lost the ability to format discs a common problem for this model i was told by the sony rep that the gx was identical to the gx except for some improvements wrong everything about the newer model is different as in worse even the menus were different several features that i liked on the older model were left out such as a rd line input but the real shocker are you ready for this there is no way to pause live recording unbelievable but true i ll be sending this one back 
don t buy this it has quality problems you d think a radio this expensive would have better qc but it has bad quality problems mine was erratic on its set up parameters losing some locking up on others and it doesn t even hold the time a few minutes after a brief power interruption sheesh even the cheapest buck clock radio can do that ! buyer beware 
doesnt work well the item didn t work how it said it would the picture was black and scrambled at best 
not recommended not worth the cheap price very cheap materials and i ended up just getting rid of it 
wireless mouse not very good for a house with impatient people it was a little sticky at first by the time i contacted seller they broke it 
total rip off the other negative reviews are correct too small can t see screen the fit is so tight it affects the wheel i spent dollars on a little strip of cloth that actually makes my nano and nike useless if this was designed and made by some rd party it would make a little bit of sense but as it is i have no idea how they screwed this up so badly 
horrible when my sony lcd monitor died i had to replace it this acer looked great in the store but it was too loud in there to hear that the built in speakers are terrible tinny and not nearly loud enough and the whole unit emits a nasty buzzing noise that is driving me crazy im not sure if it s due to this acer s built in speakers or what but the sony was almost completely silent in comparison i will be returning this and getting something else 
didn t work out of the box connected the tv which would stay on for a max of min then would turn itself off i called samsung to schedule service and it took them a week to come out and see the tv i still don t have the tv back once it works i might review this differently but extremely disappointed 
dissapointing i record dvd movies as a hobby and am always looking for better media software etc i d been using ridata for some time w next to no coasters but figured i d upgrade and go with memorex this time around big mistake they skip pixelate and freeze up i have had to recopy at least out of the last dozen or so movies i ve done were it a compatibility issue i could understand but it appears to be strictly a problem with the quality of the media i m going back to using my cheap disks the lesson here is if it works dont fix it ! 
memorex software good or bad for your neck muscles this product is a sad joke it s expensive of course the paper is just heavyweight paper that s perforated so you can bend it and break out the inserts themselves which takes some effort not sure if it d be quicker just getting heavyweight paper and using a paper cutting board but whatever however the software is crap that s the appropriate term reading this i can save you an hour of your precious time no you can t make the template show right side up that s right to use the software you have to tilt your head sideways i m not kidding ! i guess you could also turn your monitor on it s side you can rotate the text so it shows the way it should but when you edit it it ll be sideways again so you ll have to turn your head or monitor back and forth sideways what kind of company would sell such a product and oh yeah if you re looking for templates for the dvd inserts nada they re not there ! 
almost useless after trying this unit on a trip over christmas holidays i tried to put in adresses to different destinations and it would only allow of them the keyboard wont let you put in a complete address the keyboard erases letters as they are being entered and shows several simelar street names in different cities other than the desired destination that was very frustrating when i did get to a destination it would input it when i would save that location what good is that after you are already there that is no good to me after i returned home i returned the item to the store and got my money back it will be quite a while before i buy another one i will wait until the technology catches up to where it will accept most all addresses and i can get one for a reasonable price i would hope that the more expensive ones can be more useful i certainly wont buy another one unless i can try it out first 
looks fancy but doesnt serve the purpose this is really a very small mouse and after a while just too difficult to use planning to send it in for a refund its easier to use a regular sized mouse 
good luck with it i spent hours on tech support with linksys and was told to send it back the product was defective so i did and amazon gave a refund i lost only my time 
only works half the time very frustrating experience and i am returning to amazon their return policy is the good news after a lengthy set up process i thought i had the thing running but to switch from linksys to computer speakers or my hardwired system you always have to exit out of media player and restart it despite the lynksys software telling you you re disconnected to get back to the linksys i find you always have to restart lynksys as well as media player and then it only works a quarter of the time rebooting the computer works sometimes to get it hooked up and other times after multiple reboots of everything i just give up and listen to the note book speakers this might seem ok if i could just leave it connected but it s wouldn t be because the thing starts acting up and dropping out the music whenever i leave it running for more than an hour or so i have no idea why in short a great idea but until it works it s useless i suspect most problems are software related i am running a centrino computer with windows xp sp on a wireless g network where internet and print server work just fine note that the lynksis does not support mac at all 
works great for about months i bought this card based on its capability of range and speed when i first bought it it lived up to its promise i got great range and speed out of the card i could go waaaaaaaaaaay across the yard and surf the internet at blazing speed with no problems it could go through two floors a few walls concrete etc without any issues like superman life was good after a few months i noticed the card started to hang i thought it had something to do with my p os laptop so i would just reboot and live with it another month goes by and i notice that the card is not very stable it stops working after about minutes but it seems to work just great at panera for unlimited time i once again chalk it up to my cheap computer now after months total the card barely works anywhere it gets very hot when using it and i am lucky to get minutes out of it at panera or anywhere else i tried it in another computer same problem i wasted and now i am using a year old slower netgear card but guess what it works if you are wealthy buy of these cards and just throw them out as they fail they work great for about months otherwise keep shopping 
where should i start it s a bad phone i have gone through three over months tried different stores and made sure the box was factory fresh the issues listed are the same for all three extremely poor voice quality low volume people on other end of line complain of excessive loudness so the speaker stinks but the mic is good callerid doesn t allow me to simply hit talk after receiving a call so i if get a call from someone and i scroll through the list of numbers it does not dial correctly cause it doesnt add the i can t figure out how to add the one through the menu the phone is junk and will be regifted to someone i hate 
got screwed this is clearly labeled a half height product i bought it for a gift and was embarassed when it turned out to be a full height burner 
does not work sony disc player does not work it won t recognize disc in player currently trying to get it serviced under warranty 
skype phone no good the phone seemed to work ok with skypeout calls however leave the phone unattended for a few mins and the phone times out and will not receive skypein calls it did not have a reliable connection either i am using wpa psk and the phone would often drop the connection if your looking to receive incoming calls use a landline or vonage 
are they really taiyo yuden i know that taiyo yuden manufactures quality professional blank media but these are from from it there is no proof on the cd hub that identifies them as taiyo yuden already i have had out of cds that did nt record any data during a live church service although the tascam pro unit we use showed that recording was in process buyers beware ! 
recording quality ok but no x preview nice compact box and recording quality better than i expected one major flaw though no preview when recording x resolution just a black screen with rec in the top corner dropping back to x resolution doesn t help this just displays the video preview in a tiny letter box in the center of the display a real shame i love the concept but the lack of preview is a real problem technical support claims that a future firmware upgrade will fix it i ll keep my fingers crossed but don t have high expectations 
you get what you pay for this television hasn t worked right since i got it and support is not so great i simply cannot get it to display in full screen comcast doesn t carry the id which makes setup complete guesswork i really might as well have bought a good inch set well i do get the advantage of the taller screen in aspect which is nice the picture quality is fine i have seen reviews about the clunky remote but i don t have any problems with how it looks or feels you do have to aim it pretty close to the bottom of the set right now i wish i had spent another 
power problems this drive may be excellent i ll never know i have now gone through two of them the first one let out a loud pop and started smoking after being connected to power it was plugged into a power strip that has no problems with any other equipment thank goodness it didn t take my imac down with it just received the replacement today it powered up for about ten seconds before turning off never to spin up again at least there was no explosion this time at this point i m done with this drive i ll be looking into another brand 
if it let me give zero stars i would have this phone is a total piece of junk and a waste of money as others have described the battery holds maybe minutes of a charge forget about it if you don t set it back on the charger when you hang up the next time you dial it ll be dead i m talking within minutes the beeps are indeed annoying as is the ring and the overall volume i can t get a new cordless fast enough 
what a rip off i purchased this product after quite a bit of research and after finding that it was finally available for windows i couldn t wait to get my hands on one why wouldn t i it s supposed to be the best thing since sliced bread at first it looked like a really cool product and is if your system is a mac logitech has done a great job of selling the nulooq to windows system users but only give you half of the software to operate it on there is no tooldial for the windows version a fact that they don t disclose which is probably the most powerful feature of this product i now feel as though i have wasted my money on what is a useless tool if you have windows and been totally conned by logitech what is even worse is the fact that logitech don t have any future plans to include the tooldial driver for window users so if all you want to be able to do is zoom and scroll then this product is for you and i know where there is one for sale 
extremely poor quality product i have purchased and returned two sets of these headphones the first set overheated and fried itself as soon as the batteries were installed the second set worked for a little over an hour before developing constant hissing and popping also the head band adjuster would not retract on one side making it impossible to fold them up for storage in the travel bag i consider the quality of this headset one of the poorest i have ever seen even frayed bare wires were visible on one side i recommend you avoid taurus products completely 
easy to use but incredibly limiting this kit is neat i have to admit that it comes with all the materials needed to make a nice little coffee table book however the kit itself is a little pricey considering that a there s only pages b the pages are only x and c the pages are not double sided the software included although as simple and easy touse as can be is so limiting it doesn t actually feel like you have made this book yourself instead it s as though you re in preschool bringing in the pictures and having teacher put it together for you you can arrange different page setups for different themes as you please but there is seldom the precise one that you really want it doesn t help that half of the themes have these cutesy scrap book elements that look absolutely ridiculous however the book itself is pretty slick once you make many many comprimises the only reason i gave this two stars is for the materials included 
one coaster for now i bought this on the recommendation of my dvd vendor s documentation lg i didn t expect it to fail from disk 
hmmmmmmmm well first off let me say that i don t usually write review s but i had to on this product and not because it is great its horrible the reception is awful i hooked it up and tried every station possible but to no avail i had to turn the volume up extremely high and the background noise is torture to the ears with all the crackling and static i am very disappointed very i am just going to burn all my songs to disc s or buy a plug and play receiver i wish it didn t have to come to this darn it 
speed dial unusable to use the speed dial you must first hold down the button to get the number to be displayed then press phone or spkrphone to send i d say about of the time when i used the phone button i got number could not be completed as dialed if i used the spkrphone button instead it always worked convincing me that it was the phone button and not something else i also had complaints that people couldn t hear me but only when i was using the headset which is most of the time i use this same headset with other phones so i m fairly sure it wasn t the headset i returned it for a replacement phone and it had the same problem i have to say that amazon has made the whole return process very easy since the second phone exhibits the same problem i ll get refunded i commend their customer service 
not a good company or mouse it is hard to reach the buttons on the side of the mouse they are worthless the drivers start a cyle of rebooting your system that never ends system restore fixed that but that is dangerous your computer is completly unusable since it does not boot support did not answer any of the three tickets i sent i could not ever download the new drivers and firmware since their site would not allow it i restored my system and am asking for my money back the only good thing is that the mouse movement feels nice but the ergonomics and support renders it worthless no good for gaming without the side buttons what were they thinking oh one other thing the mouse is rarely recognized by the system at boot or when plugged in buy a logitech never had a problem with my x and i have had it for over three years support has always been there and the side buttons rock 
wanted to like it but when i first started using this i loved it it worked fine in my car cassette deck and had decent sound in fact i bought a second one for my wife then after about two weeks it stopped working it would no longer play in my cassette deck which ejected it as soon as i put it in every time i tried contacting coby s support on the web but they were unresponsive luckily amazon took it back for a refund note that they no longer sell these directly bet they had too many returns 
not a solid item i didn t like it first i asked for a nano ipod holder and when i send the sellers a mail asking if my nano will fit they never answer now i have it and of course is to big to hold my ipod nano it isn t for all ipods like the web said and it isn t a solid item also it brokes easily 
disappointing this home theater package despite being attractively priced considering its apparent functionality is ultimately very disappointing im new to hdtv and hdmi so i didn t know as much as i needed in order to make a fully informed decision i have a sony bravia xbr oppo upconverting dvd player scientific atlanta hd box and nintendo wii game console this unit only offers pass through video so you have to have separate video connections from the receiver to the tv for each type of input hdmi component etc for the price difference between this and other receivers that will convert to a single connection you ll pay in extra cabling costs the hdmi on this unit carries video only no sound so you have to have separate cabling to carry audio from your dvd or cable to the receiver and then from the receiver to your tv again major inconvenience and lots of additional connections the manual for this unit is beyond terrible i m astounded that an international consumer electronics firm like sony would provide a manual as difficult to use and just indirect as this one for example there was a hum when watching tv that turned out was because the speakers while looking identical are not some are shielded and some aren t nothing in the manual about this there are probably just enough hdmi and component connections for the basic user like myself plus side is that there is no dvd player with this so i can use my own given a chance to do this again i would spend a little extra on a unit that converts signals to a single output 
good but can t see the keys anymore this is a great idea very useful to protect your keyboard i think that computer companies should always integrate this kind of protection to the keyboard keyboard aren t cheap and on laptops if you spill your coffee your laptop is pretty much dead so this comes in as an important piece of protection unfortunately in low light environment especially when there s still enough light for the backlight of the keyboard to be off you just can t see the keys anymore because of this issue of the time i m not using the protection the protection is very sticky on the side that goes against the keyboard meaning that when you don t use it it gathers a lot of dust very quickly beating the purpose of having that skin on top of your keyboard another good idea that really needs more thinking as to what material should be used so that it s fully transparent 
having problems when trying to download information to the ipod i keep getting error messages reading ipod is corrupt and it asks me to restore the ipod sometimes the software will recognize the ipod and other times it won t i have installed and reinstalled the software several times but it does not seem to fix the problem 
sent to old address never received it i contacted amazon when i found out it was sent to my old address but they said they could not help me i had to stop payment on it 
great for a while and then not so good this was a great mouse for about the first year i owned after one year is when all of the problems started the mouse now loses connection sproadically and sometimes it doesn t want to connect at all i have changed the battery quite a few times and that doesn t seem to help it is very tempremental and i have now given up and am shopping for a replacement so a word to the wise in my experience the mouse will work great for a while just be prepared to replace it in a year or so 
not vista compatible i was disappointed to learn this card won t work with windows vista i bought the router card together in hopes of getting broader coverage even though it isn t fully standards compliant pren i contacted support about the issue and they sent me instructions that didn t work out might be a good product for windowsxp but for my purposes i rate it star 
background noise the item doesn t work properly the video quality is okay there is a loud background static type of noise both on the tv and on the computer video card when i attempted to record a show the background noise makes the product useless 
bad quality problems with the keys i live in venezuela and bought the keyboard through amazon because he was cheaper than to buy it in my country and i thought that the quality of the product was superior nevertheless the product that amazon sent to me is defective the complete last keys of the acute notes don t work because they are hard and they don t emit any sound im really very disappointed and annoying with the purchase of this product now i ll have to fix it in venezuela because to give back it to amazon will duplicate the cost shipment plus venezuelan tariffs and taxes dont recommend the product 
audio quality is a disappointment i ve been using sony s ecm ms for more than years now and have loved it so two weeks ago i ordered the sony ecm cs to use for audio journal keeping while on the road when it arrived just a few days ago i compared the audio quality of its recordings to that of my existing sony microphone in spite of its pleasing aesthetics i found it to be a sad disappointment the ecm cs is a very noisy microphone with an audio quality far inferior of what i would expect from a sony mic i wonder whether this is because it is a plug inpower mic frankly i think i m probably going to return it and look for something else i ve purchased a number of microphones on ebay and have only been satisfied with one other type of compact mic microsound makes it and its a mic with a cable lead about three inches long i m not in any way affiliated with them but i would recommend their product with all of this said i think i still might spring for sony s top oftheline lapel microphone just to see whether it s any good 
didn t work right the first day the day i got it i was so excited to mount this and start using it attaching the item was very easy to do if you can read which i was in luck there so i got that done as soon as i used it it wasn t working correctly to start with i opened the slot to put the cd into it and the cd tray wouldn t close i had to turn the power off and then back on to get the tray to go back into the unit by this time it was easier to just do that then to remove the unit and send it back so to this day i have it in the kitchen but between the cd tray and the poor sound quality i dont use it as much as i thought i would 
not practical i have bought of these for me and my friends some were the gb version only one of us is still using it with no problems the skin of this flash drive starts to wear out and sometimes break its more of a show than it is practical also the side with the whole in to attach to your mobile or whatever broke for two of us 
canon sd review this printer prints fast but the quality is poor consumer reports rates it a best buy but i disagree pictures come out very graney and its almost worthless to have a megapixel or higher camera because the quality will not be seen with this printer i do not recommend this printer to anyone i bought the cannon to replace a hewlett packard deskjet c and it was slow but the picture quality was superior to the cannon this purchase was a real dissapointment 
save your money get something else this is one lousy expensive player as one of the reviewer mentioned the hinge on the battery unit will break i had the unit replaced by the manufacturer as part of the warranty but after a few weeks it broke again at exactly the same spot audiovox refused to have it replaced again because the day warranty period is over also it constantly freezes playing home made dvd movies regardless of the format of the dvd disc not to mention i can hardly read subtitle text i wish they had a money back guarantee 
worst souding best looking headphones ever i purchased these cans hoping the ney sayers were extreme audiophiles and the praisers were average people turns out the ney sayers were average people like me these headphones have zero bass none i love bass i have had pairs of headphones some of them dollars that have better bass i thought maybe these might just have a nice clean sound un poluted by heavy bass i would rather have a pair of tweeters on my ears they look so good though i actually took a decent pair of headphones and put the speakers from those in the skull candies let me tell you it s the design of the cup they made the good speakers sound like dooky so if you want somthing that looks great around your neck like jewlery get these if you want good headphones get a pair of sennheisers sp they have affordable stuff that sounds great 
not appropriate for all applications this adapter worked fine for charging and for sound output but be aware of some key limitations this adapter is too large to fit into many docking stations i found i could only connect it to other items using ipod cables although it will charge and allow one to play music from the ipod it doesn t provide full functionality when i connected it to a computer my mac did not recognize the shuffle this was the case whether or not i d pre launched itunes so if all you want to do is connect your shuffle to a car transmitter charger or other cable based device this adapter is fine if you want to use docks or make your computer connected ipod cable do double duty for your shuffle and for your other ipods this isn t the solution for you 
bought with an ihome from amazon stopped working after about a month i bought an ihome along with a remote on amazon a month or two ago i f i hadn t wanted the remote i could have payed about or dollars less and gotten one without it but after about a month of use my remote decided to stop working at first i thought the battery was dead so i tried a new battery didn t work i even used a voltage meter on both batteries and learned that both were completely full and functional i didn t drop the remote in any way that should have broken on it i didn t step on it spill anything on it or throw it across the room so i was rather upset when it stopped working and there no way i can really return it so now i want a remote but i m unsure if i should order another 
not user friendly the armband works fine but it is such a pain ! you can t see the screen it is hard to control the volume pause etc through the fabric and you have to take it out anytime you want to do something i understand that this is the one with room for the ipod nike attachment but i would try to figure out another solution with a different armband 
no quality just speed while this scanner is quite fast at running documents through i found that it could not come close to getting any of them properly aligned i spent more time de skewing scans than it would have taken to do it on a flatbed scanner it is plenty good for having good enough images for record keeping but useless if you are trying to keep higher quality digital records of paper documents 
data clears with battery change each time you replace the battery you have to reload all of your data don t waste your money on this one 
buy another clock this appears to be a very cheaply made clock the cover for the battery broke when first opened and had to be taped on the clock takes a d size battery not aa as stated in the description the optional full time light was good as was the ascending alarm setting time was very easy 
don t buy this please don t be fooled by it s inexpensiveness i am a victim of it i already bought this card and within weeks i started getting read and write errors i formatted the card and it now has mb of bad sectors unlike the other reviewer i did had gb to begin with but i think it is bad quality product and thats why it is dearth cheap it is not at all reliable now i am contacting their customerservice to replace this card for me 
i d give it if i could i went through no less than three of these linksys toys trying to connect my second tivo dvr to my wired network the first one the hinges were broken the second one just didn t work at all and the third one was intermittent i kept trying them because a my first tivo box was and still is using one of these successfully and b it s the one tivo recommends i finally gave up and bought a netgear usb adapter it is much more subtantial and worked perfectly plug n play when and i m sure it will the original one breaks if i accidentally tug on the cable or something silly like that then i will also replace that one with a netgear i cannot recommend this product at all 
output of the adapter states as v i am not sure what protection an ipod has but difference between standard v usb and potential v is huge only the ipod cable is useful from all this package and do not be fooled by the low marked price sales will charge handling and shipping so the bottom price will not be cheap if anyone in san francisco area wants the wall adapter without the usb cable it is yours for free but you will have to pick it up 
don t waste your money on these headphones i am on my second pair of these thinking i had a faulty power connection with my first pair within days of owning the second pair i m having the same problem you can be enjoying your music and next thing you know you ve got static sending you to the ceiling gets very frustrating ! 
nice feature set if it worked i purchased this item for my daughter through the military exchange based on the connectivity options it offered the item came in well packaged in a double box with qa stickers across the opening seemingly indicating that the qc department check it out before shipping first of all it appeared that the item had been previously used the batteries for the remote where nowhere to be found there was a quick start guide that seemed to have been crumpled into cellophane the unit is made of thin plastic and comes with adpaters to accomodate varying ipods once the unit was connected to the speakers and power my daughter inserted her ipod and immediately started playing music the sound is below average and there is no equalizaiton or tone controls to adjust it next up was the radio fm reception was fair apparently it comes with a loop atenna for am but that was also missing so i didn t test am next up the cd first it was an mp cd no luck a copied cd and regular cd failed as well there are more sources that can be used i e various memory cards but i had seen enough it s now packaged and ready to be returned stay away from this one 
faulty unit software after just months of minimal use the camera lost its green reception so now there s a only purplish red and blue image tech support says send it in for a repair shipping paid by me though i don t think it s worth it also the software driver conflicts with my creative zen mp player and caused problems with start up i don t recommend it 
only comes with one mount i returned this product it only comes with one mount i felt the description indicated there would be two i went to wal mart and was able to purchase a pair that worked great for less than 
this product should nt be in the market this music bridge is obviously a product that should not be in the market i spent at least hours in three different chat and phone sessions with technical support until they asked me to return the unit got a used unit in exchange after upgrading firmware in the router and downloading the utility from their web site to replace the one in the cd and three more sessions with the tech people my pc can finally ping the bridge and every now and then the utility can even find it no way to play music through the bridge though tried changing wmp speaker settings turning firewall off uninstalling and installing the utility everything i or tech support can think of also when the bridge is powered my network becomes unstable and the pc s connectivity goes on and off i have linksys router and phone adapter but if i had done a google search before buying i would surely had gone for a different product such is the number of negative comments i ve found afterwards 
awful sound stay away i have always bought and liked uniden phones tried this one based on consumer reports recommendation and because i wanted caller id awful reception too much background noise and you cannot hear the person on the other line turn the volume to high and you get feedback from your own voice good range which is useful in finding the perfectly quite place in your house to finish your call stay clear 
i bought this instead of the ipod this is a huge regret for me the iaudio is more an expensive portable hard drive than anything else the navigation sucks there is no way to organize your music etc like the songs are all there but they aren t seperated by artist albumetc it s just a big list as someone who has over songs that s a problem ! the provided program is full of glitches and despite many calls to customer service i could hardly get anything on it the folders would appear on the drive of the iaudio but it would not let me open them i consider myself to be a computer savvy person and if i can t get this machine working for me i doubt the average person could either after a month of frustration i gave it to a friend who could not get it working either past getting a mess of unorganized songs on it months later it broke and customer service was no help at all currently it s sitting in a drawer somewhere what a waste of money yes this iaudio looks attractive and offers more than the ipod for less but it s not worth the hassle the only positive thing i have to say about this player is that the audio quality is great but it doesn t make much difference on a player that doesn t do what i need it to i am not a fan of apple but i got a second hand ipod for cheap and i am very happy with it i also purchased the creative zen visionm and i love it i am kind of obsessed with music after a lot of research i d stick with creative or apple dont make the same mistake i did 
junk junk junk ! have had bad ones so far st unit had bad logic board and died after about week of use next one the power supply died within month rd unit had bad paper feeder th unit same bad paper feeder problems but couple weeks after warranty ended and hp would not replace despite same problem they fixed earlier drivers are junk and buggy in contrast we have a canon all inone unit over a year with zero problems and a canon printer about years with no problems stay away from this hp in fact all hp units as it will be a pain dealing with the repair issues my son also had a hp all inone that was replaced times in months he finally ended up selling the replacement unit he received and buying a canon all inone all in all replacement units within year between the hp units in our home junk ! junk ! junk 
needs high contrast display i m sure the capabilities are wonderful that s why i bought it but it was so difficult to use because i couldn t see what was on the low contrast even with adjustment display that it wouldn t have mattered if it had outclassed a cray i couldn t program it without getting a headache from eye strain if it had a decent display it would be great without reasonable input and output display it is just a piece of junk 
it does not work with macs they totally misrepresent this product it does not work with macs i feel cheated and lied to by memorex shame on you 
waste this heater is very quiet but it never turns on i basically have to use the manual option the heater hardly turns on dont count on the themostat 
review of netgear wg in an attempt to increase the range on my netgear mr router i got this wg access point but i could not get it to function i was told i needed two of them so i got a second one and i still could not make it work i gave up and replace my router with a rangemax wpn and it is terrific gives me all the range i could want letting me send and receive at mbs where the mr would not reach at all 
great features unreliable connections i like the features i m satisfied with the sound the user interface could be more intuitive however my overriding complaint is that the docking port as many other reviewers have mentioned is not reliable the connection is poorly constructed so just walking by the table on which it sits is often enough to make it think the ipod isn t there any more if they could fix this quality problem it would be well worth the but since it is very hard to get it to recognize the connection reliably you just can t justify it at any price 
mapsend shame on you amazon just bought mapsend from amazon they sent me version when this is clearly out of date don t be fooled it s a piece of crap this is devious and dishonest of amazon no wonder it was marked down avoid magellan at all costs avoid mapsend at all costs maybe even avoid amazon if this is typical of the stunts they pull 
the mystery of the sony cd rs continues i purchased this item recently at a local radio shack because it was on sale for in my case i did not get the abysmal product that others here have encountered but i did get a disappointing one i use an older cd writer nec nr a which is capable of burning at a maximum speed of x and i have achieved that speed with other media notably imation in my system however these sony discs are limited to a maximum of x no matter what data is being burned or what program is being used either the disks are substandard or they are not fully compatible with my drive on the positive side all the discs used so far have burned successfully and can be read by my dvd rom drive dvd player and cd player theres no point in buying this sony product when there are so many others out there find a brand that works well with your burner and stick with it update the current model number on sony s web site for the pack cd r spindle is cdqls not cdqls if you still want to buy sony try to find the current model number 
allsop lens cleaner i didn t notice any change in the operation of my cd writer after cleaning the cleaner was supposed to play music while it cleaned minutes it didn t 
died after one year fuser problem machine started making loud grinding noises when started or while printing showed it to a repair shop says the fuser is a toast replacement cost part and labor died just after one year so have to bear the expense poor design quality beware i searched the web and looks like i am not the only one with this problem 
do not buy this read my review first i bought one for my son at christmas and it broke after a month it just suddenly wouldn t turn on amazon was great with sending a replacement in just two days before even getting the original back but the replacement model froze up after just days and this time i am getting a refund to quote an e mail from amazon regarding this product as it seems that the problem with this item is more widespread thanwe originally thought we are not able to send another replacement so do not order one ! 
don t waste your money i was so excited to get this microphone only to find out that all of the music is polyphonic the background music sounds like bad elevator music instead of the original background music if you just want to tinker with karaoke this is the microphone for you if you want to really sing don t waste your money ! 
wrong selection for my laptop i purchased this item mainly to view the videos in my laptop on tv but couldnt do so coz my laptop is not detecing the cable at all eventhough the product claims that it works with both and pin s video but doesnt do so please be careful that you read the complete specification of your laptop before buying this product i am going for a pin s video cable coz my laptop has a pin output but this has only pins 
scratches horrible the first time i slid my nano into the case it put several scratches on the front defeats the purpose for even buying it i would recommend getting an agent case 
absolute junk backed up some movies and not even played well they either skipped or didn t play at all i backed up my harddrive with one of these and some of the files won t even open says damaged or corrupted files absolute junk ! i will stick with verbatim from now on 
didn t work so i buy my parents this brand new canon mini dvd camcorder for christmas and look for some mini dvds on amazon for them to record on i figure what the heck they don t need rw discs but why not go for quality ones the first time around as opposed to mini dvdr my parents are excited about this gift and we pop in the discs to start recording but the thing can t read the discs for some reason i read the back of the dvd package and it says some formatting may be required so i pop the disc into my computer and try to format it but my computer can t read the discs as well i just bought some mini dvd rs and my parents will be getting it soon i m pretty sure the camcorder itself wasn t the problem but if it turns out to be the case i ll re evaluate this product but for now it s no good 
does not fit this keyboard stand is rather shaky and does not fit into the slots of the keyboard i am constantly worrying that it will be knocked over with any type of vigorous use i have placed it against the wall and that is it s only saving grace 
alarms what is that the alarms don t pay any attention to the settings in sounds and notifications they repeat twice and then quit the light doesn t flash except the first time half of the time they don t work i sent it back for repair and they didn t do a thing to it but send it back to me the next day same problem it is the way it is designed but they won t admit it 
it overheated and melted my keyboard mouse piece of junk i used it for months without incident but it always ran hot not warm hot i came down one morning and the kvm switch was so hot it burned my hand went to check my computer and found the kvm literally fried my ms keyboard and ms optical mouse on ps adapter keyboard dead ms mouse had a melt mark underneath no joke ! thier tech support is overseas ergo terrible i sat on hold forever trying to get an rma all i really wanted was to make them aware that this switch is possibly a manufacturer defect and quite possibly a fire hazard they claim no one ever called to complain about it before amazon s review section proved them wrong and i told her so i went with an iogear kvm switch at half the price if that one dies i m going with a hard wired kvm box for more money intead of these all in one switch units i think it ll be worth the piece of mind since i use my computers for a living at home i can t take the risk some junky cable could destroy my livelihood while i sleep linksys claims they never heard any issues with this unit overheating or melting down components but if you search the web you ll find lots of my computer will not post connected to linksys kvm switch this thing is overpriced garbage and a fire hazard as far as i m concerned avoid cheaply made overpriced junk like this 
out of date this would be a great idea if it were not out of date this uses the rd edition official scrablbe dictionary the th edition came out in it does not have many words such as za or qi in it if there were an up to date version i d buy it 
low price doesn t make up for poor quality i was looking for an inexpensive way to store homemade cd s so i chose this item i would estimate that at least of the cases arrived damaged or broken and they are so cheaply constructed that on the ones that weren t broken the plastic tabs break on the first or second use spend a little more and get something of higher quality 
it worked great until it didn t i bought this remote with hopes of consolidating down to just one remote initially i was able to get my tv dvr dvd and vcr to all work flawlessly with it i wish the story ended there but this thing just stopped working one day it lost all of its settings and though i was able to reprogram them the learning function seems to be permanently gone i strongly recommend you avoid this product 
buyers ! beware of lexar s rebate claims i bought two lexar thumbdrives over other brands partially based on their rebate offers despite my methodical record keeping and submission i simply got post cards saying that i did not meet the rebate requirements in place of the rebate checks the first time it happened i thought it was oh well my fault but the same identical thing happened on my second rebate submission this is simply frank fraud by lexar on a smaller scale therefore not worth customers time to file a complaint or to pursue it further i hope the recent fines associated bogus rebates woke up these small time thieves and deterred them from deceiving and conning their customers again 
cheap quality no exact length i ordered this cable a few weeks ago although i must say that it does work fine the cable looks cheap in fact it is very thin and its length is less than feet as you may agree length does matter so you do not want to fall short when it comes to that so for including shipping i think it was not exactly a good deal 
corrupt files with my d i got about corrupt files when the card was new now after a few months the card is unreadable at all repeated emails to transcend have gone unanswered 
fast card reader but bulky and picky on cards i had a iogear gfrsd for a year after losing it recently i decided to give this kingston travellite a try major disappointment and i am going to buy the iogear one againpro fast usb rate and supports sdhccon compatibility issue even with kingston s own g sd cards bulky it is so fat and thick that it completely blocks the remaining usb port on my laptop exchanging the card is more awkward than the iogear reader the cap is very flimsy 
ethernet for wii console need a wired connection for wii console so bought this however couldnt get it to work is unusable to me 
bad sound frequency response is horrid at the low end i m looking into returning these things just a few minutes after opening the box i plugged them into my bookshelf stereo and everything sounded horrid im no audiophile my bookshelf stereo is a unit and i m pleased with it i don t expect bass out of these ceiling speakers but i honestly had a hard time getting any sound out of them at frequencies lower than hz i had to put my ear inches from this speaker to tell that it was on at lower than hz and i noticed serious attenuation of sound until well over hz it sounded like i was only getting about half the sound out at hz it seemed to keep up just decently above hz though i didn t test too much at the high end the advertised range for these speakers is clearly very far off i don t think that this problem could be fixed with a sub woofer these speakers simply suck even at apiece methodology i used the program nch tone generator to play specific frequencies through my pc into the stereo and out to my speakers left to one of my bookshelf speakers also right for one of these audiosource ceiling speakers by switching the balance back and forth on the stereo to play either my bookshelf speaker or this new one i could detect a very serious volume drop at all frequencies below khz getting worse as it got lower and almost complete silence below hz 
buy something else i bought two one for me one for my son he is so disappointed and i m very upset i m happy i only opened one i guess you really have to be computer saavy to use this thing the instructions are useless the software didn t upload and i have windows xp so i know that wasn t the issue unless you are a computer whiz save your money i wanted one for the both of us guess my son will only have one because now i have to go find a more expensive and user friendly one 
cheap but cheap this is the lightest mousepad i have ever felt doesn t even sit flat on the table 
pray it doesn t break i bought a mv in october and installed a second hard drive to back up the first the first annoying issue was that transferring the files from an external hard drive using the usb port on the media vault was very slow after about weeks of use the primary hard drive went down i used the online support and was told to send the entire unit back for service after about a month of not hearing anything i contacted the service center by phone here it took about two weeks of calls to figure out that the unit should not have been sent back and that the online service representative was not qualified to deal with the media vault in the first place the case was then sent to a quality case manager who said that the first couple of service technicians messed the case up duh and i would be sent a new unit i received a new unit about a week later but it did not contain a hard drive so another two calls to the service center and a drive is sent out i installed the drive and surprise it did not work ! another call to johnny my quality case manager and i find out that the unit that was sent was refubished perhaps a bad sign that refurbished units are available only months after the unit is introduced another couple of calls and i get a new unit a full two months after sending the original unit in happily this one has been working for the past months well see how long it lasts 
not worth the money i got this for christmas played dvd s on it and started to get the quotno disk quot reading i only had it for month i sent it back and they are replacing it since it is under warranty but they are replacing it with a different model we will see if it has the same problems according to reviews of the m model i expect the same i suggest you spend a little more money and get a better dvd player 
decent player with problematic audible file implementation i was looking for a doitall player for music voice and audiobooks although the iriver t handles the first two functions pretty well i advise you not to buy this unit for its support of audible files in this mode it works sort of but i have discovered several very annoying quirks as soon as i use the voice recording feature the unit will not save bookmarks in an audible file will not retain the last position in memory when i exit from an audible file when this happens the only solution i have found is to completely reformat the device and reinstall the operating system as well when the unit s battery runs out in the middle of listening to an audible file the entire file is no longer recognized by the player i must load a new copy of the file to continue 
don t waste your money and time the screen is too small if you want to watch it in your car you have to cover it because the back light is too week 
serial to ps no just wiring don t expect this device to work for all types of mice after you ve got one as you may find soon if your mouse does not come with a ps serial switch then this device means money wasted no internal hardware except some wires connecting the pin serial connector to the pin mini din connector is all this adapter does if your mouse hardware interface goes out serial only then this device is not what you need 
targus port replicator glorified usb hub this item was ordered as a christmas present and arrived without incident it also arrived in a plastic bag with out any software or even a label saying what it was after installing this item and beginning use with it it became evident that the video portion of the device didn t work correctly the monitor hooked up displayed the same thing as my laptop but on a second delay and the mouse and everything else appears to trail we updated all necessary drivers and sought technical support from targus it took them a long time to respond and once they did there advice was to hook the monitor directly up to the laptop defeating the purpose of having a docking station so with that said if you are looking for a usb hub this will work but if you are looking for a docking station with video as this device company claim i would strongly recommend you purchase something from a company other than targus 
wrong application not suited for use with radios even though this ac power adaptor was listed on the amazon website as an accessory for a sony portable transistor radio the instructions with the radio and the power adaptor both clearly state that it is not suited for use with a radio because it will cause the radio to hum sure enough it is totally unusable with a radio because of the hum the only ac power adaptor to be used with a sony portable radio is a sony model ac ehg which is unavailable through amazon or anywhere else that i can find ! 
customer service sucks while i have my projector for months it stopped working and upon servicing it optoma returned it stating i needed to purchase a new lamp the customer service representative said that it was my bad luck of the draw and there was nothing i could do but buy a new lamp on my own dime go figure great support i will never buy from them again 
small but deadly being a graduate student and living in an apartment i was hoping to find a cheap printer that would allow me to print off course materials and assignments it prints off things quite well and it is fast it does not however print pages per month pages per month is a more reasonable estimate and then the cartridges cost over which is high considering how often you need to buy them the item did arrive in a timely fashion and it arrived in the specified condition 
looks like a nice little print server but may not work for you this print server will not work with all kinds of common printers that you may have i bought the unit to unhook a particular printer from a pc that it s hooked up to and make it a shared printer the printer i wanted to hook up is required to be hooked up to a windows pc to function this is apparently a common configuration for a printer where much of the smarts to run the printer are in the pc especially for cheap ones which was the case with the printer with which i planned to use this print server definately check out the netgear support site to make sure that your printer will be compatible you may be better off to just buy a new printer that has an embedded wireless print server printers keep getting more and more capabilities and the prices tend to drop as well the printer manufacturers make the real money of the ink cartridges 
can t even use it i ordered this a v cable for a client showing since i didn t want to carry extra baggage the cable arrived in time but on plugging it in i found the cable damaged by a short in the video side since it only cost bucks i threw it in the trash and bought a more expensive cable at my local radio shack i m sure if it worked i would continue to use it with my ipod but alas it s history 
worst media ever made by cmc magnetics these verbatim discs are hands down the very worst blank media i ve ever encountered ! they re made by cmc magnetics well known as the worst media manufacturer in the world but not only are they cmc magnetics they re the worst of the worst of cmc magnetics the latest kprobe hangs when faced with these forcing a hard reset the latest nero burning rom hangs when faced with these forcing a hard reset the program continues non stop to display waiting for media when i use these and an attempt to abort hangs windows xp sp the same way it hangs kprobe curiously the media ids on these are exactly the same as that on philips lightscribe cd r media theyre made by cmc magnetics as well however at least the philips are recognized by all my software and hardware quite unlike the verbatims that s why i say that these verbatim are the worst of the worst from cmc magnetics the philips are no prize either but they perform minimally well the only thing that worked with these media are the lightscribe labeling but what s the point of labeling discs you can t even recognize let alone burn i had the exact same problems with these media in both my lite on lh ah burner and my nec nd a burner the latter is universally recognized as and ideal burner for even low quality media note that verbatim had a great reputation when they sold media manufactured by taiyo yuden but stupidly they chose to go ultra cheap and turned to the dreaded cmc magnetics corp thus they lost all credibility ! avoid these like the plague ! 
there are three different versions with this model number the original version of this router was version based on the same platform as belkin s fd pre n and the linksys wrtgx routers using airgo s v technology and a broadcom engine it got an excellent review from tom s networking guide then belkin put a whole new circuit bard inside the same case and called it version it used airgo s v technology and a realtek engine and got roundly criticized on the equipment forums for being an inferior product the latest version is which isn t even based on airgo technology any more now belkin is using ralink technology and it s essentially the same router as the airlink ar w sparklan wrtr or compusa s store brand mimo router any of which can be found in stores for about bucks the version technology bears no resemblance to the airgo version that got such a good review at tom s in fact the router with the ralink chipset the airlink came in dead last and was the only one to receive a rating of not recommended in tom s roundup of course there s no way to tell in advance which version you ll get but it s a pretty good bet you ll get the latest one the only way to tell is to look at the sticker on the bottom of the box this practice of changing the internal electronics without changing the model number is a really annoying practice it s hard enough to do all your research and decide which model to buy so then to end up with something entirely different from what you thought you were getting is just maddening your best bet is to just stay away from this one

no communication i purchased this item because of the low price however i got exactly what i paid for i have installed many hardward devices on my computer but have had no success with the card every device i have plugged in does not work this includes ipod camcorder and camera i would agree with many of the previous reviewers spend a little more money and get a better quality product 
faulty router with web utility config issues i bought this router and since day one i had problems in accessing the configurations through the web utility linksys support s suggestions didn t work i researched the problem and noticed that a lot of other people were having issues in accessing the router configurations through the web utilitiy i problably had a faulty router to begin with anyhow i send it back for a refund 
i paid dollars for this pleasant to the eye pretty sturdy construction small but only uses out of shelves if you want to use it for dvds ! i like the rack but think it is overpriced ! with shipping it was way too much money for what it is 
adequate at low power this system does an adequate but not great job of decoding digital s pdif audio with volume adjust for center surround and subwoofer it has several simple digital decode modes a fair value for but if i had to do it again i would prefer a lower end home theatre receiver with speakers which often start around these speakers show significant distortion at fairly modest volume levels however they are adequate sound for my small home office at lower volumes 
wrong product description after bad linksys routers and many hours on the phone with their tech support and being told that i must have had bad routers from the same batch i bought the belkin i was able to connect to bellsouth in a matter of minutes and so is the nd desktop in my office the nd computer is able to connect to my hard drive but i cannot connect to it when i called belkin i was told this router is just to connect to the internet not set up to share files and printers the product description clearly states share files and peripherals 
damn mouse this was a bad purchase mouse touch is very hard to control tried adjusting a number of times but to no avail also the screen says mouse battery is weak and opening programs by clicking doesn t work at times so i ve changed the battery and moved the pickup unit closer to the mouse but i still get the same problems 
beware this does not work with all tom tom gps products i purchased this adaptor because the listing said it worked with all tom tom gps navigators to my surprise it did not fit my tom tom one gps navigator and i ended up breaking the end of the adaptor trying to force it in look up the usb wall adaptor for the tom tom one and save the frustration of ordering the wrong adaptor 
defective returned i was initially pleased with the phone except that the caller id is not backlit so hard to read then i discovered that if a call was answered on another phone in the house the person picking up this phone to join the conversation could not be heard did troubleshooting with panasonic customer service and they determined phone was defective returned to amazon for refund chose a different phone 
very buggy product i bought and returned this after using navigator the problem seems to be tomtom has pressed some defective dvds i was unable to install the north america map or activate the alaska guam hawaii and puerto rico maps tomtom support could not provide a reason as the states and regions installed without problem there also seems to be two continental maps a gb less detailed us and canada map and more detailed gb north america map with more pois and richer map features i think the us canada map was stripped down so it would fit on the pre installed sd cards they are selling it didn t seem to me that tomtom support had a clue as to what was supposed to be on the dvd maybe tomtom will straighten this out but i would sure avoid navigator for now tomtom is a great product until you have a problem then you are on your own 
sorry didn t do the job for me i ve given it stars instead of because after i used this cd the sound from my system did seem to be a little better the cd s were not skipping as much but the bottom line is it didn t fix the problem as the cds are still skipping noticeably although not as bad as before not sure if this has anything to do with the fact that my set has a disk cd changer 
belkin kaiser napa feminine and not well represented unfortunately this item was not at all what i was expecting or wanted amazon did not have a pic but i chekced other wesites and found the same pic on each one none acturately represented the case the exterior of the front is very feminine it has stiching that makes in appear padded into diamond shapes 
didn t work apparently the remote control i got was defective and the only solution was to send it back i chose to get a refund rather than a replacement because i was so disappointed 
camera locks up frequently i m on my second dcs g i sent the first one back because it was locking up all the time the replacement is also locking up i guess i ll have to send it back too i would avoid this camera at least until they fix the problems when it works video quality and features are ok 
could be great haven t been able to use it yet got the phone and found out that in order to mount it to the wall i need to purchase a part and pay shipping and taxes now all the specs say wall mountable not wall mountable with an extra purchase ok isn t going to break me but somewhere it should state that you need to get an extra bracket in order to mount it on the wall so since i can t mount it on the wall i haven t used it yet have to wait a week or so for the wall mount bracket to come in 
great for four months this item was great for the few months that it worked i liked how i could just plug it straight into a usb port to transfer music i had just started using its voice recording function when it stopped working i was able to record a lecture and do an interview with it it seemed to me to have a good range and playback i typically didn t use the earphones but rather plugged it into my tape player in my vehicle a drawback perhaps is that songs are listed sequentially so it is not possible to select a menu choose your favorite artist and then choose a specific song from that artist but i didn t mind that so much the major flaw was that it stopped working the coby screen flashes on and off never getting to the point where i can play any music i can still use it as a thumb drive to store media if i want but it s a bit bulkier than my other ones when i contacted coby about doing a reboot i was told how to reboot it but that it was out of the short warranty period i know that no device is going to last forever but i think that i d like an mp player to last longer than months 
good idea lousy execution i have mixed feelings about this product the idea behind it is fine keep all of your cds dvds in one place away from too much handling the problem is that the sony implementation is mediocre at best the user interface is terrible so bad you almost can t believe that they d release a product like this you need a keyboard to do anything reasonable and the load info from dvd feature barely works and when it does it s wrong and uneditable the remote control is so poorly laid out that it s almost comical the most important button to get a list of your dvds is labeled folders and is tiny and in a bad location plus once all your dvds are loaded then what you only can support one tv i have other tvs and a dvd player in the car so i either have to unload them and the device forgets everything or have to copy all the dvds that i need to use on multiple machines if you are not sure whether to get this i d consider buying your movies from itunes and using an appletv or some other similar model you might also consider any fair use provisions that let you keep a copy of the dvds you rightfully own for permanent insertion into this device although the interface is still absolutely horrible if the remote and user interface were actually functional and elegant i d probably feel differently about this product 
worked for a while when it worked it did as described but twice it stopped functioning and all data was lost now when it is connected the computer fails to recognize it there are many better more reliable brands such as the sony micro vault which i have now nevertheless i wouldn t put anything on these that i didn t have backed up these drives heat up if you leave them connected to the computer heat will cause them to fail faster 
cheap piece of crap this phone sucks the battery doesn t hold the charge resulting in dropped calls and major aggravation ge should be embarrased to offer such a piece of junk do not fall for this phone because it is inexpensive as i did you ll end up spending a ton of money on new battery packs or having to buy a new phone in just a few months as i am about to do today this time i m going panasonic fyi my ge refridgerator is also a piece of cra 
unreliable died after a couple months i bought this adapter for use with my suunto xhr watch it seemed to work at first when first installed but on subsequent usage windows would fail to properly recognize the adapter sometimes unplugging and replugging it would work other times a reboot would do and occasionally a reinstall of the driver was required also it seemed to only work in the same usb port as it was originally install then after a month or two it stopped working altogether 
do not buy this product my player worked less than a dozen times and this was for minute yoga lessons if a company gives you only a day warranty you should know already that the quality is not such that they expect it to last long i try to buy from companies i haven t heard of to give them a boost against the big names their service department was completely indifferent so the unit is in the trash and the battery recycled now i have the speaker units i had to buy in order to hear my lessons and no player 
lousy uses an absurd amount of ink printed sheets of x photos one cd and about documents and ran out of ink not just one or two cartridges but all six customer service ay epson is awful e mail went unanswered so i called tried to explain how much ink i was going thru and how the printer would clean the ink heads before every print job but was told that was normal i don t know if the printer was defective or not but i do know that epson customer support is retuned and bought a cannon mp and i love it 
two paper cups and a string would work better these have to be the flimsiest radios with the worst reception around if you only want to hear the monster megawatt station with top twenty it will do everyone else beware

love affair gone sour i have owned this little hub for at least a year i have an older pc which came without usb so i added a pci adapter i soon realized that i needed more ports and more convenience than the two now located in the backplane of the pc on the floor i shopped around and this item looked appropriate as for the short cord i solved that issue by getting a usb extension cord at the same time besides solving the immediate problem this approach gave me the option of moving the hub to my laptop at some point and using the extension cord for some other purpose for a long time it did exactly what it was supposed to do i attached an external hard drive through it i used it for a compact flash card reader and a digital camera i connected an inkjet printer everything worked once the drivers were installed and everything was set up correctly this was all with windows se but after a while things started getting less reliable the system would tell me that various drives on the flash card reader or the external hard drive were not available or the digital camera would not stay connected to its software and the printer even started disappearing playing with the cables and connectors would sometimes bring devices back to life and eventually i deduced that there was something wrong either with the connectors themselves being too loose or with wiring inside the device either way it has finally become a big problem and i am shopping for a replacement most of the devices i connected were self powered that is they did not need to draw power from the hub or the pci channel at all the hard drive camera and printer were all powered by batteries or ac adapters of their own and the flash card reader which did draw power from the hub used to work fine it does not matter what combination of devices i try sooner or later the connection goes bad it is of course possible that there s something wrong in the pc but that would not explain why things are improved by messing with the connectors or the hub itself so i have to recommend against buying it i suspect it is discontinued and that this advice won t be necessary for much longer but i want to prevent somebody from the bother i ve been through just in case 
cute clock doesn t work great i love the design and looks of this clock and it s upright cd design however i think that because of the vertical playing position it tends to skip more than a horizontal player even with brand new cds also the blue backlight is extremely bright i have to cover it at night which pretty much defeats the purposse of a backlit clock 
breaks too easily cheap and definitely nasty they may look nice and robust given the hardened plastic ear cups but after a few months light use i lost sound through one cup then the other in general when placed over the ears you do get an echo effect of surrounding noise unless you actually have the noise cancelling unit turned on the batteries seemed to last pretty long though actually the battery i had in there lasted longer than the unit itself very disappointing but for the price this is hardly unexpected 
review of sony vrd mc dvd recorder after having a second unit shipped to me by amazon i had to ship this unit to sony tech repair to have the software updated so it will operate correctly with my sony dcr pc camcorder without the mc losing signal partway through a dvd transfer recording from my camera when using the dv firewire cable as did the first unit which i sent back to amazon it is only through the dv interface that the mc can recognize that my camera recording is in wide screen mode x and give me a wide screen dvd recording which is why i purchased the mc in the first place i am still awaiting the mc to be sent back to me from sony after reprogramming it for my camera and i hope it works this time if the mc allows me to copy from the minidv tape in the camera to a dvd in widescreen mode as it is recorded on the camera tape then i would rate this unit much higher say a 
not worth the money pictures taken in average light and inside are very poor may be ok for outside pictures software and ease of use are good you have to remove the screen cover to properly use it 
when it worked it worked fairly decently it doesn t make discs worse and it doesn t fix every possible scratch some people here think it ll fix severely damaged discs it is intended only for reasonable damage however i spent for the motorized version at best buy it worked and i d give it about out of rating scale on fixing the library s badly scratched discs but a year later maybe less ! it appears as if the internal gears are stripped apparently the gears inside are plastic and don t last long unfort there s not much choice on cd scratch repair machines to choose from i am forced to have to buy the manual version now or go back to what i was using before a drill powered buffing wheel and car finish buffing compound 
dangerous i used a previous olympus dvr model very happily for a year before losing it i used to operate it while driving taking notes reviewing notes erasing what i no longer wanted the controls were easy and intuitive and i could safely operate the device without looking at it not so this one overall the controls are much less intuitive and it is down right impossible to erase safely without looking if you do not pay close attention you can easily erase the entire contents of the machine this occurs if you inadvertently hit the erase button twice which switches the function from erase entry to erase all and believe me it is all too easy to hit the erase button twice so i decided not to erase while driving but then last week while being relatively careful and while looking at the device not while driving i accidentally erased voice files because i was not paying attention this item is dangerous if you value your recordings unfortuntely it appears to me this and other control design defects have been built into the entire series of olympus recorders 
buyer beware i returned this contract and asked for a refund but new ignored my first two emails then i called them and they informed me of their shady business practice that it would take weeks to refund my account i then contacted amazon and they resolved the matter in one day i read reviews for new and most people that actually had to deal with new were not happy the positive rating they have is misleading because the majority of people rating them have never actually had to use the product 
not a good company to deal with i ordered two gb mini flash drives one of them arrived doa dead on arrival i have emailed the person who sold this product with no response i would say that the seller does not warranty any equipment if you bought it you own it not the way i like to do business 
defective it stopped working weeks after i got it the display goes back and forth between ok to disconnect and playlist buttons for search and the toggles don t function either it is a great idea poor product 
save your money heavy short battery life rechargeable batteries last a couple of months then need replacing i do not recommend this product 
pci gigabit cards aren t going to be gigabit speed on the pci bus the pci bus does not have the bandwidth to get you gigabit speed you will be very lucky if you can get megabit speeds on a pci gigabit card even with jumbo frames your motherboard has two pci busses and sometimes has three depending on the chipset and the manufacturer the internal devices like the keyboard mousefloppy internal network usb firewire and more will be on one bus or the other bus and often both busses you will have to run sisoft sandra or pcitweak to figure out which of the devices are on which bus and experiment with which slot to plug this card into so the card can get all the pci bandwidth it can get but that will not be close to gigabit speed either best case on mhz pci is megabit even if you can find which pci bus has the fewest bandwidth consuming devices on it the mhz pci busses in all consumer pcs cannot handle the bandwidth of this or any gigabit card anyway if you want true gigabit speed get a motherboard that has built in gigabit or get a motherboard with mhz pci pci x not pci express bit pci or similar but you re going to pay lots of money for that worse yet that built in gigabit interface might still be on a mhz pci bus and always sharing bandwith giving you less than megabit speed it probably shares with other devices so you have to do your homework 
completely worthless when used as recommended both amazon and sony present this power supply as suitable for the icf mv sony radio check sony s web page only when you receive the wretched thing and go through the slashing cutting and hacking that modern packaging requires do you find that this item is completely useless with the radio emitting a loud hum that drowns out any reception now i have to package it up write and explanatory letter to amazon and try to get my money back then i ll have to find a power supply that is suitable for the radio i have a feeling that i am not going to be successful as one of the other reviewers has found so now i m stuck with a radio that will only function with batteries after it was presented as being compatable with a charger why else would it have a female input for a dc jack to say that i am annoyed is putting it mildly what a bloody scam ! 
stay away recent quality is terrible i ve previously purchased memorex media dvd r and have not had any problems until recently my latest purchase has given me infinitely more grief and frustration than the initial purchase price where do i start how about the fact that the media is labeled as x and only burns at x gray spindle how about the fact that files and videos have errors causing file corruption and or video dropouts stutter or dvd lock up i thought it was my recorder until i read all the reviews there has been a huge drop in quality recently if you want to gamble with the recent sub par quality of the memorex branded media and hope every thing turns out ok by all means make your purchase here for me i m dumping more than remaining on the spindle because the media is completely unreliable and worthless for anything other than coasters 
good machine but outdated good device but needs an update to the th edition of the scrabble dictionary 
the nays have it been working with mine for about a week and am disappointed to report that the negative reviews are spot on i too had trouble linking it to the pc ran into the hardware flow thing easy enough to solve after an email to customer support but they were vague enough that someone less experienced with the windows device manager might have trouble but the main reason i don t like it is that scanning is slow and not accurate enough really you re better off with dragon speaking naturally or just typing the whole thing feels like it s years behind the times the interface is horrible the pc connection is deadly slow the software is junk can we at least import notes into a text file wtf is a qnt file now i ve got to screw around getting that into a program i actually can use one really has the sense that these guys aren t putting any effort into keeping up with technology these guys should look at an ipod given how much they skimped on everything else program connectivity interface screen memory chip etc i have no reason to think that this is a particularly good scanner a friend of mine has a c pen that scans much faster but has to be plugged in c pen used to sell portable versions but i emailed their american distributer and found that they only have the wired one total disappointment as a graduate student this device could have changed my life instead it ll sit in a drawer reminding me of the money i blew on it bottom line useles 
sony srf mv s poor design and recepction i have been using the sony walkman receivers for years and am familiar with the product two major problems with this model first setting radio stations with this model i need the instructions is much more difficult than in the previous model intuitivesecond the reception is horrible 
great but hard to get use to the z board is great but if you are playing battlefield and then switch to the zboard you are in a fix the controls are totally different and very hard to get use to if you start with it it might be alright but i think the regular keyboard will be just fine 
keep your money in your pocket this speaker is only slightly louder than the internal speakers in my ibm laptop 
i returned this system in one week it came down to a choice between a sound system with a seperate dvd player or this system the reason i purchased it was because it would save on space well it may save on space but the functionality was reduced to nearly zero the cons audio popped in and out when playing mp cd s also a cracking sound when it actually played the audio hissing especially from the rear speakers when the unit was turned off low volume from the rear speakers didnt play many dvd s right it would just stop as if it couldn t read it will not read dvd rrwsstuttering picture it did this on all dvd s played every few seconds it was an intermittent length of time between ocurrences it looked as if it would drop a few frames the audio never varied from being spot on but it looked as if the player couldn t keep up with the dvd this is what killed it for me this could be because of a defective unit however i will not be risking my money on another philips player the pros good audio output that s about it my expectations were disappointed horribly i will not be buying another philips if i can help it at all instead i bought a sony slimline dvd player with a sound system and it is far superior far and it plays dvd rrws 
disapointed he didn t send me the product that he was selling the keypad is not usb and also it wasn t new and also it wasn t targus i want my money back or the real product that i payed for 
too bulky the remote is very thick you need a side picture to see how thick this thing is the buttons are not comfortable either 
no pc driver support from olympus as the other reviewer mentions the sound quality is mediocre at best what is really terrible however is the lack of support from olympus the driver disk that came with the recorder was lost by me i went to olympus website to download a new driver not available for download i called olympus tech support and the rep confirmed that olympus does not make any of their drivers available for download he said that he would bump my case up to the next level and that maybe i would get a new cd in the mail in a few weeks or a few months in the meantime i ve got a great new shiny paperweight don t shop from this horrible company until they change this ridiculous policy 
this is not a shure approved reseller no warranty had a small problem with my headset sent it to shure to get it replaced and shure called me to tell me that this was not a shure approved reseller and that they won t honor the warranty because of that be warned 
one word annoying f cking annoying there are no controls on the radio itself you have to use the remote your remote battery died too bad the radio is completely nonfunctional without the remote cant even turn it on off also aux in is a headphone jack instead of the standard red and white on all stereos you you have to buy a special headphone plug on both sides cable to hook up a computer or ipod to it 
apc es very poor ups i had the same experience as the reviewer on i tested the ups by shutting off the power at the breaker within a minute the ups software shut down the computer i had set for minutes so obviously the battery wasn t going to hold up long only load was computer monitor and router at any rate the shut down was successful but upon power up about seconds into the reboot the ups beeped and cut power to the battery backup outlets which killed the computer mid bootup and killed the router for a second or so absolutely worthless as the whole reason i wanted the ups was to prevent shutdowns during the occasional minute power blips i have here 
poor compatibility while the verbatim has burned well in of my recordings they fail to operate in at least different dvd players 
have some problems with the cds the first cd in this pack was damaged even before writing well i was able to write the second one without issues hope the rest of them would be fine too 
not as good as the d r in most ways i have the d r if you look at the reviews of that model i have most of the problems with that model there is a firmware upgrade available butsometimes it still refuses to use dvd disks and sometimes for no reason at all it decides for some reason not to record something however i like many of the features such as pause live tv simultaneous play and record the ability to use double side ram cartridges i have never had a problem with the ones made from maxell dvd rs and dvd rws also at the highest quality setting i have made dvd rs finalized them and it has worked in all the dvd players i have tried i also have an older pioneer dvd model which is probably the best of all of them except for this and if you do this the dvd rs sometimes do not work in other players onto the d r i have just bought these for both my sister and my mother as xmas presents but i had no idea they would have dropped simultaneous play and record i think a lot of the cheaper dvd recorders do not have this but the better models all do it also does not have either the tv guide onscreen guide which may be a blessing nor vcr plus as it says on the website as far as i can tell the picture quality is actually very good perhaps because it has a digital tuner i really am not sure why as i only have it hooked up to thetv with the rca cables it seems better than the d rby the way for some strange reason you cannot use component cables froma d r to a newer toshiba crt hd ready tv as the tv wants something calledcolorstream componnent cables and the d r does not use these i am not sure about the d r but some of the newest upconverting dvd players made by toshia do have colorstream component cables at any rate i will take two of these back and get the panasonic model i would have bought a pioneer model instead but according to their website the only dvd recorder they make right now is one with a hard drive although i may purchase one for myself at a future time despite the missing hdmi output or dv input i cannot afford two of these as gifts i hope this was helpful alex maasa maascoxe 
deceptive marketing at its finest the one and only reason i purchased this label printer was for the highly touted dymo stamps feature supposedly giving you the ability to print your own postage stamps onto thermal postage labels for no monthly fee only the cost of the printer and the thermal label refills according to the dymo stamps website dymo stamps gives you the ability to print exactly the amount of postage you need and eliminate the need for costly postal meters what the consumer is not told upfront is that these precise amounts of postage can only be in denominations of the dymo stamps software s choosing not any amount you want in fact the only postage denominations that can be printed are those already available in stamp form at the post office basically just your run ofthemill stamps priority mail stamps and postcard stamps this software also does not give you the capability to print postage for parcel post media mail or express mail and doesn t allow you to add additional postage for services like insurance or certified mail at all how this saves you any trouble over buying stamps from the post office is beyond me conveniently you can only overcome all of these limitations by subscribing to endicia dymo stamps backbone provider for a monthly fee heck you can t even go to an office supply store to buy the thermal postage label refills that you need to print postage on they can only be ordered online through a link in the dymo stamps software especially given the fact that even the least expensive dymo stamps capable labelwriter model is over this will not save you any money in postage will not save you any time and ordering stamps online from usps or getting them from the local post office is just as convenient if not more convenient than ordering the stupid thermal refills online from dymo and waiting for them to arrive thankfully amazon is great at accepting returns 
below expectations for a samsung application is dual input from cable tv input and analog pc input used as side monitor on a triple screen home computer workstation audio output stops intermittently a few times a week requiring power off on to regain audio there appears to be no way to disable unused source modes to switch from computer input to tv input requires one push of the source button but then to return to computer input requires button pushes as the tv cycles thru av s video component modes and finally back to pc mode a weak design the unit should recognize which input is enabled it is not possible to hook up all modes this is particularly irritating as this model was marketed as a tv pc monitor picture quality is acceptable for the application which is primarily watching news channels while working at pc or displaying dual pc applications 
techman i purchased this radio and charged it for two full days and got minutes of listening pleasure i called their number to find out what was wrong they indicated that i am supposed to charge it for days the booklet fails to mention how long to charge it yet has instructions in many different languages for your convenience i did that and enjoyed a full minutes of play time this was far from their hours estimated play time i returned it to the reseller and got another figuring it was a fluke charged it in great anticipation and got about minutes of play time for days of charging i called the number again eton offered to replace it but i had to pay for the shipping i didn t think that was fair and tried to return it to the local reseller after my days from the original sale was up luckilly the reseller took the radio back and refunded my money two bad radios just a fluke maybe so but why penalize the the customer and ask him to eat the cost of shipping to fix eton s problem plus the design is such that the bottom of the radio is rounded and the unit cannot stand up on its own eton said it is meant to be left in the electrical outlet during a blackout i d want it to be portable and set it just about anywhere go figure 
memory did not work this memory did not work still have yet to receive refund from seller 
would have gotten a higher rating if it worked at all i would imagine it was the cheap crummy power supply but mine wouldn t even light up deadone wonders why a component can t run on volts i d try it again if they re worked the power supply but not if i have to use a dc adapter like a item 
not for the gmr do not buy this for the gmr or ck radios it is not the right unit for that radio i have no idea how well it works for the correct radio but it did seem comfortable and low profile like it would fit well under hearing protection woops duh darn i need to return it for either an hs or s which i don t see on amazon i do not think amazon should take advantage of dopes like me by listing this as people who bought x also bought y i now know that is a bunch of bandini 
bag is ok i purchased this from amazon based on the description that a long lasting rechargeable battery was included however when it arrived there was no battery upon questioning amazon about the battery the customer service rep said he could give me a credit for the batteries i asked how the battery could only be worth he said that is what aa rechargeable batteries go for the bag is ok but don t order this if you are expecting a battery specifally made for compact printers 
a spastic gps the best thing about the magellean t is the large screen sometimes this gadget works like a charm other times it just seems to pay no attention actually the touch screen function decides not to work you can sit there and touch rub hammer to no avail i got tired of the whole process and was ready to send it back to amazon first i called magellan s help line the phone number was hard to find apparently you go to the diagonostic page and touch each touchscreen icon if you hear a click it s okay finally it works most of the time damn bunch of trouble and frustration for a machine designed to reduce trouble and frustration 
db broadband cable amplifier i was disappointed in this product when i attached it at the cable source it created probles for my broadband connection and living tv set i did install it at my tv on the second floor where i was originally having signal deterioration and it worked for awhile i would first suggest having your cable company in and tweak your cable throughput it shouldn t cost you anything other than sitting around waiting for a service call i no longer have it installed and will resell it on ebay 
san disk in pc card adapter initially i liked and enjoyed the adapter it allowed me to us a digital card to listen to music in the car however it no longer works and i will be exchanging it 
amazon rip off don t buy this product from amazon i bought this product because i thought i was going to receive ten blank vhs tapes instead i received one the picture that they have is very deceptive it clearly showed 
poor to middling quality breaks under heavy use i have two of these chargers that i bought directly from kodak for about each each of them came with aaa batteries which do not charge at all straight out of the package one of the chargers has become defective after somewhat heavy use battery charger technology is not all that complicated but kodak doesn t seem to have mastered it yet no wonder they were practically giving these away i d avoid purchasing these now at any price 
dead in one week my title is my review the thing worked for a week after that it wouldn t power up anymore chinese junk 
out of service for months i bought this samsung model in september because of the superior picture and excellent glare reduction it went black the day before the super bowl it is now ncaa playoffs and it has not been repaired or replaced the service technician has tried times to repair now having replaced every component i am finally on a replacement list with no eta the samsung customer service reps have been unhelpful and unconcerned the repair technician is the only person who has apologised and tried to push samsung with no success 
watch your pricing started to order this item at the listed price of on checkout the price was plus more for handling and shipping 
bad quality and bad service i bought this drive a little over one year ago and with years warranty around months period the system cannot boot from the drive and the test software provided by wd also proved it s dead so i mailed it back for a replacement and surprisingly i got back a re certified one with only months warranty literally my warranty plan was cut to year i didn t bother to call them to get a new replacement unfortunately another months after the warranty expires from the re cerified one the disk went dead again i would not recommend this model to anyone since within year went bad also i don t like the way they handle the replacement within warranty period 
very poor reception i live three walls from line of site to the tv broadcast towers and get very poor to no reception towers are miles from me either this is defective or a very poor antenna 
broken out the box this took out the package plugged it in and got nothing the power light would not come on the connection going into the unit seemed to be flimsy after wiggling the wire around i got some static on the screen finally i got the power to stay on and tried playing a dvd it played a few minutes and then froze up repeated this times put it back in the package and mailed back to amazon 
how the mighty have fallen i agree with the other review sony brand vhs tapes have begun a steady decline in quality over the past years as a almost life long user of sony premium grade tapes i have begun to notice a sharp drop in the picture and sound quality i get when i record even off my dish the picture is never up to snuff with what i see when i watch the show as it is being recorded for the past two years i have been able to notice the differences when i am watching something on a sony tape the flaws have become to big to ignore i will be buying tdk from now on and i suggest you do the same sony used to make a great vhs tape but i guess they are concentrating now on making more playstations 
piece of garbage i m very surprise as to how poorly this prodcut was made picture quality is horrible especially when it s an upconvert player to when i switch the to almost no difference the response time is unreal i can finish dinner before the tray opens the recording feature is horrible sometime it accepts disc but most of the time it has the bad error waste of mone 
too pricey not a good mouse gamers beware ok first of all it drifts ! leave it undisturbed on a plain wooden surface and the cursor begins to drift i bought it to replace an older ms mouse that could not clean its rubbery surfaces any longer yet i wish i had opted for a cheaper optical model i don t know if it is their trying to save on batteries while using laser technology by reducing the sampling rate i am not an engineer as a consumer though i find it unacceptable that a brand name pricey mouse would loose its target repeatedly while being used on a clean flat surface now try targeting with a mouse like this ! had to replace it with my laptop mouse to replay farcry gamers beware avoid to be fair if used correctly it feels good under your hand not for lefties thoug 
poor quality bought this drive in september now instead of reading cd s or dvd s it only makes a clicking noise sony technical support is horrible buy another brand 
poor product despite not being written on the packaging or website my hp ipaq rx was compatible with this keyboard unfortunatly the software supplied was extremely bad clogging my pda making it run very slowely as well as this it also flickered when in use making the settings for the keyboard very difficult to change in terms of hardware i found the size and position of keys to be the biggest problem while targus does include all rows of a standard keyboard it shrinks the top row numbers and the bottom row space bar this makes it very difficult to use the space bar which is for some reason split into three parts and the numbers which could have been made full size as there is nothing else in the way i found myself constantly not hitting the right key or not hitting the right key hard enough for the key to register in terms of key position there is a gap between the keys on the left side and right side of the keyboard making hitting the keys in the middle very difficult some keys are also very small eg the right shift key and backspace making them difficult to use strange considering they are used a lot on keyboards one of the biggest problems i had with the keyboard was the lack of proper arrow keys targus includes an oval shaped four direction button that controls a mouse cursor that appears on the screen this mouse cursor is useful but needs to be supplemented with normal up down left and right keys which are needed when typing to go back to another part of the document using the mouse to do this is very frustrating the final negative thing about this keyboard was the price i paid aud for this keyboard doing some research on the internet found better models ie think outside stowaway ir keyboard available for less than half the price around aud and bluetooth keyboards available for less than aud i think it might be about time targus releases a new model pda keyboard with a design and software that are suitable for the use the keyboard will get no more tiny keys and no more than two space bars 
honestly really bad i used this maybe times when the in stopped functioning but it mysteriously would work in reverse i wish i read other people s reviews on this before i bought it horrible waste of money 
please don t buy this product if you what to config vpn no support available for vpn config wasted man hours configuring vpn not working as of now looks like this product was not tested or certified for vpn poor functionality for vpn sad that i bought this equipment 
useless with a tivo the unit was ft from the receiver in the same room in direct view of eachother tivo wouldn t connect 
cruzersynch doesn t work no support as a dumb hard drive this is gb for more money than you need to spend the u cruzersynch preloaded application has never been able to transfer the contact list from my outlook express it crashes everytime it s also better to use synctoy from ms because cruzersynch only synchs deletes files deleted from the hd while synctoy has a contribute option that never deletes from the destination drive i contacted support i sent them the requested copy of my wab they ve been working on it for weeks i never expect to hear from them cruzersynch also without warning deleted my address book contacts from my hd not good 
false advertising claims the docupen holds at a maximum pages when i called customer service about this i was told that the unit s capacity was being exceeded because i was scanning high resolution images photos no pictures no i was scanning printed pages from books apparently the docupen can only hold around pages of normal text the page limit described in their advertising apparently refers to pages with a sentence or on them rather than actual pages in books or journals very odd considering it s touted as a tool for students a complete waste of time and money i returned it and now i m back to using the photocopier don t bother with this one it s not at all what they claim 
do your homework before you buy pny pny memory is not very specific on its products check and re check that the specs are what you need pny is more a reseller of dubious memory brands of asiatic origin not that others are nt but pay the extra and go for respected brands like viking and kingston you can t go wrong in the long term it s a better investment 
not worth it the styra is only ok as a replacement stylus it s not as nicely finished as the original t x stylus it s a dull textured finish instead of the shiny and it doesn t have the nice heft of the original the soft working end isn t as soft either the pen seems fine and is the only reason to tolerate the thing if it cost half as much i d be less negative but it s too expensive for what it is 
junk bought my go on november as a christmas present for the wife it comes with only days of warranty today is april and the thing is broken for a few days it had trouble finding the satellites then just went dead it was never abused never left the car out of warranty for just days wasted it is junk ! stay away from it 
lousy radio do not buy reviewing the fr weather news radio do not buy this radio it is cheap made in china and is a lousy radio you cannot tune it into a station it slides all over the tuning capacity is zero reception on any band is terrible the t v settings are all mixed up again reception lousy weather band too this radio is really the worst do not buy it waste of money and very overpriced it does not live up to what is written about it rating horribledo not buy 
i got this as a gift and i feel bad that they wasted phone broke after minimal use not a good shop phone the other reviews say it all stay away 
i did not receive what i bought i bought a xd to cf adapter as per the picture on the page instead i received as others did a pmcia adapter which is not what i wanted or needed for the first time i felt cheated by amazon and don t know what to do hope to receive some explanation 
intermittent even with the blue light i really wanted this to work since my older home has thick walls that make wireless an iffy proposition however even with the little blue light that purports to say the signal is great it isn t it works at about the same speed as wireless when it works at all and then without warning drops the signal and netgear tech support seemed to know less about the product than i did after a half hour on the phone the operator i was dealing with said that i should have picked option on the original voice menu which a pretty confusing menu to begin with now the fun begins getting rmas to return to two different shippers both via amazon going to ups paying to return the products not a happy camper 
nice small but extremely fragile i own the gb version of this drive it is tiny but still fits nicely into a usb port but i have noticed a serious problem the flash stick itself is actually smaller than the casing it is in you can see it on the bottom i have been very careful with how i store my super stick and careful in inserting and removing it from usb ports regardless the plastic shell around the memory stick is breaking across the width at the top and the bottom corners of the plastic shell that go into a usb port have started snapping off in little chunks 
not impressed i used to be a big proponent of netgear not anymore first off after reading the package on the vpn box i believed the software client was included but no once i figured that out i bought the software which costs more than the router after a week of hacking i finally got the software to work on one out of machines one machine hard re boots if you try any kind of network activity once the vpn is connected i ve disabled everything i can think of it just won t work it won t work with vista either no word from netgear on a date all other vpn software has to be un installed so forget using one machine to connect to a netgear watchguard cisco etc vpn very frustrating software 
locks up the computer total waste of money once plugged in it locks up the computer got in touch with seagate and apart from an e mail welcoming me to the seagate team i ve heard nothing since tigerdirect with which i ve had good success up to now will not accept a return must go through seagate so be careful if you buy from tiger 
not to be used with ipaq this keyboard folds out well and i liked the feel of the keys however the ir connector needs to be in direct connection with the ir port in the pda for the ipaq this port is at the bottom of the handheld the degree arm does not rotate to this area in order to have the proper connectivity you have to turn the handheld on its side this then requires another software program download not freeware that i can find to rotate your screen to the landscape view unless you can read sideways without getting a headache before buying this product check your handheld to see if your ir port is between o clock if so this may be a difficult keyboard to use 
slow slow and slow do not buy this product it is incredibly slow by far the slowest usb drive out of the dozen or so that i ve used it handles small numbers of large files rather well but it immediately chokes whenever faced with a large quantity of small files i attempted to copy mb files directories to the disk and it took almost minutes to complete the copy ! that s roughly k second deleting the files was painful as well taking at least minutes to delete everything for kicks i popped in an old mb kingston drive and was able to copy the same set of files to it in under seconds and the delete took under seconds bottom line is don t be fooled by the drive s small physical size large capacity and price point it simply doesn t perform 
targus does not issue drivers for my viewsonic v it worked ok for months but the kb kept on falling off when i complained i was told that the kb was not compatible with my viewsonic v yet it was advertised as compatible with the vs ppc the worse came when i upgraded to ppc and the kb stopped working i contacted targus and was told that they do not have plans for upgrading their kb drivers for this vs ppc i do not believe that this should be permitted if you sell something stand behind it very disappointing 
broken on delivery can t tell you how well it works as it was broken ! the cd lid does not close ! 
poor quality from sony i didn t like the tv hd sound was not working hd picture quality is poor improper color display on the whole its a not good product from sony none of big stores like best buy circuit city etc has this tv i guess it is because of its ppor quality 
horrible design thank goodness for apple they made a product designed well enough to get you just past a year year warrenty and then die i would hate for them to have to replace all these horribly designed dollar ipods 
do not like the charger and hours first of all the charger takes hours to charge aaa batteries i do not know if you have kids but that is terriable so you push the slider up and down to squeeze the batteries into it s jaws to charge it then gravity comes into play there is hardly any friction to hold the charger slide in place so after about minutes the slide well of course slides down and then it stops charging yeah now i get to start all over again so in other words check out their minute version yeah that s right minutes not hours rant started why would they even make an hour version sigh never mind back to the store all yeah and of course the down put in big letters only hours like the other only mins live and learn rant over 
disappointed although the graph link cable is excellent in principle mine did not deliver as advertised my computer calculator interface was sporadic sometimes it worked properly sometimes it did not further the cd rom that came with the cable was in my opinion of poor quality and was not user friendly the help section was particularly disappointing finally i found the ti internet resources for the cable to be substandard as well with customer support being particularly inadequate after visiting their site i felt as though they needed some competition to help motivate product quality in conclusion the ti grphics calculators are fantastic but their accouterments need some improvement 
not a real instrument this is a toy guitar i can not say that enough it does not stay in tune my son received one as a gift from a relative a couple years ago the only thing i can say is that if you just want to see if a child would be interested in guitar then you could buy it for that reason it s cheap enough it would certianly not be good for a child with a real interest in learning the guitar as they would be disapointed in the guitar not staying in tune and might then lose interest if your serious about a true instrument stick with the known brands and visit a music store to learn more about what would be appropriate the real ones child size can be found for around so it s worth it 
a sloppy piece of junk this is one of the best ways to add a major security hole in your network the mvp allows full filesystem list and read access to the entire computer running the media server there is no way to disable this feature also the remote interferes with my phillips television most manufacturers test their ir scheme for interactions to prevent this sort of thing although it looks like it should the mvp does not have any hardware display it also does not show song names from internet radio streams and requires streams to bounce through your computer my experience with tech support was not good either 
never received it this item was promised to me as a free bonus for my purchase of casio exilim camera but was never delivered now amazon wants me to review it so here your are 
good system one huge flaw this is a good product sounds great gets good battery life everything you d hope for in an ipod dock but it has one major flaw the ipod docking port is really flimsy and has no structural support aside from the actual electronics themselves after a little bit of use the connection between the ipod and the dock deteriorated to the point that the volume fluctuated up and down and sometimes the sound cuts out all together if they added some kind of simple support so that bumping the ipod wouldn t stress the electronics i d give this thing stars but without that it simply breaks quickly and no longer performs its only job to sound good 
total junk avoid just like all other dvd media memorex offers this is total junk i can t believe compusa would carry such an inferior product yes the discs worked great for about a year then the dye totally disintegrates after only erases and re writes as you can you see the warranty is only a year so i wasted my money memorex should state on the package discs will only work for year or after re writes what a scumbag compan 
unusually i discount negative reviews usually i discount negative reviews i think people may have sour grapes against a company or not understand how to install or work something i somewhat tech savvy i installed our wireless network that took a little doing i work as a technical recruiter so technology doesn t intimidate me i like technology so i had been nudging my husband for a print server so that i could print without going to the printer and plugging in he came home with this belkin product and went about installing it usually i like to research before i purchase a product but he wanted to handle this so he installed it and i went back and checked his work and he had followed the instructions exactly i know he had some trouble and had called tech support at my suggestion i would never have gotten the wireless router hooked up without tech support the only problem is that the printserver doesn t work so i tried installing the software on my pc and trying to problem solve from there i called the tech support hotline back and got an operator who promised to have a technician call me back in a short period of time i waited for hours then went out to run some errands there was still no message from a technician when i returned this morning my husband needed to get some work done from home he created a document and knowing that the print server did not work he wired up to the printer to print that way but now the printer won t respond to the signal so he can t print that way either so we deleted the belkin software and rebooted the computer he still can t print so i went back to my pc and tried to delete the software through the control panel it won t delete i am getting an error message i can t print either so now i am on hold with belkin customer assistance maybe it s a coincidence but as good as the english is that the person who refers to himself as an operator is i swear i hear a little indian accent that doesn t mean that customer support has been outsourced to india and even if it is that doesn t mean customer support is bad but my experience with this is that while i can get a real live person on the phone he can t do a thing to help me except promise me that someone will call back when i tried to get my problem escalated i overwhelmed him and he put me on hold i am still on hold i have been on hold for minutes with no help in sight i called back from my cell phone and someone who sounded so much like the first operator i spoke to said he would escalate my call to a level technician and someone would call back in hours when i strongly protested asked for his name asked for a number i could call directly he offered to transfer me immediately and now i have been on hold for for an additional minutes on my cell phone i am starting to sense a trend here my husband boiling over his inability to print an important document has gone off to work to print it there i am sitting on my sofa with phones going on in stereo waiting to see if anyone in cyberspace is going to pick up my call i usually discount negative reviews but this is really my experience with this product and if you are considering purchasing it i would encourage you to think that through a little further 
fast service but compatible i ordered original canon twin packs asin bzytg and received compatible cartridges a fast service is useless if you can t get the right items to the customer i complained via amazon and i am waiting for the seller s reply 
really bad idea i just lost my synch adapter and it is on back order everywhere unfortunately this is necessary to connect to computer and to charge the player earliest date i can find one is due to some shipping problem with creative labs i m at a loss now that the battery is dead this is the dumbest idea ever why didn t they design the player so that the cords attached directly to the player i agree that you should order a back up as this thing is so easy to lose and so important 
bugs in firmware the minor problem is that the user manual claims the user id is admin well it is not frustration and wasted time will occur until you somehow find out that the user id should be left blank to log in the major problem is that the unit only works for twelve to hours before it has be rebooted after twelve to hours it looses the connection to the wireless network once you unplug and plug back the power cord it will work fine for another twelve to hours i am used to rebooting windows every time it hangs but i don t accept having a wireless access point that hangs i am not sure how microsoft was able to convince me it is ok for an os to hang this box is going back i already bought a buffalo that works fine 
the shipping is slow as dirt i ordered this ram two weeks ago ! they haven t even shipped it yet 
wait for more information before buying works with my macbook pro with powered devices but was very sad to find out that it does not work with my inch firewire external drive which is powered off of the computer there is a power input no help in knowing how to work it on the side of the device adding power from a usb port lit up the drive but would not spin it up i don t know if it is a power issue or an interface issue with the firmware on my external drive belkin s site is useless as there is no support info extremely limited info on the product and they don t respond to email i would have rated them even lower but i have to take responsibility for buying it right out of the chute 
dead on arrival while i read the reviews on this machine it is clear to me that lexar has some serious quality control problems for some people it worked for others it was a miserable failure i am in the latter group sigh mine was dead on arrival i tried the device with both of my windows xp machines and in both cases it was unrecognized lexar tech support subsequently proved to be a contradiction in terms as they would not return my email requests for help 
i wish there were negative stars the dvds are a rip off although i m counting on the rebate to at least break even not counting my time the dvd player completely fails to recognize them even after extensive troubleshooting with disk management and ensuring my regionalization was not an issue just a poor product velocity ought to be ashamed more taiwanese junk id recommend verbatim s dvd r dl product made in singapore as a note i can get other dvd rs to work just fine i haven t submitted the rebate yet so no comment on the veracity of other negative rebate comments 
slow and unreliable the gb sandisk cruzer micro flash drive looked like a good deal when i saw it on display at office depot it was roomy enough for all of my data and configuration files was rated for usb and was reasonably priced my first choice would have been an larger version of the gb iomega i use at work but alas such wasn t available unfortunately i waited too long to put the sandisk through its paces or i would have tried to get a refund as many others have remarked it is horribly slow while backing up my roughly files i found that it was taking about a second per file longer for the big ones this translated to around four hours to complete the whole operation bulk deletes take just as long to carry out using my beyond compare file synchronization software to read the sandisk and compare its contents to what was on my hard drive went reasonably fast until for no obvious reason it hung on one particular word document this evening i couldn t even get my windows xp machine to shut down without yanking the sandisk from its slot the usual safely remove hardware operation wouldn t work after three attempts to read the same file and three reboots i tried to delete it from windows explorer and this operation hung too finally i was able to do the deletion from the dos prompt just like ! i then recopied the file and now beyond compare can finish its work without a hitch but can i trust the sandisk to deliver up my precious files when i really need them i dunno so it s back to the drawing board maybe by now iomega has come out with that gb model as for the sandisk i m reminded of that painful adage you get what you pay for ugh 
clarity of the video is very poor clarity of the video is very poor when we connected to the tv 
coasters i wish they had a rating for zero stars i bought the fifty pack and had good burns and coasters that s a success rate i subsequently bought verbatim data life and have burned so far with no coasters memorex has really gone downhill 
awful service by this amazon store i ordered this item on january it was finally shipped on but would you believe it snail mail i received a tracking number for this on but even though i went and set it up at the us postal site to be notified of the package progress i received no shipment progress e mailsand get this it was shipped from a city in maryland which is only about miles away from me date time location event detailsjanuary capitol heights md us departure scanjanuary us carrier notified to pick up packagetoday is february and again nothing in the mail how stupid is it to ship something snail mail when ups so just as cheap and a heck of a lot more reliable and faster i am absolutely disgusted with this whole thing i will never never ever order from this place againi will never never ever order from this place again i will never never ever order from this place again i have been ordering on line for a long time i buy everything i need on line but i have never encountered lousy service like this before worst service ever ! 
handset sound volume issues during conversation i really wanted to like this phone from all the good reviews but received one with issues returned it and received another with the same issues so it must be the phone model the below items do not involve using the handset speakerphone feature which requires a wait for you wait for me behavior just normal handset when you first answer an incoming call you usually have to wait a few seconds for the phone to make available way converstion otherwise you can say hello and the caller can t hear you and you can t hear them during a call using normal handset background noise and even regular conversation can cause the phone to block the volume of the caller as though you are using the speakerphone feature when you re actually not after a few seconds the volume will become audible again this issue causes bits and pieces of the conversation to go unheard this happens more on long distance calls than on local calls 
dont buy not worth a cent got it at walmart can t even remove a scuff i give it good thing i could return it 
did not work i was very up set this walkman was a gift it cost months ago it did not work right i could not get good reception at all it was complete static on all stations i think it was defective because i always buy sony products and they work great i still have the walkman my grandma gave me years ago and it still works buyer beware don t buy walkmans from amazon on line i susspect amazon may have sold me someone s return item although i can t prove it you ll be better off going to target or best buy in case a refund is needed shoppers check all your purchase s with in a day period so you won t get stuck with something that does not work if i did that i could have got a full refundgood luck frien 
one star is even too many i m sorry for this review but each one of my kids gets one christmas gift i ordered this item in plenty of time and never got it so one of my kids had nothing under the tree think twice before using this company its a shame i have never had a problem with anyone else ! a very sad mom and child ! elizabeth m storm 
poorly designed i bought this case for a few reasons i wanted something that fully protected my ipod from scratches i wanted something that would not interfere with the aesthetics of the ipod and i wanted a case that was fast and easy to get the ipod into and out of the dioshield performs fantastically on all three counts nonetheless the case only rates stars as there are some significant design flaws before i discuss these flaws however i should mention that the hold button problem that others have mentioned in their reviews appears to have been resolved my case arrived a few days ago and the cut out for the hold button was more than large enough to allow free and easy access if i want to i can use my thumb to engage or disengage the hold switch while the ipod is in the case however this does bring us to the first of the aforementioned design flaws the cut out hole for the headphones it is admittedly the perfect size for the jack on the apple ear bud headphones however i have shure ec s which have a slightly wider jack and they were not able to fit through the dioshield s headphone cut out so if you have after market headphones especially ones with a degree angled jack or one that is particularly thick you may run into compatibility issues more alarming the jack on my av cord wouldn t fit into the headphone cut out on the dioshield either meaning that i d need to take the ipod out of it s case if i wanted to watch a show on my television i managed to work around this problem by enlarging the hole with a dremel but still it is annoying and if you don t have a dremel or are reluctant to take it to your new case then you might be s ol when it comes to av cables or better quality headphones okay onto the second design flaw i m just going to quote a fellow reviewer h park who articulated this problem most succinctly and clearly the bottom of the case leaves a hole for the sync charge cable however because of the proximity of the hinges it s almost impossible to use the apple provided usb sync cable since this cable is the locking variety with the unlock buttons on the sides of the cable plug once the sync cable is inserted and the lock engaged a narrow object like a knife blade or ruler is required to disengage the cable this is super annoying and a puzzling oversight why even have the hole there it s like some kind of cruel joke reminding us of what we could almost have if only we had bought a different case finally and this is just a matter of personal taste and not design that whole lanyard thing just seems stupid the ipod with video is simply not comfortable to wear around your neck for any period of time plus it bounces around everytime you walk it is really annoying i ended up cutting mine off and throwing it away no one is going to use it that way and i m betting that even a modicum of market research would have revealed that but that s just me however i stand by the first two criticisms i made those are substantial design flaws that make an otherwise excellent product into a merely mediocre one yes you can use better headphones if you take a dremel to the case and yes you can charge the ipod if you take it out of the case but the whole point is you shouldn t have to do either of those things and a case that requires you to do so is substandard i doubt i m going to replace this case with anything else i have it now and while i m not overwhelmed by it i can go so far as to say that i am whelmed by it it does what it s supposed to and i can cope with it s deficits but i would not buy it again nor can i recommend it all that strongly two starts 
this product is great etronics is the worst while the quality of this product is great i highly recommend you find any other source to purchase than etronics ! all the customer reviews i have read are poor and this one will be worse they shipped us the wrong product they wouldn t respond to us to get the right product when they finally did send the right product a month later we got the bill to pay for shipping the wrong product back to them ! there is no way to contact them other than email this place is a scam ! get the equalizer from anywhere but etronics 
broke very easily the extendable arm breaks very easily i had two of them and they both broke within the first month the company does have a month warranty but you have to pay for shipping to send it back to them and i have been waiting over a month for my replacement very poor product do not buy 
way too pricey for you actually get i ll start by saying that i have found reception to worse than the clock radio it replaced for it s small footprint the sound is nicer than one would expect to come out of a small radio however in no way is it as nice as a small set of decent bookshelf speakers it just can t produce the accurate highs that come from a seperate tweeter nor can it produce low end frequencies with any real presence i am not referring to boomy bass here overall the sound is a bit tinny it would make a great clock radio if they improved the reception and it was the price that ll never happen though because too many people have fallen for the gimmicky bose sound 
daytrip you cannot put double cds in this product i think its great for single cds looks sleek but i would have purchased another type of media storage had i known the doubles wouldn t fit i have several

archos stand up case i bought this as a gift the recipient told me that the back of the closure snap scratched his archos wifi to the point he returned it for a new one i am very disappointed in this product 
this plan does not cover replacing dlp lamps fist off i do not own this product but i have researched it i just called the customer service number listed for this product and talked to a csr i asked her if this plan will cover replacing the lamp in a dlp tv i will be buying this weekend she looked up the answer and read off a statement i apologize for the inconvenience of your lamp burning out sir but the lamp unit is not be covered under our service plan as that is an accessory which requires scheduled replacement it also seems like this is not a warranty extension as it starts the moment you purchase the plan not the moment the manufacturer s standard warranty ends my first job after high school was in an electronics store selling tvs stereos and appliances as well as the extended warranties that are offered at those types of places sometimes they are worth it if they replace a common unit which tends to fail on a normal basis this plan does not cover the unit which is sure to fail on you within the first years and is concurrent with the manufacturer s warranty and is therefor not very attractive so there you have it 
great mp when it works i ve had this mp since xmas it gave me trouble initially then the problem went away since july it hasn t worked for more than a few hours despite cowon s several attempts to fix it this is the third or maybe now it s the th time that the sound on my gb iaudio x has cut out cowon just returned it to me again a couple of weeks or so ago the screen shows that the song is playing it s just that no sound comes out besides this problem it also has an annoying problem of repeating songs when the setting is set not to repeat this is a quibble however that one can live with given the problems i m having with it i considered rating it a star except that when the sound does work it is really good 
improved the new version is garbage it s true cl has improved this product in the process they ruined it for one thing they removed several features for instance the new version does not have the removable fast file and lacks the slot for a label on the handle also it is about lighter and obviously cheaper in many respects e g the sides are now lightweight nylon i would be surprised if one of these new models holds up for even as long as the old one and it s ugly brown stitching on black faux leather looks awful there is one actual improvement in the new one it was easier to open flat on a table and one possible improvement the attachment of the handle is apparently different but you can t really tell if it s any better because it is hidden on the new one you can t blame amazon the new and the old one have the same upc code but they are different part numbers old new ai am disgusted with case logic for this crass and brazen attempt to squeeze a few pennies out of the production cost at the cost of huge loss of quality i m not going to touch any of their products again imo they cannot be trusted 
did not work unfortunately i never got to use it as the ipod would not charge looked very cute but never got to use it returning for a refund 
not impressed at all will just have to keep buying new copies until something better comes along i ordered this on the recommendation of another amazon customer i wasnt impressed i though this would save me money because until then i had been just buying new copies of my favorite cds that were scrathced up i cleaned a few discs and ran them through all three processes without successful results it didnt seem to make much difference with any of my discs i dont think this is a good repairer of any disc thats more than mildly scratched my suggestion would be to just replace your damaged discs by buying another copy of your cd or dvd on amazon many of my cds i have replaced for bucks on here i wish i wouldve kept my 
immediate malfunction i tried my picturemate for the first time last night and it malfunctioned almost immediately it claims that it has a paper jam but it doesn t i ve tried pushing ok to clear it as suggested but this does nothing it still insists it s jammmed and refuses to operate i ve tried the suggested troubleshooting to no avail so i m now on hold for an estimated sixteen minutes with the epson support center all of this hassle for a brand new fussy appliance makes me wish i d gone with another brand the few pictures i got out of it looked very good but the macine took a few minutes to print each one so even when it s working the machine is still flawed i would strongly suggest another brand 
fashion accesory skull candy ear phones do look nice but it stops at that within seconds of putting them on they hurt the things are horribly uncomfortable and do not look or feel very solid the sound was ok but not great and not very loud even with the in line volume turned all the way up yes they do look good but head phones should sound great and be comfortable looking good should be a bonus not the entire sales point i am very disappointed in skull candy if you want good ear phones for a reasonable price go for sony or senheisser if you want a fashion accesorie go with skull cand 
worthless i ordered the year service plan on may st this day july st i still have not recievied it i have contacted them a number of times and still nothing do not buy from this company 
guess what it s not universal i guess this is a bad review owing to bad item description not bat quality turns out it is not a universal ipaq stylus set so make sure your ipaq is combatible ! 
very cheap cable i wouldn t say this is cheap in price considering the quality it should have been severe ghosting on a gateway vx through a linksys pskvm switch running two dells and two gateways with two machines running suse linux horrible reception for every single machine what a waste of money 
can you hear me now i wish i read the reviews and chose to believe the good ones bad choice while watching on netstumbler the product would decrease my signal strength each time i increased the power output even with different antennas antenna positions and computers got it yesterday sending it back tomorrow i guess i will move on to creating a wired access point in my attic to get the extra feet of signal reach i needed but did not even come close to getting from this product 
erroneous description i found this paper on amazon as an accessory to the olympus camedia p printer this paper does not fit the p because this paper is too wide thus with the p this paper is useless 
one fan made a scraping noise you re money is better spent on another product its made out of plastic so it feels cheaply made a nice thing about the product is that the fans are incredibly quiet damn near silent if it isn t damaged i had one fan made a scraping noise the fans are designed to draw the heat from the laptop but i ve found that these coolers are less effective than the laptop coolers that blow cool air in 
hated it this thing was a nightmare for us so much in fact that we returned it it never played the movies correctly and even scratched every movie we played in it do not waste your money on this thing 
can not block the fans noise from my server i bought this one to cancel the server s noise in my cube turns out to be waste of money not any better than the regular headphone i already have also not quite comfortable 
attachment problem i have been unable to use the yoke because i am unable to attach it to my desk drawer or anything else the clamping devices are unrealistic either i have to build something to attach the yoke on or cut apart the clamp units with a hacksaw and then attach it to my desk top with the center drawer opened that will then put me at a great distance from my screen in words of a syllable i m very disappointed in the product 
interior decays this is a solid case but after some months of use i have complaints one is that the stylus falls out because of the way the case is designed the other is that while the soft interior is protective it has begun to deteriorate leaving dust on the ipaq there are few hard cases out there however so i would purchase this again if i needed one 
don t buy this unless you have warranty i liked the iaudio but months after buying it it no longer plays in stereo and the voice record d n work cowons website is the worst customer service i ve ever experienced in my life ! you can t submit a question unless you log in but they won t let you log in because every e mail address you type in they say already used which is an error because i used addresses that were brand new cowon is too cheap to provide the support needed for their products i would never buy from them again 
all delome products designed obsolescence is the word that best discribes delorme no support 
nice style poor function i love the way this product looked it was slim and sexy the reality was that it was a battery hog the media pad was basically useless there were frequent bluetooth disconnections and i actually had to return it once because the keys stopped working i am not a gorilla typist i eventually gave up on it i give it stars b c it was a nice design but it just didn t deliver 
don t get confused this item will not work with pixma mp printers none of the photo pigments are compatpable with this unit i am now the proud owner of a cli pc ink tank that is completely useless to me i suppose it s my fault since when i looked at these reviews several other people had the same problem let all other buyers be aware and not make the same mistake 
very sad about this the card worked fine for my son s graduation and a family holiday but became corrupted during my brother s wedding and i lost all the photos from that event i still can t believe it happened if you have an ipod or other remember to back up your photos as soon as you can to try and avoid this 
junk monitor i have owned this monitor for a little bit over one year and it died on me right after the one year warranty expired the customer services rep told me that it will be for a repair which i can almost buy a new one if i pay the shipping on top of that i have other eight lcd monitors in the house and no one has such a bad quality i ll newver buy any proview products ever i will give zero star if there is one 
don t buy from philips this system is quite sleek easy to fit in a cluttered living room assembly takes about two minutes the instructions are very clear the sound is amazing especially when you put on your favorite loud bass heavy film why then do i give it one star it skips like nobody s business at first my wife and i thought it was the disks we were putting in as many of them were scratched but then we put in new disks no difference when exactly does it skip impossible to tell sometimes a little sometimes every frame ! sometimes it ll tell us that disks are bad then the next time we put them in they magically work until they skip so i called philips and they said that not only would we have to pay for shipping but they could not guarantee that they would fix it and it would take up to a month before they d ship it back save your money ! buy from someone else 
what a waste of money we purchased our dvd player in june from hh gregg for by december the screen would sometimes turn white so that we couldn t see the picture within a few months the screen stayed white all of the time so that now we cannot play dvds at all audiovox wants to fix it i m sure thats the cost of replacing it the sound quality was never great but we endured it what a complete waste of money and theres no way i m sending audiovox another for this or any other product 
another dissatisfied customer not only was this difficult to set up even a generally polite but sadly ill informed technical helper from belkin was baffled regarding the simplest steps and keyphrases but once i finally managed to get it to work by simply as a last resort resetting the router with a paper clip it had practically no range whatsoever in fact my macbook pro placed within inches of the router itself only received a signal and once the threshold of the room was crossed the signal disappeared altogether a free four year old linksys router which i received with my earthlink home networking package and which this belkin was supposed to replace always worked with a full signal everywhere in the house and rarely failed and linksys is supposed to be notoriously mac unfriendly anyway i hope that there are enough ups trucks in america to handle the returns that this item mine included will require 
adapter but no cable note that this product includes only the ac adapter but no additonal cabling to attach to the zune so if you were thinking about having one cable to hook to your pc and another to charge if you are away from you pc remember to take the zune cable with you for i expected them to include the cent cable 
kingston gb sd memory card this sd would not work in my nikon coolpix s camera but the fuji and sandisk product did 
philips gives poor customer support after we used and liked the phone for two weeks the handset developed severe static when we contacted philips customer support they agreed it was a defective handset and gave us an address to which we could return the handset for repair or replacement our poatal service record of receipt indicates they received it on october for more than two months we made numerous phone calls spoke to many different persons and were promised callbacks that never came finally a supervisor assured us that a handset was in the mail that was more than three weeks ago we plan to keep trying to get some satisfaction but meanwhile we have lost any shred of confidence we ever had in this manufacturer 
not what i expected i purchased this dvd recorder to go with the sony hdd camcorder they should have been perfectly compatible but mine has been nothing but trouble the first time i used it it simply froze at complete and i had to shut it down and start over after waiting hours for it to finish after that it recorded from the camera but seemingly randomly not in the order i videotaped on the camera and incompletely burned video segments from the camera as well plus there is no editing capability whatsoever with this device i use very high quality taiyo yuden dvd s in it so i know it is not the discs 
it worked at first when i first got the mp player it was great it worked fine and i was very pleased with its battery life but then only weeks after i bought the product it broke and unfortunately for me i threw away the box and everything that came with it once i thought it was working satisfactorily oh well all i have to say is if given the chance i would not have bought the product in the first place and regret doing so now 
the good the bad and the really bad i ve often wondered how many people review things on amazon when they first buy them had i done so i d have posted only the good and would have forgotten by the time it got really bad the good when i first purchased of these my first run to a customer went fantastically well i copied the files via windows explorer to the drive which showed up in my computer under windows as you d expect and presto no problems the bad sometimes the drive won t turn off by the power button on the front sometimes it will it s like my year old child it s got an unreasonable and emotionally uncontrollable reaction to what you do customer support is crazy crazy ! i spent a long long time explaining my problem what i d done to solve it the steps i took and provided a screen shot only to wait a day and get an automated response which had nothing to do with the problem and i d already reviewed prior to submitting the question because they force you to and the person who responded proceeded to provide feedback and steps that did not address the issue solve the problem or leave me with the impression that he understood what he was doing the first backup performed with their software took overnight that s fine it really was gb of uncompressed data on a windows drive but when it was done it wasn t their backup software puts it s own restore binaries in the directory you created at backup time and for this one it didn t it seems the backup software is unable to backup when you input over gb of data at a go the workaround though is to break it up into smaller chunks pita when you have a system for filing within your windows directories but livable considering the bigger pita to backup to dvd the drive makes not so nice sounds when shutting down yes it s a known issue they say it s not an issue but when you shell out a lot of money on your drive your heart stops for a moment when you hear a painful clicking sound you know the sound your drive makes a day or two before it stops working yup it s that one for what it s worth i ve had the drives on for roughly a month without a problem but you should be aware that it ll be a little strange the first time you hear it the really bad the backup software refuses to work the problem i have is that it wasn t predictable in how it chose to stop working i installed the drive did a backup that overnight backup which failed the next morning i did the backup in smaller chunks and when i came back from work sure enough it was fine great i performed more backups over the course of a week no problems last week i launched the software selected the folders i wanted to backup even selected the files and the software insists on telling me please select the files to be backed up nothing changes this message i d removed the drivers software rebooted reinstalled uninstalled just the backup software reinstalled it doesn t matter it just simply refuses to work the diagnostic tool that their website and their techical support people will tell you to use is useless when you launch it it does a smartscan which if things are fine it says pass and you think great the problem is when it says info unavailable what does that mean you check the help files right there s nothing in there that mentions what it means or mentions it at all so i reviewed the responses i got from technical support which provided me a link and the information in the link simply reiterated their software help info which was useless i m a self service junkie i don t want to call you i don t want to email you if i have a problem i want to read the manual or your website or your forum while i don t really believe i m the first to have a problem with their backup software i absolutely refuse to believe i must have been the first one to ask what info unavailable means help me help you help me ! i think for me the issue is now trust i think the data on the hd is fine but considering the application stopped working out of the blue who s to say the application in each directory i made a backup of on this drive won t stop working too it works today but there s no telling if it ll work tomorrow yes i could manually copy the files but when you re backing up tb of data incremental backups really are the way to go another potential workaround is to purchase another vendor s backup software which i ve done and not yet tried but this is wholly not the point don t shlep cheap and buggy software off charge more than the version of the product without it and market it as backup software that provides the world in gold that s just wrong and frustrating as a result i won t be buying this drive again i highly recommend you don t either there are plenty of competing products on the market already and if you re going to buy someone else s backup software you might as well buy a hard drive from a vendor that invests in competent online and software support after all as of today what were you spending that extra on 
would not buy it again works in suburban gain is too high and not adjustable so when changing tfrom radio ro cd to ipod it blasts you with volume and also the sound quality is compromised by the too high gain it does not charge the ipod nor can it be connected to a charger because it necessarily uses the docking port on the ipod belkin makes made a charger that plugged into the docking port and then accepted an earphone jack from a separate tape the belkin solution had a gain adjustment which was very useful but it was not possible to use the vehichle s tape cd controls to control the ipod using the tape cd controls works for on and off and it is great that the ipod stops when i switch to the radio or turn the car audio off going to the next song or backwards works with a delay that is not terrible when i use the car controls i am in shuffle mode so it s ok if i want to find a particular song i pick up the ipod if the smartdeck was had gain adjustment and a charger it would be a lot better we really need to pop the ipod into a hole in the dash and control it completely from the dash with all the ipod screen infor visible on the car stereo until then the smartdeck is a couple steps forward and a couple steps back becasue of the gain issue i would not buy it again unless it had a gain adjustment 
painful set up poor range having had very good luck with two belkin g routers i thought that the g would be a no brainer not first of all the router would not install at all from windows i called customer support and after interminable waits and two tech support people who were very polite we finally decided to install from another computer with windows xp all seemed to be going along fine the router installed but did not allow me to set a security password for the wireless in the regular set up process like their g router setups did only when i logged on wirelessly it let me set a password meaning had any of my bandwidth thieving neighbors tried to log on before me it would have been them setting my password which would have effectively locked me out of the wireless it also came without a user s guide though that is listed on the box contents and the cd rom also was supposed to have a user s manual but when i clicked on the user manual tab nothing came up ! after all was said and done i did manage to get my xp system connected but the windows would not connect even with a cable it was working fine on a linksys direct cable before overall a very painfully long installation that was not windows compatible or perhaps a firewall problem items left out of the package and a big step down in ease of installation from their g router and if that isn t bad enough the signal strength was no improvement over the linksys g router i was replacing belkin sorry this product was below your previous standard this one s going back to best buy 
works fine but only have memory for names names is pathetic should be at least or 
a gamble it s a gamble it may work for you in your stereo and city it just doesn t work for me in my stereo and my city it almost works if i hold onto it but upon letting go comes the sound of static interference it s an ugly sound im going for the hardwired fm transmitter a more involved install but no noise 
case logic neoprene dvd player shuttle requested a return authorization the day received it was not what we thought we ordered it has been weeks and still no authorization code 
don t buy mine didn t last long i bought a pv d about a year ago it worked for a while now it won t read old disks and even with brand new disks the chance ofit being able to read the disk are not good about of the brand new disks i have triedit won t read i will never buy another panasonic product again 
didn t help a bit i bought this to extend the range of my access point in my sq ft flat i had my access point at the far end of the house from where i wanted to connect some of the time this antenna made no difference i ended up moving my access point to resolve the problem 
not worth the price tag the sound isolating is not as good as people rave about yes it does decrease the amount of outside sound you hear but it doesn t block it entirely as many people seem to rave if you listen to something with a lot going on like the white stripes and play it a little loud then yes you cannot hear outside sound but if you listen to classical spoken word alt country for example and you do not crank the volume you will still hear people talking on their cell phones the sound of the subway the co worker on speakerphone cubes away i wish i hadn t spent on this model and had just gone for the e instead plus the cord is such a pain the wear it over your ear style feels uncomfortable and the cord never stays over my ear and always needs attention and re arranging 
acquiring signal for eternity i purchased this receiver in december it worked like a champ until february when it began to have issues with decoding the satellite signal the unit works for five minutes from cold start up then the audio cuts out display still shows program info being an experienced pc user i turned the unit off and back on repeatedly the message acquiring signal displays permanently even though the antenna aiming screen shows full sat and ter signal bars my best guess is that a rom or ram chip cooked this unit runs hot ! jvc has been less than helpful it sucks to have to landfill a piece of hardware but no one will touch it it s my last purchase from jvc glad i didn t purchase the sirius lifetime license 
almost the duet mic worked for a few sessions then it just did not sync with its master unit i had to return it amazon customer service was great and i eventually received a credit for the unit 
tray locked after use sony service sucks the child proof tray lock feature is an absolute nightmare there is software issue with this player this feature was activated by itself and wouldn t unlock following the procedure in the manual sony support is totally useless they recommended steps that i have already tried the support person was obviously reading from a template as it took him probably doing support from india minutes to respond to every simple question after struggling for hour he finally concluded that the unit needs to be sent back the player is only accepted at sony s texas service location sony doesn t provide service locally even though there are tons of sony stores in my area not only i have to pay shipping out of my own pocket the turn around time will be about a month worst yet the fine print in the support agreement says sony will ship me back another refurbished unit i will think twice before buying sony again

didn t work ! don t waste your time i got this tape recorder and plugged it in but the tape heads wouldn t even turn it made some sort of noise and that was the end of that i had to return it for a refund it felt very light and cheaply made too bad i liked the looks of it i am going to try another shoe box recorder from a different company 
feature set is great but the fm is pure junk long periods of garbled static mixed with random brief moments of actual fm reception this is in town trying to receive a major station i am packaging this up and its going back today this is my second try with sony that has miserably failed guess maybe i should be looking at another mfg 
my roommate s broke then mine broke my roommate s mouse broke she had the older l shaped receiver and i thought it was because she s bad with technology but i m a computer junkie who knows how to take care of her technical equipment and even mine broke a few months later i had a straight receiver it just gave up on me not a battery issue more like a connection issue now i read all these reviews about it breaking on people well i ll write back when my other roommate s break and when my cousin s break dont get me wrong but it was great while it lasted less than half a year gonna go back to my logitech that never broke on me 
horrible pda dictionary my main annoyance was all of the screens i had to go through just to look up a word ! it vexed me terribly when it finally broke it gave me the excuse to buy another dictionary but certainly not this one ! i chose handmark s oxford dictionary which i am pleased with 
device not worth the investment i did own this router for almost months linksys wrtgx v in the past i did owned those routers for at least months linksys befws v stars netgear mr v stars d link revc stars linksys wrtg v stars ive bought this router for couple reasons i wanted to have a router with qos feature and gives a good signal it turned to be very disappointing at least for linksys wrtgx v it never delivered a good connection speed my wireless client g speed was around mbps sometimes and i was only a wall away and ft from the router not mentioning some dead spots it felt as if you were connected through a dial up i have changed advanced wireless settings flashed to the latest firmware changed to different channel but it did not solve the problem the device will lockup after or hours of activity but not every time the wap feature used to reject any client after group key renewal expired but it was fixed with firmware ive contacted linksys customer support and they told me the router was faulty i am very suspicious because a lot of people had the same issue i am not sure if it has something related with linksys wrtgx v there is a v i haven t tried with srx wireless client device but regardless the case i think it should work with standard g client do not buy this device not worth the investment i ve bought linksys wrtg v and it works much better than this one i think it s a device where linksys needs to work a lot before it becomes stable and usable 
sure they re cute but sure these colorful jewel cases are pretty to look at but i give their functionality an f as soon as i opened one of these cases to put a cd in it the case broke it happened to cases out of the i have used already i wasn t using excessive force in fact most people call me gentle buy at your own risk and handle with care ! 
a piece of garbage this was the worst electronics puchase i ve ever made when i first got the mini it was great looked nice and sounded great within about months battery life started to go way down after a year it was down to nothing didn t work properly would show a full charge and not last more than minutes if you re going to take a chance on an ipod definitely get a newer different model that may be of better quality than this one 
powered they mislead me into thinking the power for the signal booster comes from the my existing cable great ! what is actually needed is to plug in the supplied ac dc converter and install this length of powered cable inline with the antennae cable crap 
not the best out of the disks would not write i didnt much care for the product considering this factor 
what s up with this dvd my friend bought these dvd s so i could burn her wedding video not one of these dvd s were recognized by my toshiba dvd burner i use velocity dvd rs with no problem go figure 
need warranty repair forget it purchased this tv from walmart on feb st on feb took it to the repair shop for warranty repair was told after days that the part that it needed was no longer available and that they would send me a replacement tv the tv was a model manufactured in was asked to fax my receipt samsung gets my receipt and says that it is to blurred to read have spent hours on hold trying to get to their customer support about the tv i feel that since i have called several times to try to get some answers that samsung is recognizing my name or case number and just ignoring my being on hold yesterday was on hold for an hour and a half with music playing in my ear monday i will fax them an x copy of my receipt that i hope will not be too blurred to read so things are still up in the air was getting the tv for a bedroom and had plans to buy a inch soon no way will i buy it from a samsung dealer with all this calling and waiting my day return policy has passed and i stuck having to make payments on it i had the tv for about days and even though it was my first lcd type tv had to learn about it i could not turn it on or off except with the remote neither did the controls on the side work so i can not give any opinion about picture quality or anything just want them to send my replacement tv so beware of needing any repair while in warranty and if your tv is not working as it should take it back and do it quickly and forget about having any warranty work done like pulling wisdom teeth 
not completly worthless after changing this antenna out several times with the motorola stock antenna on my wifi card the results are this antenna was a complete waste of money and is not as good as the stock antenna that came with the card 
do not order from ritz camera wrong item do not order this item and expect to get what you see i ordered the super high speed card rpsdhgua and what i got was a low quality high speed card rpsdkgua seems to be some kind of a scam that ritz is running with amazon s blessing buyer beware this has happened to me before when you order from one of amazon s partners and amazon will do nothing to help you 
introduces noise you have to use the speck usb cap if you use this skin and it introduces noise to my ipod shuffle which i hate very much it s good protection but you ve got to give up some audio quality for it 
nice while it lasted when i first bought these things they were awesome and really cute i loved the volume control they isolated noise pretty well just not wind but for the price i guess one can t expect much all of a sudden the right ear just stopped working i only had them for about a month and i wish i kept the receipt or the box maybe i could ve had some sort of reimbursement but i ll never know hopefully everyone else has better luck with thos 
does not work with palm easily did not work with my palm t c right away ive not used this for any other purpose i expect either palm or sd to release proper software to have it work with palm t c 
kingston gb sd memory card this sd would not work in my nikon coolpix s camera but the fuji and sandisk product did 
decent when it worked right not sure if i just got a lemon or what but would never purchase this player again it worked right most of the time but found that at times it would confuse the change disc button with the eject button i would have to turn the unit on and off to get it to reset and work correctly it s now about months later and the unit decided it was time to stop working bought it because it was cheap and i guess i got what i paid for fork out the extra cash and purchase another brand 
don t get sucked into this i ve owned mine for months and all of that time has been spent driving around with it in my car trying to get it fixed or exchanged since it hasn t work since day one some dream system the authorized repair center is a total joke as well after being at the repair center for weeks i get a call saying they can not fixed the system and that i need to send it back to sony in texas i get to pay for the boxes packaging material and the shipping yeah and i haven t even watched a movie ye 
appears to work but does not when you need to use it please be very careful when reading reviews of this product i have been using the home edition for months with all the latest patches installed and everything appears to work great it does it backups without any glitches most reviewers are talking about this part of the software a few days ago my windows installed got corrupted after a bios upgrade no worries i thought just restore my backup first the boot up rescue cd did not work i just hangs on a black screen so i reinstalled windows and the acronis software i asked it to restore my latest backup and it said it was good to go it asked if it was ok to format my hard disk and reboot the machine i clicked ok and about minutes later i get a message saying that the archive is corrupted i now lost all data on my hard disk and my backup is completely useless for months it has been doing backups without hinting at any problems but as soon as it formats your hard disk it does realize there is an issue many people have the same issue when i got some of my system installed again i did a test full backup then i did a check archive and it then did tell me that it was corrupted so it can not even backup a few gig and restore it just a few minutes later please do not buy this software it does not work i have spoken to their support department and they told me that the problem was with my machine and that i should take it to the nearest service centre i have windows xp machines with completely different hardware and it is failing on both this is the only software that is having a problem on either machine 
not meant to be plugged in all day netgear is supposed to have a year warranty on the power supply i had one of these for about months over the last months it s been increasingly flaky every week or two it just hangs and needs to be unplugged and started again it doesn t matter how much it s in use its done it when we ve been on vacation with minimal network traffic i called netgear to get it replaced but they told me that it s not meant to be plugged in all day so they won t fix it unless you actually unplug all your network equipement when you are not actively using it i didn t think so then i highly recommend avoiding netgear products 
do not buy until you read this after calling in a computer knowledgable friend to help me install this print server and spending hours trying to install the linksys psus we gave up and called linksys service this unit got two stars for the polite and hard work the service person gave to this situation after one hour with mark at linksys we were told that this psus will not work with any multi function printer linksys gets zero stars for not printing this info on their box installation papers or the enclosed cd linksys knows this will not work on most multi function printers the most common today but will not tell their potential customers save yourself a lot of time and do not do what i did ordered this for a multi funtion printer you owe me a beer for this 
once again terribly disappointed this was sent from nextar as a replacement for a defective macvision mp i ordered for my daughter it took weeks to send in the original they don t return calls in hours as their voicemail states and then it took another weeks for them to get me a replacement which was a step down in price and options from the one it was replacing for about a week this player worked and then it started to do the same things the original did would not play a full song and then goes into a starting loop i would not buy another product from this company 
waste of money bought ! they don t work the batteries do not last we are trying to return them 
make sure you are not buying these for dvds i bought these to make labels for my dvds as when i received them there is a warning on the back that if you use them on dvds they may make the dvd unreadable these are only to be used on cds memorex makes specific labels that are plasic for dvds and do not warp when exposed to the heat of a dvd player stars because the packaging is misleading 
good drive but fragile key ring and bad customer service i purchased this months back and am happy with it for most part didn t have any formatting problems as some of the others but the key hole is fragile and broke off you can probably buy this thing but be extra nice and careful with the cap and be careful if you have memorex rebates they ate away a mail inrebate which was offered with the purchase i called the customer service multiple times and each time they made it harder to get the rebate i ultimately gave up and feel cheated 
if the software is bad it doesnt matter how good the hardware is i am not a techie but i have installed enough hardware of all kinds to know what it involves i am also pretty handy with photoshop and photography this scanner may scan reasonably well but the software kills off its usability there are two pieces of software one to view one to scan with overlapping functions eg resolution and they do not seem to communicate well with each other no problem i changed the settings on both pieces of software i try scanning at maximum resolution and the file size turns out to be about mb for a negative i try lowering the resolution but it wont allow it after countless hours of trying to figure it out i am defeated ill wait for something better to come along 
yet another wireless piece of junk this thing is junk don t waste your money i am a computer professional and i had it working for about minutes then after powering it down and back up it never did work again ! if you buy one go through the setup and if it doesn t work immediately send it right back to amazon ! don t waste your precious time trying to get a brick to do wireless because the odds are that you will just be wasting your time finally amazon likes to keep the good reviews toward the top of the list to keep the potential customer from being discouraged however you should pay more attention to the bad reviews than the good ones if the product is in fact good it won t have many bad reviews or even possibly none at all if it is exceptional however look up all the bad reviews for this product they should tell you that something is seriously wrong with this product 
piece of junk i had to return this boombox as soon as i opened it because the cd player didn t work i got the new one in a few days and it worked for days then stopped it is heavy and cheap and not at all user friendly i have never purchased a product online that was such a huge waste of time and money i realize that it is an inexpensive low end item even so it didn t even meet minimum expectations 
brother m labeling tape inch width this stuff is great my wife and i use it to label things we don t use often so we can tell at a glance what is in a box or what a bottle contains it goes into the labeler without a fuss and works the first time every time the glue on the back once the backing is peeled requires the the surface be dirt and oil free or it will eventually come off the printing will wear off if you are using it in a high friction environment such as on a book in a backpack however it lasts long enough that whatever it is on becomes habit and the label is no longer necessary btw if i did not have fingernails i could not peel the backing off without using a large paperclip there ought to be suggestions from brother about the best way to get the backing started off the label 
overall very poor speakers but subwoofer is very good okay so i just bought the jbl scs speaker system and they are absolutely horrible ! i m sorry to say but the center speaker is ridiculously underpowered barely audible with the other satellite speakers which are also weak and tend to get distorted at higher volumes or with a lot of audio going through them the subwoofer is very good however so i guess the price tag is justified by the subwoofer thats why i gave it stars but the other speakers are pretty much useless just in case anyone wanted to know how these were i d recommend staying away from them and maybe spending slightly more and getting a better system 
save your money ! this system is complete junk how much can i emphasize that i wish we had never purchased this system purchasing a radio from a dollar store would be a better investment this unit is the result of poor manufacturing and will provide you with poor performance i d give it no stars if that were an option we have had our new bose system hooked up for about two months one major complaint is the lack of a headphone jack i have never heard of a stereo system without a headphone jack we were updating all of our components and purchased a new sony dvd recorder vhs and a new directv dvr with tivo we were trying to pair down our equipment turns out none of these components have a headphone jack all of these newer components are being produced without headphone jacks which left us in quite a pickle fortunately we found a company called ramsey electronics which provides a headphone amplifier with audio cables to allow us to hook our headphones through the ramsey unit and then into the bose unit it set us back next we had the dilemma with the remote the tivo remote won t work with bose though it did work with my year old pioneer sound system then i spent another on a decent learning remote that could control all of my components but i d rather use the tivo remote as irritating as that was the most irritating thing about the bose unit is that the audio video plugs do not stay plugged in they are all kind of loose we bought new expensive a v cables thinking that would solve the problem we ve tried everything to remedy this problem including pushing the unit up against the back wall of our entertainment center in order to keep the plugs from falling out i can t tell you how disheartening it is to be in the middle of a movie with a bose sound system and just have the sound go out because one of the plugs fell out of its socket it s not a tension issue either it s poor manufacturing even more flawed is the dvd disc tray first there is no eject button on the remote then when you press the eject button on the unit it will just say opening nothing happens ! then when you press it again it just says closing nothing happens my husband had to teach me that if you push the eject button in rapid succession you can sometimes get it to open that s just swell for a investment i have a dvd player in the guest room that i paid for and it opens and closes its disc tray no problem go figure fortunately for us we have the sony dvd recorder player and use it when the bose is being temperamental we ve only been able to successfully watch dvds using the bose because the tray won t open also it sounds nothing like it does in the store i don t know if they have some special demo disc or what but our year old pioneer system had far superior sound we ve never owned a bose unit before and thought we were stepping up to purchase this one i think we stepped way down also how can a company that manufactures headphones not make any units with a headphone jack that makes no sense at all to inform me in the literature that i will lose sound quality by plugging my bose headphones into a nonbose component must be some sort of joke the bose units don t have a headphone jack what else am i supposed to plug them into i am confused about this i ve always been told that bose is the leader in sound components but this headphone issue is just a lack of good common sense and the shotty manufacturing of the plugs and disc tray have caused me an enormous amount of stress and regret save yourself money time regret and stress by finding a different system this one will only test your sanity in regards to the you spent on this piece of junk 
shipping packaging needs improvement i recently ordered two of these antennas and have not yet had the opportunity to set them up on my cb radios for a test run however i did want to comment about the packaging for the products which i purchased from amazon com the antennas arrived inside their original mgf display packs which had been placed inside a narrow rectangular cardboard box with a strip of plastic air bags on either side for packing material however this did not prevent the cardboard box from collapsing bending during shipping which in turn bent the stainless steel antennas inside their packaging about degrees i have spent the last couple of hours trying to straighten the antennas the stainless steel material is not easy to straighten by hand and i still am not done working with one of the antennas it would have been nice if the packaging had been better andor the boxes marked as fragile so this would not have happened i am confident that these units will preform very well but am not happy with the shipping thus the star rating 
good when it works i bought this item not to cool my laptop but to provide some insulation from the heat when it s on my lap sitting in a chair i m very satisfied with it s being able to accomplish that however the cord ended up breaking after a few months targus replaced it at no charge which is good but still a hassle now one of the two fans has started making a racket when i first turn it on after a bit it settles down but very noisy at first 
needs to go to rehab for its ink drinking problem this printer sucks ! it started out working wonderfully then all of a sudden after the third month in use it started printing very slowly then it decided it wouldn t print at all unless i completely shut down my computer everytime something is wrong when you can only get sheets of paper out of text only documents from the black ink cartridge it also uses the color ink when it s not requested i only needed the color ink a couple of times not for pictures and it went just as fast as the black i used to love hp they are now making garbage i m thinking of looking at the oki brand don t waste your money on this one 
it went dark after months i bought this monitor in april for six months it was great then it stopped working it s under warranty so i am hoping to get it fixed at apple s expense but i ask you what kind of quality control does apple use and what can i expect after the warranty runs out next april i am deeply disappointed i have been using apple computers for years this was the first time i bought an apple monitor it is also the last time 
not up to belkin s usual quality i have used several belkin kvm products omniport and omniport se and was very happy with those units over many years when i wanted a kvm to use with my new dvi video i thought this would be a good choice sadly it is close to a disaster on three levels setup ergonomicssetting up the unit was hard because my dell dvi video cable housing just barely fit into the input connector on the belkin base unit the belkin cables are quite nice but have the smallest footprint of any cables i ve seen and many cables that come with comuters or lcd displays will have a hard time fitting this unit the compact neature of the kvm means that connections are hard to see if you do not have a very well lit area reliabilitynext the unit worked for one week and died my first call to tech support was offensive as the belkin rep wanted me to replace my usb keyboard to be sure that was not my problem since i did not have one i could not get any return authorization i did finally borrow a keyboard the next day but when calling belkin again the tech did not have me test the keyboard at all his debugging was simple and in minutes he verified that i had a defective kvm i got a new unit quickly and returned the old one but see more on this below that unit worked for days and then began to malfunction so far i have been able to restore it but this is only possible by powering down all the peripherals unplugging all the cables into the kvm powering down the kvm and reversing the process customer service to get your rma for defective equipment you have to provide belkin with a charge card that they say they will only use if you fail to return the defective unit i was careful enough to have my unit shipped with delivery confirmation because belkin charged my account for a tidy way more than the amazon price when i called customer service i was told they had no record of receiving my return but when i gave them the tracking number of my shipment the rep immediately said ok that is all the documentation that we need i will credit your account she was so matter of fact that i believe this is a common occurence summarysome belkin products are great this in not one of them belkin service is inconsistent and this issue on returns is one that makes me plan on avoiding belkin electronic components i am going to look at the iogear kvm sold by amazon as a possible alternative 
expensive rabbit ears this is no better than the old fashion rabbit ears the powered portion of this antenna does nothing to boost the signal i found this item to be almost useless since it does not pick up any analog signals very well at all as for the digital signals you will have to adjust the antenna whenever you change the channel if you spent your hard earned money on a hdtv why are you going to buy a junkie antenna 
piece of junk not durable in the least even for an adult i purchased this for my year old son for christmas luckily i took it out and inspected it while he wasn t home i took it to my piano and was going to tune it when i noticed that tuning it made the neck start coming away from the main part after twisting the middle string x it broke first act includes extra strings for the two thinnest strings but not for the middle i am very disappointed and will be sending it back i m just glad i looked at it before christmas morning 
there are better choices available my unit failed after one day of use never even got to the field plugged it in to charge it overnight and next day only the blue led would come on but could no longer connect bluetooth connections can be tricky and the paper manual provided is worthless the on cd manual better but is still way too spartan for a device like this i liked the standard mini usb cable connection for the charger similar feature on my razr but i found it vexing that you couldn t use that same cable for data it appears to be a standard cable but instead have to buy a special cable for using the data port they give you the mobile and ac charger but the omission of a data cable seems odd other units using bluetooth and usb such as the in by wintec provide this i found a lot of complaints and kudos for this unit surfing for solutions to my issues so it appears that their are some quality control problems in the manufacturing folks with working units seem to love them if you get one with the bad solder connections you are disappointed 
telezapper worked great for about a week then i seemed to get an average of telemarketing calls a da 
hypersensitive and bascially doesn t work i bought this dvd player for the multi region capabilities but i now have a much bigger problem i can t watch any of my dvds this player seems to be extremely sensitive to the slightest scratch or smudge and it really does not like discs i ve burned myself every time i use it there s a chance it won t load the disc at all i have to wait about minutes to find out if it does load it will likely stop several times and probably never start up again very frustrating ! don t know what is wrong with this thing but i ve tried dozens of discs with the same result i ll be looking for something else this thing just does not work 
adorable decorations but they sound awful these are irresistably cute but they sound terribly tinny and they are unbearable for more than five minutes i regret giving them to someone i love as a gift they are now sitting on his desk as a decoration and he s still using his old speakers i know you might not be able to stop yourself from buying these don t expect a pleasant listening experience from these speakers 
i bought the marware protection pack to prevent it from getting dirty this is one of the most frustrating things that has happened to me so i bought my macbook a week ago and to go a long with it i bought the marware protection pack the purpose i bought the cover for was to protect my notebook however the hand rest cover has ruined my notebook there is a sticky residue that is left behind when i peeled back the hand rest today it is all over the hand rest portion of my laptop keep in mind that it has been a week i am irritated and upset that marware has sold me such a negligible product 
dont be fooled by the name motorola i have had this phone for months and it works but the battery life is not good the phones are now to the point that the battery life is very short i expected much more with a product made by motorola i tossed my sony wireless for this one and wish i had not 
ear piercing the drive has great capacity and works fast enough however after seeking it makes a very high pitched noise it is not even that loud and yet i can t stand it at all would not recommend based on this if you have any kind of sensitive hearing additionally the drive has no means to set it to run slower but with less noise unlike other drives 
i returned it voice echoed back to me cheap casing that i would expect in a phone i returned it after day very disappointed and way to expensive for what it is the good news was that amazon refunded my purchase price 
did not perform as advertised this unit failed to provide reliable power to my new toshiba satellite a laptop it cycled on and off every seconds it powered a watt lamp okay but wouldn t start a watt heat lamp at all product spec sheet says it can supply watt surge and watts for min and is rated at watts continuous my laptop power supply is rated at a input at vac and if it drew a constantly i agree that it would need to watts which exceeds the continuous rating of this inverter however even at that power demand the inverter should run it for min but only manages sec in addition i doubt that the laptop power supply actually draws a full amps continuously i talked to linksys support and they suggested returning the unit for replacement or refund so i did it did not work for me maybe it would work for a laptop that only needs watts but i wouldn t recommend it for more than that 
low price low quality no technical support this transcend gb x has not failed yet but the transcend gb x cf card that i purchased a month earlier failed and i lost some very important images i was using it in my canon d i tried several different software recovery programs to retreive the images and none of them worked i have tried to contact transcend technical support through their website but they failed to respond i do not recommend transcend cf cards this experience has taught me to pay a little more and stick with the proven brands sandisk lexar and kingston 
may be nice features but i m a tech who recently tried to help install configure the wifi printer server card which later turned out to be faulty installing this printer card properly can become a nightmare ! it took over two hrs with helpful but slow online live help hp support to finally figure out the card was bad there are also possible firmware upgrade issues on this wifi device to be aware of setting up the different profiles for this rig is not for the novice

overpriced as for digital technology monster cable has once again ruined the marketplace by greatly over estimating what their products are worth the great difference with the digital output inpt devices compared to analog is simple if the digital signal reaches the device it needs to it can t be any more or less clear because your digital signal is comprised of s and s if you can see your tv or hear the music then what ever cable you use works there is no distortation across digital signals so don t pay the extra money in fact you shouldn t need to spend more than around 
uniden dct expanded cordless system with digital answering system and call waiting caller id phones had buzzing interferance upon pickup calling party was not there all the time volume always varied either too loud or you could not hear caller 
waste of money i bought this as a backup drive several months ago for my home business after the iomega backup drive i was using crashed and took my backup with it the maxtor software installs automatically when you plug in the drive so that part was really easy and it took just a few minutes the initial backup was really easy and went pretty fast too so far so good the problem is that once the initial backup takes place the backup function doesn t backup new or updated files the scheduled backup doesn t work at all the light flashes so you think it s working but it doesn t backup any new or updated files the synch is useless too it s like the backup function it will synch your files one time but then after that it doesn t synch any of your new or updated files like it s supposed to it s like it takes a snapshot of your computer at a specific time and that s it to get around the fact that it won t automatically back up my files i have to manually transfer my files every few days or so which is a real pain as i have to remember what files have been updated and or are new i would not buy this product again it s not an automatic backup drive it s just an external drive that will back up one time but then isn t reliable at all if you need a backup drive look elsewhere sorry to say this one is a complete waste of money 
xp users beware i recently bought this thinking i could use it to upgrade my ti calculator to my surprise i heard it was incompatible with xp i supposed the worst that could happen is that it wouldn t work as soon as i recieved the cable it said to go to the website so i went and updated the software specific to my calculator after the installation it asked me to restart after the restart i immediatly recieved a blue screen of death and luckily windows xp found out it corrupted a file in the registry and fixed it but were it not for that i would have to do a format i have not fully installed it yet as now i have started backing up everything as a just in case scenerio however i warn users that when buying this product be cautious as this is not xp compatible and may mess up your system 
db i doubt it despite careful aiming this has exactly and i mean exactly the same signal strength as my cheapie airlink db omni and is weaker than my homemade pirouline cantenna probably not a bad antenna if you can pick it up cheap but save your money if you re expecting db performance 
direct turntable connection too weak i attempted to use this cable with the griffin imic to connect my turntable directly to my g imac and import some of my old vinyl lps however this setup was not able to produce anything close to satisfactory recordings despite tweaking the settings in the finyl vinyl software provided with the imic and the mac s sound control panel the recorded signal was very weak even with input gains maxed out and even worse there was an intolerable amount of white noise sound like rushing air in the recording the signal coming out of the turntable is simply way too weak to provide a decent signal for recording without a preamplifer in the setup i connected the turntable to my old stereo receiver and plugged the imic into one of the receiver s tape recorder outputs and voila lots of signal strength and very clean recordings no white noise whatsover direct connection of the turntable to the computer would have been more convenient but the results are not satisfactory to even a casual listener such as myself i m bucks poorer but wiser for the experience 
a toy piano has better sound than this for the price i expected much better sound should spend a little more and get a shoenhut or for you could get a toy piano that sounds better than this one very tinny sound completely out of tune why do they bother even assigning a note to the keys and lid is attached with screws and glue so the only way to get to the metal rods to attempt to tune it even after the screws are removed will be to crack the wood casing getting past the glue 
broken in weeks i got these to replace my yellow sony sports headphones the yellow ones were kind of rubbery and i ve had them for years these broke within weeks and not under great stress or high use either just simply taking them off of my head by pulling them apart to get them out of my ear and they broke where the length of the left ear adjusts very poor design and cheap plastic i ll buy other sony headphones especially if i can find ones made similar to my older yellow ones but i will never buy another set of these plus they sound greatcon they are such poor design that they broke at a really thin place of construction that would get a lot of pressure from anyone when putting them on or taking them off their head 
do not buy from amazon com better cards are available from other retailers just check epinions com you will find a whole bunch for or less also they deliver while amazon does not the item has label usually ships in hours but i have waited five days and still it was not shipped do not buy this card and check other place than amazon the amazon stinks 
not a lot of a value for the money too many disadvantages no battery backup even on the brightest setting the clock are barely visible from the distance you d be expecting better sound from this unit it s acceptable with the radio but cd sound quality is extremely poor etc 
yes beware do not order this item if you want a dvd player with a inch screen this item is not as pictured you will receive a small orange colored player with a inch screen 
does not deserve the name i have owned and programmed many sandisk cruzer micro drives and they work wonderfully with that experience in mind i ordered gb cruzer mini s for a customer first impression is that they are much lighter than the micro when i plugged them in they operated fine but the real test of a usb flash drive is during installation and use of flash drive based applications i absolutely adores portableapps suite because it s a menu based system that contains an incredible wealth of free open source applications inside a menu based system on cheap generic drives installation does not work sad to say the same is true of the mini as stated my sandisk micro works like a champ and i ve dealt with many of them but none of the sandisk mini s work with this menu application system truly the sign of a cheap drive fortunately the seller where i bought these also is having problems and has agreed to take them back i got lucky but sandisk should be ashamed to tarnish their otherwise good name with this incredibly bad product 
waste of time program would not work updater would not work tech support was not available because of overload 
was hoping for something a little more durable loved the idea of being able to clip the ipod mount to the dash vents unfortunately the execution of this concept was lacking in this product the clips held to the vents but they fell off the back of the mount we have gone with plan b and used the self adhesive mount directly on the dash sticks well but can t see the ipod once it is in the mount well at least we can keep out eyes on the road with one less distraction 
so close and yet so far sure this calculator does lots of really neat stuff it would be impossible to give a rating based on the features either it does what you need it to do or it doesn t like any other tool however i can rate subjectively and this thing is subjecting my head to a royal headache the lcd viewing angle has been designed so that you only get good contrast when viewing it at a very weird angle exactly the wrong angle if you are in a room with overhead lighting or brightly colored walls in order to get good contrast you must be looking at the lcd screen at such an angle as to make the lcd screen and the curvy faceplate reflect overhead lights the ceiling the walls etc if you attempt to view the lcd screen head on in an attempt to reduce these inevitable reflected light sources and so that the characters on the screen are not stretched due to exaggerated perspective or so that the buttons actually face your torso so they can be easily pushed god forbid the characters appear extremely dim that is the contrast is set all wrong and i haven t found any way to fix it a technology that was mature for hand helds in the s now if there is a way to fix the lcd contrast and i m just ignorant about it i ll gladly take the egg on the face to fix it and get rid of my headache but i doubt it then there s the hard cover like so many other calculators these days it comes with a nasty hard plastic cover that increases the thickness by and also increases the width a bit and of course to go without the hard cover leaves you with nothing at all for protection the soft cover some other calculators come with is thinner lighter and takes less plastic to construct but as we see all too often in thousands of other made inchina products the more plastic you can get the consumer to buy and carry around the betteror something so just like most calculators the hard plastic cover works but sucks and should be a separately purchasable option and this perverted lcd viewing angle is almost prohibitively uncomfortable and the inability to adjust is beyond asinine these are such easy things to fix it s ridiculous that sharp would put so much excellent functionality into such a miss themark package where s qa on this made in china 
frustrating on the surface this is a slick mouse it s cute small full featured and stowing the receiver in the mouse is great but after using this for a week and a half i m ready to throw it out lets see it refuses to turn back on after being stored i ll pull it out of my laptop bag plug in the receiver and no juice the mouse doesn t turn on even though it s automatically supposed to turn after you unstow the receiver i have to open the mouse up and reseat the batteries sometimes when i plug the receiver into my laptop it doesn t get recognized i try multiple ports and nothing once i reboot it s ok the absolutel last straw as of last night the mouse motion will suddenly freeze you ll be mousing around and the mouse will suddenly lock up the buttons will click the mousewheel will still scroll the page but the cursor will be frozen it only becomes unstuck when you scroll the wheel it s absolutely aggravating to be working on my design work only to get stuck mid movement scroll the wheel move the mouse figure out where my cursor has now gone it places it randomly and then go back to work only to repeat the process all over again seconds later im really disappointed i ve bought a few other wenger products and never had a problem i honestly didn t think twice when i was looking for a wireless mobile optical and saw this one with the wenger logo it s actually more expensive than the one i was originally looking at but i thought hey it s a wenger ill be thinking twice from now on piece of crap 
excellent product one of the reviewers graded this product way down based on cost of shipping good warning for other buyers but not entirely fair to the product itself i bought this screen protector based on other product reviews and i m glad i did the palm t x screen appears to be a bit fragile at least that s how it seems to me the cleartouch crystal screen protector retains the sensitivity as far as i can tell so far but appears to provide a much more resistant writing tapping surface from the product descriptions i wondered if it would be tricky to install it s not goes on like a charm do clean the original screen carefully first and use compressed gas duster to get the last dust particles off otherwise a breeze to install 
no shuffle between disks i will be returning my cd changer while keeping the wave music system the reason is that it does not have the capability to shuffle between disks i e it will randomly play songs within one disk and then move to the next disk it cannot play a song on one disk and then randomly switch to another disk btw the reason these systems are expensive is that they are made in the usa a great reason to buy bose 
inadequently represented this product did arrive in good condition for that i will award two stars this product represents little information of what it does i believe it only works with dvi signals having tv outwith my component television the display has inaccurate colors white is purple no resolution setting from x x on many different hz frequences solved the problem this product is not intended for a normal video card as in my macbook pro which works great by the way 
extremely disappointed this is all looks and no sound quality at all bass is terrible i wouldn t waste my money on this again i listen to hard rock mostly and the bass just sounds muddy and distorted i have connected it to my ipod and stereo and the results are similar don t waste your money on this i did like the bag that came with it though i guess you get what you pay for 
poor not nearly as good as the earphones that come with the ipod i listen to lots of classical music and wanted some quality earphones for my new ipod in the range the shure e gets top reviews mine were a big disappointment i thought my first pair was defective and shure generously exchanged them the replacement pair was just a bad the e series has very poor base and very harsh higher frequencies overall these earphones are much worse than the original earphones that come with the ipod much worse the sound produced by the e is marginally better than a cell phone if you re not serious about music and want something fancy to plug your ears with the shure earphones will do the job 
great picture quality when it works my wife and i got this tv for christmas the picture quality is awesome we initially thought the built in tuner was great too we could receive time warner high def channels with no problem now after weeks the tuner has died at first it was taking a couple minutes to warm up before displaying the picture now it just displays static called sony and they say it needs a new tuner luckily i bought it from best buy so i can just return it to the store 
consumer reports best buy error bought one of these phones like everyone else followed all instructions exactly after less than year battery won t hold charge and phone keys have to be pressed numerous times to dial just bought brand new battery and followed charging recommendations before attempting use it doesn t work headed for the garbage don t buy this and waste your money 
if i could give it zero stars i would you get what you pay for in this case junk it lasted all of days and one use the wires fell out of the usb connection unfortunately for me it was while i was driving down the road on a hour trip and within the first min after leaving the house i suggest buying something a bit more expensive that will last more than a couple days very poorly constructed connections 
i should have believed the other reviewers even after reading the bad reviews this product received from other reviewers i still purchased it it is pretty easy to set up but once connected to my pc it had very inconsistent behavior the device would lose connection to the server after a being idle for hours and require a reset the video performance was awful with the included software tversity freeware media server made video performance better but fast forward and rewind wouldn t work do to some video conversion routines being run by tversity music files would play and sounded good but navigating through my music selection was nearly impossible because the music search feature doesn t work really doesn t work at all i upgraded firmware and played all sorts of games to try and get the device to work finally i gave up and shipped it back to amazon the thing was just more trouble than it was worth fyi amazon returns were great 
waste of money i too wish i could give a star rating this product is worthless we get almost no radio stations to come in and the cd player only worked for about a month a complete waste of money 
broke very easily the extendable arm breaks very easily i had two of them and they both broke within the first month the company does have a month warranty but you have to pay for shipping to send it back to them and i have been waiting over a month for my replacement very poor product do not buy 
overpriced under featured misleading o k so i m paying for a set top box with a gb hard drive but i can t use it as a dvr why not also the only content i can play on this set top box is content that comes through itunes that s right if it isn t in your itunes library you can play it on the apple tv this means you caqn play your dvd s you cant t play saved dvd imovie or other movie files you can t play anything unless it has been successfully y added to your itunes library also make sure you see the fine print about having to have a widescreen tv they aren t joking about this if you don t have one you can still use this item but it will show up as a frame about half the size of your screen it won t go to the edges and be borderless so you have a tiny window to view inside a large black box any pros it has to be the easiest setup i have ever experienced with an electronic item i mean less than minutes and i was set also i thought it was really coll that with zero configuring on my part it was able to communicate perfectly with itunes just because i plugged the apple tv into my airport extreme router that my computer was also plugged into basically apple tv saw this is a direct link i didn t think it would be that easy without having to configure something but it was also the menus are very helpful and attractive this will be a good product down the line when this will have a larger hard drive and dvr capability right now it s time to sell this one on ebay and wait a few years for something better if this had only cost me or i would probably keep it however is too much for too little 
complete ripoff the very idea that this cheap piece of plastic could ever warrant a list price of us makes my stomach hurt this is a knockoff computer component like buying a rolex on the streets of new york for and shouldn t cost more than that a price that factors in a cut for retailers and distributors as well the bootlegers that make those fake rolexes probably own the factories that make junk like this i got one for dollars on ibiao dot com with free shipping and surprise surprise it did not work and yes it was the exact same as the one in the photo above a real one can be found for not too much more money and will work far better 
beware samsung dlp design flaws consumers should be aware of serious design flaws which exist in samsung dlp televisions cooling fans and color wheels are highly susceptible to failing as a non techniocal person i should have no idea what these parts are but alas i bought a samsung dlp expect these to fail within years expect to pay approx to replace the color wheel and to replace the colling fan that is if your service technician can find them in stock anywhere these parts are commonly in a national backorder because of the very high failure rates you should also expect the lamp to fail sooner than advertized many people need to purchase a new lamp between years and some more often than that the lamp costs approx depending on your model but you should be able to replace it yourself without too much difficulty this cost will be in addition to replacement costs for the color wheel and colling fan please remember that these maintenance costs are recurring and you will have to fix them again in another years while i was very satisfied with the quality and performance of my dlp my color wheel failed very early i called tech support to report a grinding noise and was told to turn it off wait minutes and turn it back on like this would fix the problem after doing this for a while the color wheel finally failed actually shattered ! now i am out of warranty and samsung wants nothing to do with me i have even tried ordering the part myself from two different online vendors and they are both backordered indefinitely ! it has been weeks and they have no estimate for when this part will be available samsung cannot even give me an estimate when the supply of replacement parts is expected to meet demand i have had my tv for months and apparently there is a national epidemic of them breaking at the same time i have a samsung plasma which is a beautiful set along with a crt both are wonderful products but samsung is selling dlp lemons and will not stand behind them dlp is a great bargain up front but a maintenance nightmare ! you will pay in the long run and by the long run i mean every years if you still want to purchase a dlp television please buy the extended warranty ! it will save you a ton but you will still have to wait for the circuit city tech to find parts which may take months i expect samsung to abandon their design flaw riddled dlp sector and focus on their beautiful plasma line expect dlp prices to drop even further but please look before you leap 
these dvd rs suck i used a pack of these doing dvd backups and the last or so failed i thought it was my software so i got new software guess what my first disc out of the new package of that i bought failed too it s not my burner as another reviewer suggested implying that people should learn to read as it s brand new and doesn t require the firmware upgrade they mention they just suck and have a high failure rate so the consensus seems to be that tdk or sony are best i m buying some now and save myself the frustration 
nice feel but short life looks and feels nice but when dropped on concrete or ceramic floors ir will snap both broke the same way within a few weeks i m looking for the original all plastic stylus 
customer service nightmare product came doa software wouldn t load called technical support who times said they would email the download but their english wasn t good enough to get my email address correct even after spelling several times called kensington corporate in california and spoke to customer service manager who said someone would call me shortly called customer service manager back hours later and he noted it wasn t his fault no one contacted me as he passed on the information im returning this after investing hours unsuccessfully trying to overcome the kensington customer service prevention department 
charger stopped charging i was impressed with the charger for about month than it stopped charging the nimh batteries it came with i took it back to best buy only to find that all of the rapid chargers on thier shelf did not work either a sales person and i tested them all hoping i would be able to exchange my broken one with one that worked it was more disappointing after calling kodak they were unable to replace it or get my money back i thought purchasing a kodak was a smart decision however they did not stand behind their product which was very disappointing 
impossible to use without additional accessories comes with lousy instructions and is not complete as far as i can tell 
re absolutely terrible to celebrate the anniversary of our company we thought we d give all employees a gift our apple phobic it guys nixed the ipod as a choice despite the ceo and cto both owning and recommending them so we went with the zune of the we bought had to be exchanged for quality issues we ve had issues with the drivers on the vista enabled computers and spotty syncing with the xp machines several of the units have had poor performing batteries and several also had a buzz in the headphones we can t use them as data drives so they re not as useful as we d like finally store interoperability is zero and we cannot understand why drm is applied to files if you share them which reminds me the wireless is half baked too slow and we ve had plenty of hang ups while trying to share the end of the story is that the ceo is both pissed and embarrassed as to the gift debacle he has already said in no uncertain terms that when apple ships a video ipod the company will give those to make up for the zune experience 
cheaper at walmart recently discovered you can get the same cartrige at walmart for not worth the price here especially after you have to pay for shipping go to walmart 
una basura this mic is a piece of trash i bougth it and you have to shout to be listened es una completa basura y una perdida de recursos 
tried two units both defective the first unit i received produced a picture but no sound over the rf connection so i sent it back for a replacement unit that one produced no picture or sound worthless ! i ll be trying a different brand note that i double checked all cables and connections to verify that everything else was working properly 
linux users beware i purchased this card after borrowing a card with an identical product number from a friend my friend s card worked out of the box with my version of ubuntu linux when i received my card it simply did not work after doing some research i found that i had a card with a different version number and a different chipset my friend s card had a chipset made by atheros which worked out of the box the card that i purchased had a broadcom chipset which is notorious for being incompatible with linux even after going to the forums i was unable to make the card work belkin is dishonest in that it makes changes to the chipset without changing the product number only the version number which the consumer is not made aware of had i been aware that the card had a different chipset i would not have ordered it 
mediocre sound quality questionable reliability weak radio reception i bought this stereo because of its relatively small size and stylish appearance and because it had aux inputs for me to hook up my mp player to it the first unit i received would not turn on at all i contacted philips tech support and their solution was for me to send the brand new defective stereo back to them at my expense fortunately amazon has a very nice return policy and i sent it back to them instead amazon was also very nice in sending a replacement right away without waiting until they received the defective unit the replacement stereo arrived in short order and i was immediately disappointed in the sound quality which didn t seem as good as the year old cassette player boombox that i was replacing after listening to the stereo for a few days and comparing it to a sony cmt ne bookshelf stereo that i own here are my thoughts the fm reception is not as good as the cmt ne both units have a thin wire type of antenna and both wires are about the same length the philips stereo however would hiss and crackle as i moved around the room my body interfered with the reception this did not happen with the sony stereo the sound quality is not as good as the cmt ne playing the same song side byside on the two stereos i found that the philips stereo had a flat tinny sound when compared to the cmt ne the sony system had a much fuller and richer sound quality also there seemed to be significant distortion in the high frequencies on the philips stereo making s sounds sound more like h sounds i also noticed an occasional crackle of distortion in the overall sound possibly due to a bad connector on the aux input the ergonomics of the philips stereo are not so good for one thing the stereo will easily tip over forwards if accidentally bumped if that happens the cd can get wedged in the cd tray and it becomes almost impossible to remove the electronically actuated cd door is much more likely to break than a passive mechanical door like the top loading cmt ne the volume goes up to or so but is about as loud as you would need it for regular listening this means that there are only quieter volume levels which is rather limiting finally the stereo is a bit bigger than i was expecting though i could have looked more closely at the specs when buying it i am in the process of returning this stereo and i will try to find a sony system instead unfortunately amazon no longer sells the cmt ne which i bought just about a year ago i don t understand why electronics manufacturers feel the need to churn their product lines so rapidly is there really that much innovation in bookshelf stereos the only difference between the sony i bought last year and one i bought in is the ability to play mp cds 
poor quality and poor service my wife purchased this cordless phone set for me as a christams present since putting it in operation over two months ago i have had nothing that comes close to quality phone service none of the three handset will operate ten feet beyond the base station all the handsets have static and a constant buzzing sound regardless of where they are relative to the base station i followed every point in the owner s manual regarding trouble shooting with no success my calls to uniden customer service took more than minutes to reach a representative the end result was that the last of the customer service representative i spoke with told me that the uniden phone i was using was a high quality product but that the frequency just doesn t work in your environment i live well out in the country and know of nothing that would interfer with cordless phone operation within miles of my house moreover a radio shack cordless phone that i purchased five years ago works perfectly throughout my house i am out the purchase price but uniden has lost a customer 
horrible product i bought this product for my tivo and it broke within a few weeks as other reviewers have said the rj connector is incredibly fragile and it s really not a question of if it will break but when i recommend the netgear fa instead instead of a flimsy flip up you plug the cat directly into a sturdy box and it puts less pressure on the tivo s usb port how a big company like linksys with all it s money and brainpower delivers such an obviously inferior product is beyond me 
note type m and h xd cards are incompatible with some card readers note type m and h xd cards are incompatible with some card readers i have a fuji camera and bought an xd card type m but it turns out that type m and type h cards are not compatible with all card readers even ones that work with regular xd cards so i have to use my cable and camera batteries to upload photos from my new card or purchase a new card reader ugh buyer beware 
mine broke quickly ! software is terrible i agree with all the other feedback saying this product is faulty the on off button is terrible it takes tries to turn the unit off after months of using this the unit would no longer talk with the satellites i sent it back to delorme it tested bad now i have waited weeks for a replacement that is backordered customer service rep will not refund your purchase after days ! the software claims it will compute driving routes for you but it will crash your pda instead i had to buy inav iguidance software which is outstanding to get software that will actually compute road routes for me i would not recommend this product to anyone it has been a complete waste of money for me 
cable is so thin i cut it in seconds with some cheap pliers anybody with a cheap pair of cutting pliers will be able to cut through the cable in seconds i know because i just did it the cable is very thin and is made of pliable steel wire you could even use household scissors to gnaw through having this lock on is better than nothing because the thief needs to have some cutting tool and then has to deal with the remaining lock that is attached to your computer however if you are going to go through the trouble of locking up your computer you might as well get something with a stronger cable 
it s a small thing but why not sell the thing with a battery it s a special battery not available in the boonies so i have a choice drive miles or wait another week for a battery to come in the mail iknow iknow in the text it does say battery not included but who reads that so for the folks who read this buy a battery too 
could not get this remote to work i bought this remote to use with my ipod g with clickwheel and despite installing as instructed i could not get this to operate it fit the ipod very well so i figured i would not have a problem i have also used maxell products in the past and also haven t had any problems the remote lit up but it would not operate any of the functions when i pointed it at my ipod maybe this is a great product and i did something wrong but it is easy to install and mine would not work i returned the remote to amazon as defective and received a refund for it again this might be a great product but i wanted to write a review to warn other customers that i had problems with it 
for casual use most advanced functions do not work basic connectivity and wireless work any attempt to use advanced firewall rules fail including vpn passthrough this device could not have gone through even a rudamentory test cycle please read the reviews this is common and these problem were confirmed by my it dept and also by d links tech s as well on second one all of the exact same problems sad to have made a choice hope they make it right 
works overall i don t like it when the screen is black between scenes and what not their is a lot of mixed in red and other colors from interference buy a different one this one is just not up to the task 
where s the fricken battery crooks as with other reviewers i did not receive the battery that was supposed to be included with the case in fact i didn t even receive the case that was pictured the case i did receive was the case i had originally planned to buy so it s a keeper i am assuming that the batteries are being removed from these cases and sold seperately to increase profits buyer beware 
slide negative scanning is poor i ve got quite a bit of experience with scanners and was very happy with my slim canon but i wanted to scan negatives so i picked up this item on a whim thinking i could trust hp to make a decent scanner that s the last time i ll make that assumption i am using it with my ibook i downloaded the most recent software from hps website which i recommend since the software that ships with it is terrible i am primarily interested in the negative scanning feature i am disappointed the scanner is slow slow slow slow takes forever to warm up and scan when it finally scans the images end up either underexposed or overexposed but never correctly exposed i ll have the print in front of me and it looks nothing like the version of the photo the scanner generated from the negative i have tried tweaking various options but to no avail besides you shouldn t have to tweak a lot of options to get a decent exposure out of a negative that you know is correctly exposed the mac software is somewhat bloated and poorly designed there are eleven different applications installed where only one is required iphoto already does everything of people need to do and comes pre installed on every mac why is hp trying to replace iphoto to make their product easy to use they should do one thing scan let iphoto take care of the rest i just tried to scan a photo while composing this post and am sorry to report that the software is non responsive and won t launch either by double clicking the application or by pressing the buttons on the front of the scanner what a fiasco i am going to try to install the scanner on my pc and see if the results are any better but i am not optimistic especially given the other reviews of this product so i am disappointed and am now considering spending considerably more money on a true film scanner bottom line avoid 
does not work on intel macs the ishock ii will not work on intel macs and per macally website they have no intention of releasing an intel compatible driver for the ishock ii don t waste your time on his product like i did 
look at all the pretty bubbles not simply put the keyboard sticky scuff cover never flattens out completely there are always bubbles if you like playing with them all the time then this product is for you the keyboard soft material cover is not so bad but holds onto the dirt and oils that would normally get on your screen and keyboard so when you close the lid the material then transfers some of that dirt right back my resolve just wipe your keyboard and screen with a soft clean semi wet towel every so often and the macbook pro will keep its luster 
no good for students i am a student in a technology high school and when i saw that this bag would fit my laptop and what looked like room for my books i was in for a shock initially it was fine but after a month or so of use a small hole began to form which recently formed into a large hole now the whole handle part of the bag is coming off it is a good bag but it is poorly designed for any student in my opinion who needs to carry both a laptop and a large number of text books 
happy i got it off unimpressive glad i didn t pay the full list pric 
very fragile f pin connectors beware the f pin connectors are very fragile even a small amount of tug applied to the connectors will pull it right off the cable for the amount of money i spent on the monster video cable they should have been stronger i picked a cheap length of cable at my local hardware store and the connectors were virtually indestructable monster cable should manufacture a more robust product 
too bulky low battery life poor quality i bought this phone to replace a ge phone it s a lot bulkier and heavier with a much lower battery life the sound quality is ok if i m in the same room with the base but has a constant record skipping sound when i leave the room with it i bought this phone because it was just a few dollars more than a new battery for my old phone i wish i d just bought the new battery instead 
wrong speakers sent to me i received the wrong speakers i ordered the penguin speakers and got the monkey speakers they were a christmas gift for my niece who collects penguins i e mailed the company several times with no response back so i will never order from this company again will take my business elsewhere 
don t buy these blank discs are defective i was never able to record any pictures or audio data to them the maxell blank discs that i have did the job fine 
sandisk sddr mobilemate good luck the reader didn t read my g minisd i have another reader that does so i dumped the mobilemate and took the lost 
lousy design i m displeased egad ! upon receiving this remote control i found that it requires four aaa batteries there was no mention of that requirement in the product description ! i concur with the other review writer the control is top heavy and i would add poorly designed it s thick at the top and thin at the bottom making it unwieldy i will be returning this monstrosity 
computer brain blew it computer brain sent the wrong product right before xmas so the present that i intended had to be shipped back and it is jan and i am still awaiting the right one so i don t even know what the product is actually like yet 
not worth it the photo is decrptive the photo makes it look wider than it is as no dimensions are listed i was fooled by the photo it s only about wide the screws putting it together are difficult to screw in straight due to poorly constructed parts you d do as well putting an old book or two under your monitor which is what i do with worthless old computer books like books on windows 
won t work with philips jackrabbit cd rewriter i tried using these cd s with the philips jackrabbit cd rewriter and they don t work 
never worked in n draft mode it took a few hours to learn how to download the latest firm ware for the router and n draft adapter both from d linkthe wired connections worked great the wireless conections worked fine for the b addon d link notebook adapter and g builtin adapter laptops but the other laptops that had the n draft adapters would not work one n draft adapter was from dell in a brand new the other n draft adapter was from dlink scary that the dlink adapter would not connect to the dlink router even with all of the security disabled the n draft adapters would not connect to the router with security enabled and taking all of the right steps to set it up nothing would connect to the router it refused to recognize the security key after being on hold for an hour dlink tried to help me they gave me about minutes of support before dropping the call basically they gave up and said that i should return it three weeks ago i mailed the items to amazon it was well within the day window from the date of purchase i am still waiting for a refund why does it take so long obviously i can not give this product a good review between the headache of dlink and the slow response for my refund this has been a miserable experience dell tech support recommends the netgear n draft router once amazon refunds me my money that s what i ll buy 
beware of kingston rebates beware of kingston rebates of course i hope your experience would differ if you were to buy kingston product s but mine was terrible i bought a kingston compactflash card that offered a mail in rebate i promptly as in the day after i received the item delivery went to photocopy my rebate certificate and upc code and sales receipt then sent it all on its merry way yes i was well within the rebate period both for the purchase and for the postmark date my purchase was a valid retailer think huge online e tailerthe rebate required sending the entire original upc label which was like the entire outside package for my cf card about the size of  business cards when flattened no problem about two months later i get a letter saying your rebate request was denied because you failed to furnish the appropriate original upc code as required by the rebate offer well now what i can t re send the original it was already in their possession i called and they insisted on repeating what the letter said i re sent my photocopies and they said a photocopy is invalid proof of purchase after another weeks of pursuing this i figured this is their scam they simply wouldn t honor the rebate and without the original upc in my possession i couldn t really submit to their requirements if you re looking for a ram upgrade i d suggest you look at a quality company like ocz the best ! or patriot geil or corsair if you re looking for a value flash memory card i might suggest sandisk for one kingston does not make the best products they are value driven products two there are competitors to kingston with just as good or better value toperformance ratios at the same prices three kingston will not stand behind their customer as i have experienced i urge you to please be cautious of kingston and their rebate scams 
confirmed no go for dell s bought one of these fellers for my laptop to use one of the old ibm clicky type keyboards no trouble using the keyboard with any computer with a ps connector but the usb converter is not recoginzed with the dell 
poor quality on all accounts they may sound good and look good but look somewhere else for earhuggers aside from being uncomfortable they re unsteady and one sizefitsall in two plastic wraps that easily come loose from your ears as well as the actual earbuds dropping from their holders and apart from all of that the sound quality is horrific you would be best doing a search again and finding a new pair 
nike dropped the ball do not buy better options out there like many of you are thinking about i bought this through a website apple i bought it based on the name brand partnerships and design i must admit it is a very nice design in theory figuring hey nike invented this additional sensor and must have figured out a way to fit into a nice little package ill spend it doesn t fit correctly you cannot see the screen this armband is not functional i even tried to make it work by fitting some tissue at the bottom to raise it to its intended position but inevitably the tissue shifted during the run i used the nike armband a total of three times over a mile period and it caused problems during each run first i had trouble adjusting the volume second i accidentally kept pausing my workout trying to play my power song center button on nano third on my longest run just today i accidentally erased the workout trying to end the workout without taking the nano out of its case i still don t know how i did this i was so frustrated after that third negative occurrence that i immediately went out and bought a different case im not going to name drop but just type in nike armband and there are several other options okay i will name drop my favorite especially because i did not want to purchase the nike shoes was the marware sportsuit relay this set comes with a neoprene nike sensor pouch to attach to your current running shoes and a wrist arm band that covers the entire nano with room for the additional nike transmitter bottom line nike system and partnership with apple nano awesome ! honestly works perfect and i couldn t be happier so far but don t give nike any more for this specific armband hopefully we will see enough bad reports and nike will come out with a new more functional design 
didn t work at all maybe mine was broken but i don t think so because i could see a red light at all the cable ends i connected the splitter to my sound card a tb montego ddl with a cable and then tried both a and cable to my stereo no signal whatever both the and cables delivered great clean signal when plugged directly into the sound card i even used only the and cables in case the was bad still no signal i think you need to have either a very very strong signal from your source to use a passive splitter like this one or use a powered splitter 
bad constips extremely easy on carpet and if you have a lot of cds stacked at the toppoorly designed it is a vertical cd rack that doesnt have individual slots for cds so if you want a cd from the bottom of a stack you have basically pull the whole stack to get to itputting it together was a pain the one i bought i had to break a piece of metal just to fit it in its guide holes againpoorly designed doesnt even fit cds that well there are gaps and the cd casses are loose fittingpros i guess it can hold a lot of cds 
destroyed my cd i wanna give this product minus stars before the repair process there was one bad track on my cd after the repair process the entire disk was unplayable took it back for a refund with billions of cds in the world is this the best that the st century has to offer 
back up your data now i bought this drive in late and it s gone through a moderate amount of use in a home environment since then the positives first though it has an mb buffer it is very fast and can even stand its ground against some newer disks with larger buffers it does make quite a bit of noise and heats up a bit more compared to my older gig and gig wd s and the newer seagates years after purchase the drive started corrupting files like crazy wd has tools on their site to check your disk status and sure enough it was due for an rma when i checked the warranty status online months had mysteriously vanished from my warranty period the drive warranty had started months before i d purchased it ! anyway it was still valid and they sent me a replacement very quick still this is my second wd drive to die and i m going with other brands from now 
unhappy product was difficult to setup and didnt come with complete instructions had to call tech support india and after min on the phone was able to complete the installation unfotunately after all that work i discovered that my printer xerox was one of the few printers not compatable with the netgear wireless print server 
wrong discription of item i could be wrong but when i looked a this item i thought it was going to be a router that would interface to my dsl line all it is a cheap firewall with a switch not at all what i wanted the discription should say port router 
well constructed very low volume this is a very well constructed cable and is probably one of the best mini torca y cables however i have found the sound from the ipod to the receiver amplifier to be very low much much lower than the signal from a cd player of the cd output loudness this forces you to turn the sound level way up both on the ipod and on the receiver amplifier consuming lots of battery power on the ipod if you have a low power receiver amplifier you may not be able to play it loud enough the sound quality is adequate but not great as one can expect for this type of y cable regardless of build quality i also purched the nyco ipod stereo link for comparison and the sound quality is much better with a much louder output volume x louder than the monster mini torca cable the nyco is also more power efficient as it drains much less power from the ipod it does not go through the mini jack and also bypasses the volume control a good sign if you care about sound quality if you don t need to recharge your ipod while you play though the cable to a receiver amplifier i would definitely go with the nyco stereo link cable i am an audiophile enthusiast with quite a bit of experience in high end audio 
if it won t print what good is it my printing problems began two months after warranty expiration i tried every troubleshoot i could find three times what a beautiful machine it does everything very well it even looks great sitting there on the desk but what if it stops printing then what good is it i finally gave up and bought something else 
piece of junk made very cheaply the slider won t even hold the batteries in with a good enough contact to charge the batteries once i tried every available slot and they all give a poor contact avoid this charger at all costs 
it works but not as you would presume it should there is no problem with the card or capacity but when i compare my results with lexar x card there is no difference in the time it takes to store the image once you click the camera yes restoring images from the card to computer is very fast compared to my x card but while snapping photos there is no difference in speed this could be because of the camera or some other reason but my main reason to buy a x card was to snap photos as fast as possible by the way i am using this card in nikon camera make sure that your camera supports the write acceleration technology he cf card will work but there was no increase in speed over other cards 
ok so it isn t just me i ve had two of these cute lights now one was a replacement for the other as much as i enjoyed the quirky design and fun character both quickly grew so dim that they were essentially useless two is enough ! this was a product i wanted to like a design hit that turned out to be a functional flop 
be very careful i was wrongly advised by tech support to buy this instead of waiting for a new supply of power supplies from voodoo be sure your computer is supported because targus tech won t give you any info about voltage amperage or wattage on this thing so you can t safely maake it work with an unsupported computer so amazon as usual graciously took it back love amazon i just now read the other reviews and now consider myself lucky i didn t keep it and try to make it work 
works best with one pc only i have a linksys router hooked up to a power line bridge and on the other end another plb hooked up to a pc it works just fine the problem is when i add a second plb pc sometimes it works for a while and then the line drops and sometimes it doesn t work at all for some reason the ip addressing goes off when adding a second or third unit so i am constantly resetting the router cutting the power disabling and enabling the pc lan connection to manipulate them into working again frankly as you can see it s driving me up the wall i m starting to debate laying cable under my house wireless isn t an option because i use gig telephones like i said with only one pc the system is flawless 
card slot cover broke st day the cover to the slot for the card broke the st day very weak hinges and door is in an area that is most likely to get grabbed when using it 
video and audio out of sync save yourself time and aggravation and don t buy this product ! i bought this to put home movies on dvd almost every time i downloaded a home movie to my computer the audio was not in sync with the video i spent hours trying to get it right i also kept upgrading my computer thinking that was the problem i finally saw a review here explaining that the px mu is notorious for this problem so i bought a canopus advc and have not had a single problem ! 
terrible i bought one from a store which didn t work so i thought i d try amazon com well the one i order from here didn t work either rather than go through all the rigamarole i just bought a new printer i ve had no luck with hp products the printer i had bought this ink for did nothing buteat expensive cartridges when it decided to actually work that is save your money and get a better printer 
worst label maker ever the labels are sticky on one side and printable on the other but that s about all this product has going for it the software is a nightmare the print previews only vaguely represent the finished product and the program frequently and randomly alters your image i wound up using the labels but creating the documents in ms publisher what a shame 
if only the wireless part of it worked i writing this eview onthe nwkeoard tht i picked up a few urs don stop redingdue to th numerous misspellins and rors that s the kyboard nome i mt ba to to y na o y n acino esr i ia ok switching over to a wired keyboard the above mess was me trying to type on the microsoft v keyboard i m taking it back to the store asap according to the programs i have a full signal on both the keyboard and the mouse while typing but you see what comes out ! not once have i had a low signal warning or anything i just get random intermittent letters to appear now perhaps it s because the receiver is back by my monitor and the keyboard is on the keyboard tray but my goodness ! this thing is supposed to have a range of feet i measured and they re about a foot and a half apart ! i type for hours on end per day and have been typing properly for about years i type much too fast and much too frequently to be able to deal with such random signals another thing i noticed about the and actually was concerned with it while i was trying it out in the store is that it makes my fingers feel cramped perhaps it s due to the curve of the keyboard and i m just not used to it yet although i have used split key ergonomic keyboards and never had a probelm with them the felt fine even though it has a somewhat awkward layout no matter what that thing is going back ! i m far too agitated to keep it oh there are some neato plusses ! i love the shortcut keys it s nice to be able to just hit one key and get my e mail my music my pictures or whatever else i assign the keys to i had gotten excited about that feature and will be sad to lose it even though i only had it for about an hour better luck to the rest of you 
wanted to like it but when i first started using this i loved it it worked fine in my car cassette deck and had decent sound in fact i bought a second one for my wife then after about two weeks it stopped working it would no longer play in my cassette deck which ejected it as soon as i put it in every time i tried contacting coby s support on the web but they were unresponsive luckily amazon took it back for a refund note that they no longer sell these directly bet they had too many returns 
good for loud ooompa ooompa music but not if you are listening classical and have more than below average requirements regarding sound reproduction quality there is a hiss present all the time cracking noises nonlinear distortion echo and other artifacts i tried installing uninstalling drivers getting new drivers all with no effect if you want quality get external sound device from xite 
poor design lots of false alerts i purchased this to replace my year old bel i and was really disappointed it is difficult to tell in the picture but the portion of the detector that appears light grey is actually kind of silver on its own i wouldn t particularly like the color scheme but what makes the design terrible s that the shiny silver reflects on your windshield i can t believe they d think this was a good idea for some reason i was getting false laser alerts like crazy empty subdivisions on the expressway without a police car in sight parking lots at first i thought my phone might be interfering with the detector but i was getting just as many falses with the phone turned off id expect this with a cobra detector that cost half as much but this is pretty terrible based on other reviews i don t think this is isolated to a defective unit 
disappointed i have bought this cartridge from the store and then ordered them online to save money but it ended up costing me ! i only was able to print about the pictures i normally can print will never order them online again 
the darn thing locked me out the first time this product needs serious help what use is it if the first time you try it your computer is locked and won t open no matter what you do don t buy this product it s too unreliable fortunately the thing was locked to my desk and not to a library table hopefully i can spend twice what i paid for it to get the damn thing back to where i started 
serious drop in quality i have always been a fan of sony because they make quality products that are userfriendly that is why i was in a state of complete shock that this little blue cd walkman is made by sony because it is on the other end of the spectrum compared to what they usually manufacture first the bad the control buttons sound changing tracks pause etc are tiny and nearly impossible to read i found myself having to hold the cd player up to my face to find the right button and i do not have any vision problems the little lcd screen is hard to read as well next the sound quality is poor and has a cheap watered down feel to it then there are the stock headphones that the product comes with these are cheap and don t fit well i bought a yellow psyc sony walkman a couple years ago and that one is times the product that this one is the sound is near perfect and the buttons are easy to see and use the headphones fit well and the whole package has lasted with no issues at all i wouldn t write sony off simply b c of this product but i would definitely do some research prior to purchasing a walkman from them 
where has quality gone works fine looks and feels cheap very few cordless phones with speaker on handset that are wall mountable why 
device permanantly reverts to japanese language if you are considering this device be aware that it will revert from english language to japanese if it sits around without being used for a few months olympus is aware of this peculiar behavior but charges you to fix it having owned the device for several years i finally got around to sending it in to take care of this unfortunately there is a charge of to give it a hard boot according to the technician since it works fine otherwise i elected to have it sent back and i ll just have to find another brand i can rely on when this one falls apart im giving this stars because it is light and easy to carry and discreetly set on a lecturn those are its good features however the logic of the buttons is not intuitive at all and the selfdirected non reversible language adjustment is simply unacceptable i m just glad i learned how to use it before it made that adjustment ! since i drag the wav files to my ipod anyway i m going to explore that avenue for recording presentations in the future 
do not do business with bargaincell bought a cell phone battery that of course died one week past their return refund deadline refused to refund or replace even though the product is clearly defective this company is a ripoff and will never do business with them again consider yourself warned 
this sucks please don t buy it i had a linkysy router for years before i bought this piece of crap it was great so i didn t expect all the problems i am now experiencing from day one my connection has mysteriously disappeared several times a day every single day i never had this problem with my old router so i was baffled there is nothing to be adjusted nothing to fix it just cuts in and out all day long it s a horrible router the saddest part is that my connection didn t really speed up measurably i wish i hadn t wasted my money or that these things are returnable when they prove themselves worthless ! hello amazon anyone listening 
not good the lcd is easier to use than the earlier version that relied on audio clips to switch frequency you may have to experiment a good deal to find a position where the signal reaches the car radio adequately like the s rabbit ears tv antennas even then if you are in an are with good fm radio coverage it s going to be hard to find a frequency where this will work mostly you can t use this with a cover on and you ll need a car charger if you want to use it for long the all inone modulator and charger that clips to the docking connector is a better solution 
very flaky contrary to viking s reputation for quality i ve owned various viking branded memory cards in the past and have always been pleased with their performance until i purchased this gb compactflash card its possible that this card works well in other uses but i found its performance unacceptable as storage for raw images shot with my canon digital rebel slr anywhere from to of the images were corrupted particularly bad in continuous shooting mode contrast with my lexar media mb and gb cards which were able to shoot reliably with no corrupt images under the same conditions and without as much of a lag time as the viking card often left waiting seconds after shooting as few as continuous images while the card to recovers 
targus does not issue drivers for my viewsonic v it worked ok for months but the kb kept on falling off when i complained i was told that the kb was not compatible with my viewsonic v yet it was advertised as compatible with the vs ppc the worse came when i upgraded to ppc and the kb stopped working i contacted targus and was told that they do not have plans for upgrading their kb drivers for this vs ppc i do not believe that this should be permitted if you sell something stand behind it very disappointing 
disappointed on my laptop it took over an hour to transfer between photos read the fine print in the leaflet that comes with the reader and it states that it won t necessarily work with all computer systems mine is a pretty common dell laptop with brand name components when i transfered the same photos from the laptop to an external hard drive it took about seconds 
terrible product read why first of all the product does not totally inhibit the ability of someone sitting next to you on an airplane seeing your screen it just creates a more dark shadow of what s on your screen second if your screen did not have a glare before it will now with this product third there is a distracting notch at the top of the filter so you have this annoying thumb sized area and the filter does not cover do not waste you money on this m so called privacy filter 
dont store valuables on this both of my lacie big disk extremes have been returned to manufacturer within a year of purchase due to power issues in each case i have lost time and valuable data they reformat the drive after repair as stardard operating procedure lacie makes decent drives so this surprised me later models may have fixed the problem but the lacie big disk extreme has issues 
not a good product the fm tuner would not bring in a clear station without interference from nearby stations the radio part hence was worthless the speakers are sub standard no depth without the remote little can be done all in all it is not worth trying my cheap year old sony boombox is of much higher quality 
poor sound quality destroys a good idea i bought the wireless base with handsets to replace a vtec ghz setup that was being stepped on by my wireless network quite frankly i regret it sound quality on the motorola units is extremely poor sometimes and it is not predictable i have tried moving the base unit and even sitting next to the base unit when the sound quality is poor and there is little correlation to distance from the base the range is vastly inferior to the vtec ghz units i can talk on the vtechs up to ft away from the base and i can t even use the motorolas in the next room it s too bad because motorola did a good job with the features and functions i especially like the blinking light on each hand unit to notify of a waiting message the ability to have a local and global phone book is also a very good feature despite the good choice of features what good is a phone that breaks up and clicks while in use don t buy these unit 
this phone is not headset compatible this may be a perfectly good phone and i ve had great success with other uniden products but amazon s specifications for this product describe it as headset compatible this phone has no headset jack and is most definitely not headset compatible since i require a headset you can imagine how happy i am with this product 
bad design flimsy toggles junk notice all the happy five star ratings are from people that just bought this mp i have had mine for months i have had this mp since christmas i bought the white for my son at the same time whith in weeks my son s was no longer working at all he had it in his back pack and some how it got crunched enough to never work again i was not happy also in a few months mine started to have issues the very tiny menu button is rediculous and the main toggle was a complete failure for sony i accually removed the cover to the toggle and just moved the joy stick under it to change songs or volume how stupid i am so mad about this mp player i am going to buy a creative v i have done a lot of research this time and i will not buy another sony the hold button that is part of this sliding door never works i find the player dead in my gym bag all the time apparently the door slides over a bit and the player will turn on for hours and than you have a dead player maybe sony should have given us a on off button than this would not happen ! dont do it folks look into other options even my mom s ipod nano is better designed than this joke of an mp player 
garbage complete waste of money i bought two of these and neither of them holds a charge for more than a few hours even when not used definitely stick to the oem batteries 
crappy tuner i m very dissapointed with this boombox the fm tuner has too much interference the fm is fine if you listen to a strong station but if you tune to a weaker station and your close to a downtown area you will hear or strong stations bleeding through the weaker ones i ve tried ajusting the coils but this model has no ajustments for fm only am the am has bleed too so if you try to pick up distant stations at night you may hear the strong station next to it for example i live in atlanta ga so the strongest am signal is wsb so if i try to tune into wbbm at night i get bleeding through i have had other panasonic boomboxes that don t have this trouble with am so if you listen to the radio like i do please check it out you ll see what i mean i hope panasonic will correct this on future model 
junk ! it wouldnt go feet or line of sight i got this and was excited i can get almost any product to work i was thinking all of those other guys are wrong i ll order this and it will work fine nope ! i installed it and there were lines across the video and the audio would cut in and out i messed with it for another hour turning off every other thing in the house cordless phones included still the same thing and i was only going through walls a total of feet so just for the heck of it i gave them line of sight a foot span line of sight nothing blocking them noting in the house turned on i even unplugged my microwave like the instructions suggest still the same issue with the video and the audio don t waste your time on this i wanted to crush them but i sent them back to amazon instead 
cheap i got this with the cd player and they broke after two weeks they just aren t durable make an investment and buy good headphones that don t break 
unresolved problem i am still awaiting resolution of a problem i have with these drives in writing dvds i get verification errors this proboem arises if the drives are used in an external firewire enclosure the drive works fine if internal in your computer attached to the ide bus but there is an issue if attached to your computer by firewire 
goes to goodwill dont throw out your old tv yet i have no clue what this little thing is about dummy me thought i bought a nice little tv but it reminds me of those little cards you d get with chewing gum and every time you moved it in your hand the image changed that s what you experience when you move around in the room and still want to follow a show you cannot watch this thing with somebody else seated say feet away from you the other person or you gets a foggy image or just dark shapes up close you see hardly anything buyers beware this is not a working tv one star for the batteries in the remote 
just a comment about the different circuits this is not technically a review although based on what i ve read i do plan on buying one of these however i found something on smarthome com which will inter connect the two main circuits that most houses have thus allowing devices like this and x work from any outlet to any other this is not yet tested by me but is at least promising device is here httpwwwsmarthomecombhtmlexplanation is here httpwwwsmarthomecomimagesdgmbigjp 
this thing is a hunk of junk don t believe the last review i had mine about a month before i tossed it out the window somewhere near charlotte nc nothing but problems barely recieved or transmitted and was extremely weak when it did i actually had truckers ask me to stop transmitting because all they could hear was squealing when i keyed tossed it kept my k antenna bought a uniden prow and have loved it ! much better radio ! don t buy anything cobra makes 
returned in days i returned this product in exactly days my bad for not doing the research and looking at reviews i bought this based on the store demo and the bose name and reputation the promise of an easy hookup minimal wiring and only speakers had great appeal to my wife i could not get video on some of my dvds which apparently a common complaint on the boards and those that did get video were very pixelated the sound played off my cable tv was very uneven the unit utilizes s video and has only optical input and coaxil input as soon as i read the reviews it was clear that this product has been less than stellar and for i was not taking chances my dvd player does a better job with an hdmi hookup my old receiver purchased in the late s has more optical inputs and i stuck it out with my old system as unsightly as that seems to my wife i think there is a market for this type of product but poor execution here by bose 
good fan but don t buy from amazon this is a good fan but it was left on the front porch just sitting there wasn t even in a shipping box just the box it is manufactured with and you can also get it for about cheaper at walmart or kmart 
faulty chip i dont know if it was a flaw with my card alone or what but my mb xd card could hold up to images on my mp camera but when i put in the mb it only had space for what a watse of money 
great tv for the price i like the fact that you can save money with not having a tuner that you do not need the monitor is light and was easy to hook up the picture even not in high definition is great dvd s look great on the screen although the picture in widescreen does not fill the screen as you would think it would that is the one downside to this otherwise great television 
okay i guess while the silicon used in the construction of the sleeve is very nice feels grippy but not sticky if you know what i mean some of the features are just wrong for instance the opening for the hold switch on top was apparently cut wrong and does not line up with the switch at all requiring you to have to push the cover around so you can flip the hold on or off also for whatever reason the edge of the sleeve is right at the headphone jack which causes it to be somewhat difficult to keep some headphones seated during use the sleeve can work its way in and pop the jack out the armband is satisfactory at best it s just a standard no frills velcro armband 
or more handsets are a problem i agree with others that this phone has great sound and range however there are two design flaws that i d like to point out if you have more than two hand sets on one base and two or more people in your house and the phone rings there could be a problem if two people pick up handsets to answer at the same time only one will actually be connected to the incoming call the loser will get an error tone and not hear any of the conversation so if the incoming call is not for the winner how does he tell the other person the call is for her which handset do you transfer the call to you do not know which handset she picked up with old hardwired extension phones you simply determined who the caller wanted and the other party hung up now so easy with this phone the keypad lock feature actually increases the chances of a child dialing random digits to call by accident ! yes when locked the keypad only allows dialing it does this by rejecting all digits except so if the keypad is locked and a kid dials and eventually hits the green pick up phone button it will call any random string of digits with digits and in it will look like to this phone however if you live alone and have no small children this phone is great 
great when it works when the inno works it is great receives strong signals in nyc and easy to operate however my commute is around minutes each way and the battery has died on occasion once every time i switched to the mp player it would shut down i had to restore it and load and set options again now it works in the car through my stereo but not head phones i get noise like an am radio hopefully it will get resolved in a timely matter 
good print quality lousy ink usage recently i bought an epson r to replace my epson r big mistake after only or so prints the printer ran out of ink i mean all six cartridges were almost empty black was totally out first i thought well maybe the cartridges that came with the original packaging were not totally full i went out and got me a new set of six cartridges dolars after prints again out of ink i used to get about with the old r it is ridiculous you actually see the ink level go down as you print excelent print quality lousy ink usage did i mention that i was using the lowest possible setting for the quality of prints when i contacted epson the answer was get the continuos flow ink system nice answer 
doesnt work it just dont work in the whole dial there s no single fm station that transmit load and clean to much noise 
now only if it actually works i am now the proud owner of an archos after spending one traumatic month having owned in my opinion the far inferior archos inferior you say but the has a larger screen better battery life a removable battery and much larger hard drive capacities even for the gb how then can i say that it is a far inferior product well primarily because the archos actually works while the much to my dismay does not you see beneath that beautiful metallic exterior and beautiful screen of the archos lies a niggling problem that archos doesnt want you to know about especially if you live in a hot and dry location this product is extremely and i mean extremely sensitive to electro static discharge esd and hangs almost instantaneously if you expose it to even the slightest amount of static using this player had become an absolute nightmare for me whenever i was listening to music and would for example want to see which track is playing or skip to the next track etc i would simply touch the player whether in its case or outside and not even press a button and it would hang instantly soon after i actually used to become nervous every time i needed to touch the player and soon developed a habit of beforehand touching a metallic object eg doorknob every time i needed to use the player needless to say when one has to do such things just to touch a device it kind of ruins the experience of owning that device the suffers from none of these problems i have been using it for over a month now and it has not even frozen once having said that however i still give this product two stars instead of just one because a the video playback is very good much better than the and not only because of the larger screen b the battery life is decent and the battery is removable and c it offers capacities larger than most other video players available today as for the sound anyone interested in an archos series product should know that the volume on these players is significantly lower than the others even with the latest firmware i have made a direct comparison using the same pair of headphones with the g ipod ipod nano cowon a cowon x and creative zen vision m either owned by me or by friends and they are all louder than the archos better i cannot say as that is subjective but certainly and verifiably much louder 
roll the dice this one is a gamble i purchased this item and one month later i still have not received any paperwork i emailed and have not received a reply 
nifty but kind of cheap quality likely discontinued because i bought this on sale at frys for only it was worth that price like the other reviewer said it dominates the electrical receptacle even a four plugger becomes hard to use radio sounds very tinny but works ok it picks up the local am stations i have it on the wall in a workshop where the nicely lit digital clock comes in handy one problem i noticed was that there is a loud hum when i played the radio while it was plugged in nothing else active on the line i got around this by clipping a thin ground wire to the outside antenna this seemed to also boost am reception 
no range i purchased these radios for a back up so to speak for my elderly mother we live approximately mile from each other and i wanted her to be able to reach me if she had an accident and could not get to a phone these walkie talkies worked great within feet of her house but after that the range lost any chance of hearing her i would not reccomend them to anyone who needs something to rely on 
beware ! no hdmi cable specs look good hdmi a p firmware upgrade over ethernet etc the unit seems to be solid heavy and well built however toshiba chose to ship this hd dvd player with only a composite a v cable yellow red white rca jacks in the box the best resolution you can get with this cable is i and not even as good as an s video connection for that it is pretty amazing that a high end consumer electronics device which is advertised for its high definition capabilities and hdmi a interface is being shipped without a cable set component video or hdmi that actually makes it possible for the customer to connect it to an hdtv i don t know how much cost savings toshiba gets out of not including a cable that costs less than now let s get to the real review pros one of the best features of this unit is its capability to upscale regular dvds to p the upscaling is very high quality the unit also has various noise reduction options that help with some of the poorly mastered dvds if the weight of the unit is any indication build quality is high it has an ethernet port for firmware updates and possible future functionality cons very slow boot time takes longer to boot than my windows xp pc especially durimg p hd dvd playback the unit gets very hot make sure your enclosure rack is open in the back there is a somewhat loud fan unit in the back of the player this player has no zoom scaling functions for dealing with non anomorphic dvds so you have to use your tvs scaling function kind of a pain since the image quality suffers when the video has to go through two parallel scalers 
complete junk i bought these radios for their size and supposed range i installed the battery packs set the frequencies and was impressed at how compact solid and function packed they seemed to be that was where it all ended i hadn t been using them for ten minutes when little bursts of static came over the line my freind kept calling and asking if i had said something the squelch seems to not be very discriminating when it differentiates between an actual transmission and background noise ironically his transmissions kept cutting out mid sentence now and then following each transmission assuming you can hear what the other person is saying because of the lousy speakers on these things see below is another burst of static that can last anywhere from to seconds extremly irritating it comes with a vibration mode when the call button is activated presumably so if someone is in a loud environment they can tell when someone is trying to contact them i m not exactly sure why they bother with this as the lousy speakers they put on these things is barely audible even with the volume turned all the way up so there s no way you can hear anyone s transmission in a noisy environment anyway the lithium ion battery packs aren t bad they probably have a good life to them but i was so fed up with all the other funtional flaws i ended up returning the radios before i had a chance to test battery in conclusion avoid these radios ! they are junk they have extremly limited range and they don t work well under the best of conditions 
horrible horrible is the only word i can think of to describe this product i ll preface my comments by saying that i do not consider myself to be an audiophile i am an average guy who wanted to be able to listen to my sirius sat radio or ipod throughout my house and in my backyard while relaxing or entertaining here was my experience with these speakers i received them on friday they were very easy to setup and connected easily to my sirius receiver in my office the first thing i didn t like about the speakers was that even when connected to the power supply they were not very loud at max volume in a quiet office they were at a decent volume but not what i consider to be loud more of a background ambience level not a pure listening volume i then took the speakers into my backyard i set them on my patio roughly feet from the transmitter but outside of my brick house the sound quality was horrible lots of popping hissing and drop outs while only feet from the transmitter i opened my windows in my office tried all of the avaialble channels nothing improved the reception when i could hear these speakers at full volume they were barely loud enough to hear about feet away from the speakers it was impossible to hear them at all in the furthest corner of my yard i tried moving the speakers to that corner of the yard and completely lost the signal from the transmitter about feet from my house nothing but static at that point this morning i took the speakers into my kitchen roughly feet from the transmitter with walls between the only place i could get a signal on the speakers was sitting them on top of my fridge while there was no popping while in the kitchen the hissing was considerably more pronounced in the house the volume was good while in the kitchen and could be heard anywhere within that area but that also includes hearing the hissing throughout the entire space this morning i contacted amazon to return these speakers since they did not meet my expectations to add insult to injury amazon will be charging me to return the speakers as well as the shipping to send them to me since they were over i got the free super saver shipping i guess it s only free if you keep the item if you return it amazon will charge you therefore it s going to cost me about to find out these speakers are horrible as a solution for all of you who are looking for the ability to hear your music in every room of your house do an amazon search for whole house fm transmitter gold for less than these speakers you can buy a whole house fm transmitter and pick up your sat radio ipod tv etc off of a crystal clear fm signal i received one of these units yesterday as well and i am keeping this it produced a signal i could pick up on every radio inside and outside of my house including my basement i will replace these sony wireless speakers with an under cabinet radio for my kitchen and a boombox for my backyard my recommendation is to avoid these horrible srs rfrk speakers 
uncomfortable fit mediocre sound the sony mdr if headphones have average sound quality and are very uncomfortable to wear perhaps if one were an elf or a small child they would fit properly however if you re like me a mere adult mortal they probably won t fit you they would be okay for simple stereo listening but not the kind of superlative sound experience suggested in the description if you re looking for a solid pair of headphones for casually listening to music or watching your favorite movie the sony mdr if are vastly superior headphones and well worth the extra money 
bad quality i bought this item like months ago and now it s broken i m sooo frustrated i d not recommend buying this item 
they denied the rebate request what a rip off your rebate submission has been received unfortunately your rebate is denied for the following reasons request postmarked after close of program deadlinerequired postmark before actual postmark there was absolutely no cut off submission deadline given except the purchase by date and submit within a certain time after receiving purchase all were followed to the ti submitted the rebate immediately after i received the merchandise from amazon give me a break i ll never touch another thing from viking except with a pole if it was not so piddling an amount this would be worth reporting to fcc but the state of customer protection in this country make you jump through even more hoops probably for nothing more heartache just forego rebates send viking back to the boat and purchase another brand 
discontinued for good reason completely useless only shows a digital display when ipod is fully charged how long does your ipod stay fully charged even when showing digital display doesn t actually broadcast maxell replaced it with the p a for a reason amazon shouldn t even be selling this it makes me distrust amazon i got it as a christmas present but it was bought in october so they won t even take it back follow up after i emailed amazon they issued a complete refund which they refused to do over the phone now they just need to pull the product since they probably wisely aren t carrying the p a and therefore can t recommend it as an option 
product does not fit dvd outer title inserts i returned this product as it does not accommodate the outer title insert only the inner page product recommended for customers who do not wish to keep the outer slipcase cover page 
technology not up to date i wanted to stay with linksys and the ports would have been a perfect fit but unfortunately i had to return mine the usb port is not compatible with a lot of hp printers hp in my case linksys could not troubleshoot the problem and had nothing in their system about my hp printer hard to believe when random consumer comments in amazon have better info than a manufacturers knowledge base i wonder if they know who hp is hp eventually helped confirm linksys needed to update this product better go with another brand the replacement port iogear was a little harder to set up due to a fixed ip need but it is doing the job 
not worth the trouble this card died on me after about a year of use my laptop will detect the card but it won t power up my reaction good riddance ! i now have an excuse to get a different card as others have stated this card uses its own drivers and they don t work well everytime i woke my laptop from suspend mode the card would fail to reconnect to the network forcing me to remove and reinsert the card then do a repair of my connection huge hassle it looks like you get what you pay for with these cards so stay away from the cheap ones ! 
interference w ghz telephone bad customer service i tried to install at my house with only feet range but i was getting static noise only way i could make it work was by disconnecting our ghz cordless telephone panasonic unit i tried to contact the customer service but nobody are answering the phone i was on hold for minutes twice and it was answered by a voice mailbox 
no cash back here please don t expect to get the cash back from this purchase as promised ! to date i ve been denied twice the second time they said the u p c number was invalid only it s the original u p c barcode ! i was meticulous filing the paperwork yet they state all required products were not submitted meanwhile i have phoned amazn to lodge a formal complaint the product itself is average i ve used better and worse that said it s definitely not worth the full asking price 
is this a joke this must be some sort of joke to release this mouse for sale it looks nice and the hot link buttons function well as a pointing tool though it is utterly useless it is so sensitive that the slighest move sends your pointer to the corner of the screen at first i thought that maybe i needed to adjust to the new mouse or better yet perhaps adjust the sensitivity option you cannot adjust the sensitivity on to option option maybe it s just me unfortunately not when the mouse sits untouched on my desk the pointer is slowly drifting across my monitor screen sometimes when i try to use it to select something it is impossible i junked this pos and went back to my older dell logitech mouse 
crappp sure it gives you better signal strength but it doesnt detect all network connections do not buy this ite 
sound is disappointing i bought this product to use in my small office knowing that with the size of the speakers the sound would not be suitable for loud playing or large areas with this in mind i have to say that i found the sound to be poor even with the bass turned up and the treble down it still sounded tinny and weak i did like the fact that it accommodated my older st generation ipod and had several attachments for the various versions of ipods i bought it because it did accept my older ipod and because of the price but i sent it back and bought the im which has great sound and accepts my old ipod for a price that is not that much more 
i wish i could pick zero stars for this piece of junk unfortunately when i bought this thing it was new on the market so the horror stories that are seemingly abundant now weren t around to warn me off back then needless to say i have been plagued by problems with my pmc from quite early on my pmc has since totally died and despite testing with new batteries etc turns on but does not respond rubbish considering i paid this is unacceptable to add insult to injury iriver north america has not responded to my emails therefore the warranty i paid for is effectively useless please don t buy this product there are other portable media centers out there like the toshiba gigabeat and the dreameo but i m really not sure if they re any good either like others here i am doing my utmost to warn people away from making the mistake of buying one of these infernal contraptions a 
nice hardware really bad drivers ever since i loaded the targus drivers on my tungsten c the battery discharges quickly and won t take a full charge ive removed the driver with no change the next step was to do a hard reset of the tungsten c and i m hoping it will take charge im taking this keyboard back for a full refund 
piece of junk this thing is a joke it doesn t play loud enough except for low volume listening there is no handle to make moving it easy cheap flimsy construction and a door that you know is going to break soon no battery back up for the memory i would rather pay more and get something better i am going to return it 
wide stipes the paper stripes of are too wide at times information such as names and phone numbers came out very clear if somebody is really after information he shouldn t have much trouble finding it after you throw away your paper 
very disappointed received this as a christmas present and was initially excited about it the setup application worked well and i was able to enter all of my devices and create activities after many hours of tweaking the activities functions i returned the device very disappointed here are the reasons i was disappointed the letters numbers on the buttons and screen were too small for me to read the number buttons were at the bottom of the remote in a very inconvenient location the buttons were too close together and too small making it difficult to press the correct button without activating adjacent buttons when watching a dvd i sometimes use the tv for the sound source or use the receiver for the sound source although i can program two activities one for rcvr sound and one for tv sound it can t automatically mute the sound of the device that you don t want to be the sound source as a result it takes manual intervention to turn the sound down on the device you aren t using this makes the remote entirely useless for my purpose as i wanted to be able to provide my spouse a single button to push for the activity she wanted without having to use other controls or remotes so i m impressed with the theory behind the remote i just think it needs some more work to perfect it 
stopped working after two months i saw several people state that this product stopped working after a short while but it seemed like a reputable company and i liked the idea of a charger that i could continue to use if i got a new laptop so i went ahead and bought it taking my chances it began flickering in and out of power after two months and now hardly works at all i should have bought the ibm product to match my computer it might just be the tip which needs to be replaced but at bucks a pop i don t want to have to replace these every two months dont buy it 
car adapter for gps was sold to me as an accessory but wasn t needed because there was already one that came with the gps had to return it 
can t connect with computer it s my first time heard a digital recorder can t connect with computer it is very strange i think it s not fit for me 
not evey good enough to be a toy i am very unhappy about this i need to buy a good name brand for an instrument this is poor quality and i returned it very displeased 
don t bother this product is useless i purchased it because i have the new ipod video player which is a little more fragile then the previous well i see this product which i thought would be great but it most certainly is not ! its awful there were air pockets all over and no matter how much i tried my brother tried or my friends the air pockets would not go away if you want air pockets all over your viewing screen then get this if not i would suggest somthing different ! this is horrible and a waste of money 
worthless unit i went with this unit based on the magellan name but have been very disappointed the magellan name doesn t mean what i tought it did it worked fine for a week then became very sporadic at holding a signal tech support had me ship the unit back for repair and it was returned two weeks later with the same problem that led to more calls to tech support with long waits on hold only to be told i had to ship the unit back again for repair i m hold again now as i write this bottom line is that i ve owned this unit for nearly two months and have gotten maybe hours of use out it save your money buy another brand or just get a map 
short life i bought this thing because i lost a memory mod to a power surge it worked fine at first but now it has no battery life recently the power went out and my computer shut off immediately like it was not on a backup at all of course the alarm was still screaming but so what my computer was already shut off without any warning i had this thing for two years but i will be going with a different brand next time 
poor delivery and horrible customer care strategy used this unit for a while but complaints about line static by my phone counterparts were consistent and energetic did not use the unit for six months tried to use the unit today after it was sitting safely in a seldom used drawer system failed to activate at all tried resetting called the customer service number on back of the unit to see what could be done if anything after the phone self help proved useless very user unfriendly i struggled to get out of the loop finally reached a voice who put me on hold came back and they transferred me to another technician where my call was dropped the customer service number on the website sent me into a new self help h ll i just needed it to work with my dish network i am using the recommendation on this site to use the sbc unit save yourself a lot of annoyance and move on 
horrible there is essentially no sound amplification the sound levels are barely different with the thing on as opposed to having it off sort of a what were they thinking product 
expensive and hard to find the suspicious side of me wants to believe that hp did a promo with their deskjet c i e they sold the printer cheap or with big rebates as part of a system deal and decided to make up for their loss leader by limiting production and raising the price on the cartridge replacements i would be surprised if there is any difference between the c black replacement cartridge c and the much more common cartridge for the c other than a little plastic tab on the cartridge case 
very annoying i ve owned this for a year and am looking for a new keyboard i have continual connection problems with mouse and keyboard and continually have to reset low battery warnings appear every day this keyboard was not cheap and i thought microsoft could do better but i can t afford to waste my time trying to type a sentence 
not plug and play i got this mouse a few days ago so i cannot comment on the quality of the mouse itself however this is the first usb mouse i have ever encountered that must have an installation cd to work after installing the software on my portable computer i realized that my touchpad had stoped working after a lot of consultaion i have not advanced competence in computer skills i figured that the software had unistalled my previous drivers making my touchpad mouse malfunktion i had to reistall this only to realize that now my kensington mouse did not work after a lot of trouble i finally got it to work but this is not the way a typically plug and play product such as an usb mouse are supposed to work in my mind ! 
for wilderness use i m using this in an area where as usual there is no map data for the trails and roads navigating through old and obscured trail systems or just passable terrain to known trails i ve been on is very cumbersome requiring switching between screens and allot of thumb work when i should have my chin up navigating even then the functionality is very limited seems a big step forward on the software would make this product a really great tool but so far it s only a novelty item in order to view the other trails in the area previously recorded i will need to purchase the mapsend software which contains no useful data for me only provides the functionality of editing creating my own base map a function i can only do on my laptop something i usually don t carry out into the wilderness basically i bought this to use it to document my assaults on various ridges passes peaks and unknown road systems while understanding my proximity to previously traveled routes to help me make progress so far it s a points in this department if you want to find your way back to points this is useful however for other types of navigation involving linear objects such as trails and roads waterways the software isn t there yet 
the colors are great but kills budget system performance i purchased this agp to run d software occasionally and not really for games i updated the bios directx and video drivers before installing the card and loading it s support software the manual was a general manual that wasn t specific to my card it recommend exiting hardware wizard and running the ati install the amount of software that was installed was overwhelming and unnecessary all you need is catalyist and the drivers not file player all inonewonder remote wonder multimedia library unless you plan to watch tv on the pc i don t the card has no fan but a large heat sink i have a sempron with gb ram additional cooling fans and watts with all that the system was shutting down from overheating i lessen the resolution and refresh rate to no avail the card showed rich cooler and the built in d configuration pc check and screen savers worked with no problem but just doing web surfing playing quicktime running d screensaver causes overheating no games the video payback was choppy my onboard video that came with the motherboard outperformed the card but can t run d as a test the card couldn t run even the most basic d game demo even in it s lowest detail settings i returned the card after that the overheating and shutdowns went away it maybe a great card for larger systems but for budget system it s a performance killer it has overheating issues the support software did little to prevent system crashes 
junk i bought this radio as a christmas gift for my seven year old son the cd player did not work it was a bummer also when i bought it i did not know that is was a refurbished unit 
in cold temperatures won t stick great design but unfortunately wouldn t stay stuck in cold temperatures i have a saturn and the vent clip was not an option for me 
garbage stopped working after months of extremely gentle use i never even traveled with it it just stopped working completely making me lose data never again i ll buy anything from this company this drive is a piece of rubbish ! 
dwt double wide disc dvd tower was a little hard putting it together you have to be very careful taking the cds out or it would fall apart i am not happy with this product 
waste of time money upon testing this antenna i soon noted the signal strength significantly weaker both for transmittiny and recievin 
not good i purchased this product december of i got it and was very very pleased with it video music pictures fm radio fm radio recording was all good never used the microphone after about months after purchasing this product i went to charge and add music to the player and the usb cord could not be recognized by my computer i have read reviews of this happening and still decided to purchase it anyway wrong move everything i tried that the tech support told me to do via email because your phone support help expires after days i believe did not help luckily i purchased from amazon and was able to return it but with a restocking fee deducted from my refund i don t know if its just the creative zen vision m that has this problem but i suggest that you do not buy this product to find out do not buy this product 
poor sound quality i recently bought this radio primarily for my car but also got the home dock it was easy to set up and install both types of kit unfortunately the sound quality was very poor in both configurations the fm modulator for the car was pretty close to hopeless it only has maybe channels i found one that was free luckily but even with a clear channel the sound had a terrible hiss that went up and down in volume at apparent random even when everything was stationary the occupied channels actually worked about as well still lots of hiss except when the underlying channel broke through even disregarding the hiss the sound quality on the music was not very good i thought the problem was probably with the fm modulator so i tried it in the home dock connected to a very good home hi fi system the hiss was gone but the sound quality was completely unacceptable for whatever reason this particular receiver doesn t like the compression artifacts very much satellite radio quality is at best about like an average mp with highly compressed signals some channels better than others this receiver seemed to exacerbate the effect and it sounded a lot like a tin can and string telephone most of the time it was vert irritating very quickly the form factor about the size of a modern walkie talkie was fine and pretty easy to fit in the car it also seemed to be pretty solidly built but all of that is completely moot if it doesn t work properly i returned the receiver and both kits the next day 
great tools we used these radios on a corvette road tour to the national convention in san antonio had no problems great response batteries appear to last more than a few days 
tv ok service from amazon buyer beware buyer be ware if you have a problem with delivery or the tv you will be left on your own to sort it out amazon may or may not be a big trust worthy company but they will still leave it to you to sort out there is no personal customer service other then email run around bare that in mind before making any large purchase may be better to pay a little more through a company with a store front at least you will have someone to complain to face to face or take the item back 
truly frustrating like a xk this thing is beautifully styled and utterly unreliable it randomly loses connectivity to both my intellimouse and my ms usb keyboard secondes go by and then it reconnects sometimes to redisconnect within seconds sometimes it ll stay connected for half an hour at a time weirdly it seems to maintain connectivity to the monitor though often as a generic display rather than as a flat panel samsung i used an iogear two port kvm successfully until i got the third machine going but i got sucked in by the style my mistake ! i give it stars for performance stars for style average stars 
disappointed i purchased of these units and were either doa or had to be returned because of assorted defects i replaced them with the media carousels by ziotek the software from ziotek is not as sophisticated as disc stakka s but ziotek s units are a higher quality product and hold more dvds 
hard to get into the plastic is really thick and hard to get an ipod mini in and out of if you move your ipod between docking stations and speakers this is too cumbersome to deal with 
linksys befsr v problems i had an old linksys port router and it was a fairly decent router as it got old it became quirky and i replaced it with a new befsr v the v was a piece of junk it was unstable and unusable i took it back for a refund how disappointing that the new product is so much worse than the old one 
customer centres are no good it was a nice little thing for a couple of months after that it just froze aparently that happens often with cowan wheres the pride anyways since then it s a drag to repair the unit i would definately advise the people to buy an ipod 
just say no this goes down as one of the worst products that i have ever purchased to call it retractable is a joke the concept of the product is great the casing of the cables looks great but the functionality was a big disappointment i could pull the cables out but the cheap retraction mechanism would never allow the cables to go back into the case don t waste your time with this one as you will end up returning it as i did 
would be great if it was usable i was excited to receive the product however it did not fit my laptop everytime i opened the lid a popping sound would occur turns out the rear right back panel was rubbing the lid casing i took the laptop out and placed it back in thinking it was not properly installed same issue im not telling anyone not to buy this product just be cautious and i hope you have better luck then i did 
bad choice one star is being generous i bought this router to replace my worn out year old linksys router seemed like a good deal cheap the trendnet router was deemed defective after spending two hours on the phone with an outsourced trendnet tech who seemed to have less of an idea than i did on how to get it going don t buy one i went to the local electronics store and bought another linksys it set up perfectly the first try minutes after i got it home 
mine broke after months and day good while it lasted pos broke yesterday for no reason won t read anything i put in it phillips customer service was no help i have to buy and new dvd player and it won t be a phillips 
ads tech video xpress usbav ef can capture analog video and produce cd roms but i expected the ability to produce dvd 
didn t work for my dvd player this was listed as compatible with daewoo dvd players but did not work for mine customer support said that i would have to ship the remote to them and they would re program it which didn t seem worthwhile for such a cheap product 
poor quality control i received a black and a color ink cartridge for a hp deskjet c the black cartridge worked fine the first color cartridge flat out did not work the printer said it was defective and refused to even try to print with the color cartridge i sent the color cartridge back and received a second color ink cartridge this one worked but about half of the cyan orifices did not work when the test page was printed so i sent this second color ink cartridge back also i am waiting to receive my third cartridge the service and turnaround is great emails fly forth on shipping dates and apologies for the defective cartridges 
unusable but perhaps so due to b wireless and apptmnt the phone was unusable due to high static yet it might be because of the number of wireless data networks around my appartment and yes i did charge the battery for hrs before use 
awful these are awful i ve used another brand s iron on transfers before with no problem these not only made all the whites in the design yellow ish but they fell apart on the first wash even turning them inside out 
disappointed by timex i ve had a very difficult time finding an alarm clock with the bright indiglo light so i was happy to find this one however with my first eagle the alarm didn t go off amazon was great about the exchange for a new one kudos my repacement is a disappointment in that sometimes the backlight won t light up and i have to hit the clock on the bottom to get the light to go on i second the others raters who have complained about the bad viewing angle the loud alarm almost gave me and my wife a heart attack the first morning but i put a piece of scotch tape over it and that seem to tame it enough 
faulty wiring i detest this printer i ve bought quite a few printers in my day lexmark canon and have been quite happy with most hp s but this was the pits the first one i brought home worked fine the first time but when i tried to turn it on the next day it wouldn t cut on it just died on me i unplugged it plugged it back it then it worked for a little while before dying again this time for good i returned it got another one same problem except this time it keeps going all i have to do is unplug it before each and every time i turn it on nice huh now i m browsing online again and i ve learned my lesson for sure no more el cheapo models i m at least going to shell out for a midline price with some heft to it that will last me a year or two 
absurd lured by the attractive price and high storage i decided to step outside the world of cf cards and try the microdrive as a professional photographer who shoots primarily studio work i disregarded how fragile these cards are whispered to be after all i m not even walking around with my camera right after the second week i noticed a cf err pop on my canon hmm probably just an oddity two weeks later a longer cf err had to pop the card out and back in i lost about eight shots well today it s dead i don t mean not fast which it never was i don t mean buggy which it always was i mean dead d eadof course amazon won t take it back because i just passed my days ! yay what a waste i will never buy another seagate product again 
broke in less than a year the player stopped working after only a few months it would accept dvds but not play them and refuse to eject them that behavior started out as intermittent but it finally gave up the ghost and swallowed a dvd and never let go we had to take the player apart just to get the dvd out before throwing the player away in the trash our previous dvd player lasted over years before it started skipping this one lasted less than a year before it stopped working altogether what a waste save your time and money and buy another machine 
don t waste your money the recorder pen looks nice but doesn t work very well i could never get mine to turn on without taking it apart jiggling the batteries and then trying to turn it on again your money is better spent on a non china made product 
inconsistent quality the first pmdvr i owned worked extremely well for about years after it began to fail i purchased more one of the two never worked consistently and failed completely in about a month the other failed in about months of light use even inexpensive remotes should last longer 
poor performer this little d link box is reasonably simple to configure and use even using fast broadband service at both ends audio quality was rather poor i suspect the microphone is not very good and the video was awful mainly because of the camera s extremely poor quality i wonder what possessed d link to fit such a device with a camera that s about the same level of quality as a usb webcam under ordinary interior lighting conditions it is impossible to get a clear naturally colored picture all you will get is a noisy muddy mess of course the lens quality matches the image sensor it s awful this is a real shame because d link almost made a pretty good product here the user interface and configuration are reasonably simple and well explained in the manual and the performance passable unfortunately the built in microphone and camera are so bad they make an otherwise fairly decent product unusable 
about this thing this product is not for the heavy handedafter weeks of use one of the slots was non functional because spring leaf to hold the card against the contacts some how managed to get bent into the path of the card and seeing that the slot is for a flash card it is almost impossible to get any tool to fit to do any repairson the bright side it did work with the stated flash types 
rip off i m evaluating the dvi version the cables are sold seperately so what s the point to buy a kvm without cables lastly hearing the problems doesn t surprise me as working with the two port version i had some problems where computers becames unresponsive 
couldn t get it to work i experienced what seemed to be a common problem for many people that have purchased av cables for the ipod i was able to get the audio but no picture was available despite following the advice of other reviewers to set my tv out signal to on it didn t help that no manual was included in the box to assist with troubleshooting 
service was poor not prime as advertized when i ordered i ordered based on getting day delivery using my amazon prime prepaid delivery i highly recommend doing this if you buy or more items a year on amazon however the confirmation showed days delivery when i tried to cancel with the provider vendor my request was ignored never a response and amazon had no way to help me out of the order that i needed much sooner i finally got the order within that much longer window i like the product but am apalled that amazon let this vendor play the switch game on the delivery i notice amazon pulled the prime statement but that did not help me i had to buy on the outside to get the product in time and now have double the number i needed do no use this product unless you have a ton of time to wait and can not find fuji a clean set never a miss vs reliability on verbatim 
worked while it worked i liked this machine while it worked but i started having problems finalizing discs a bit ago i got busy and suddenly the warranty was up and then the other day it just wouldn t turn on at all i had it for months 
bsod with installation i too experienced the blue screen of death on my laptop which has xp pro on it i had to uninstall the card software in order to stop my system from continuously rebooting on another note the install of the router was great regardless i didn t get anywhere with the tech support group and had to return everything anthon 
dead on arrival i got this pen after we did a case study for this product in our class i was all excited when the product arrived but it would not even charge when i plugged it in i just shelved all plans to digitize my writing i will stick to my good old scanner for now 
not exceptional i don t even use it anymore didn t think it was that great i got a gel rest from fellows a lot better 
poor sound quality i needed a new headset to use with ventrillo online voice chat for gaming and i needed two requirements must go through the usb port because my mic port is broken and must be wireless because i constantly trip over the wire on my logitech headset when making quick trips from the computer to the kitchen which is why my logitech headset broke in the first place this microsoft headset fits both requirements so i bought it unfortunately the sound quality is horrible it sounds like you are talking over the phone like someone calling in to a radio show it is not crystal clear sound at all my guild mates on ventrillo laughed at me so much that i put this headset aside and slapped my logitech headset together with masking tape 
too quirky after purchasing these earbuds for a bargain price a few days ago i was ecstatic with the initial quality i heard from the tracks i was playing on my zen but for all the package s hype including a tag proclaiming some kind of award the earbuds had won in the philips surround sound earbuds aren t all they re cracked up to be after the somewhat promising initial tests it took me only a couple more uses to realize that the eq and frequency response on these puppies was way out of whack to say the least the product specs on the package claimed the earbuds to have a maximum frequency pick up of khz which is interesting considering the human ear can only hear to just below that level so theoretically these earbuds can deliver any and all sound the media dishes out right not only did i notice significant attenuation on the higher frequencies when the volume of my zen was turned up barely past the halfway mark but also a complete domineering of the low end sounds in whatever media happened to be playing just try playing some ambient music with these things to get an idea of the frustration i felt trying to enjoy some relaxing vibes amidst all the jarring distortion and ringing i was hearing there doesn t seem to be a feasible solution to this either as the earbuds seemed completely oblivious to my efforts of adjusting the eq output on my player additionally the assymetrical cord design seems a bit of a silly concept considering the undue amount of pull and tug it places on the left earbud causing it to fall out a little too easily ranting aside though those of you seeking out something better than the stock earbuds your portable music player has provided you with should probably keep searching 
did not work well with di router i bought this to hook to my dlink di router in order to reach a wireless device at the other end of the house it did not help at all i am returing it i talked to a dlink tech person and he said that the di did not have enough power to effectively drive this antenna and he was not surprized that it did not work in my application 
great product if i could use it i did the research on this product and it was one of the best i don t know that to be true due to the fact that the software that they sent me was a demo version that was outdated for use i have to buy another software package to opperate the product that had stated in the description that the software was included one if not the only reason i had purchased it i e mailed tiger com and received no reply if your going to sell something false advertisement is not the way 
don t buy terrible terrible product like so many others in these reviews i should have read them first ! i can categorically say that this is one of the worst software hardware products i ve ever bought it does not work tech support is useless and you should not even try to make it work i am a computer expert with a great computer and there is absoutely nothing i can do to make this work don t buy 
company stuck in the stone age i agree with the poster who complained about the drivers not being available for download in this day and age there is no excuse for a company not making such things available for their customers a voice recorder is tool for on the go so we should have to carry a cd with us as well in case we want to plug the recorder into a different machine this is just a case of wanton disrespect of the customer by a big company 
not the best mp player in the world i went to circuit city with my dad to buy this mp player after my older sister recieved one for christmas when i was researching the quality of this product some of the reviews were not pleasing but i m sorry to say i actually went out and bought it and i m also sorry to say this review will not be very pleasing either the exterior casing of the creative zen nano plus is merely cheap plastic flimsy and pathetic next to the ipod nano nd generation s aluminum casing scratch marks and scuff marks show up easily and i m guessing that the curved part that comes off to allow you to change the battery would also break easily if stepped on etc the positively worst part of this mp player are the earbuds which fall out if you barely touch the wiring in order to keep the earbuds in place i have to stick them into my ears at an odd angle which makes even sound level too loud to hear someone speak in an indoor voice sadly there s more the backlight doesn t stay on long enough to allow you light to see which song is playing how long it s been playing etc there is a backlight section in the settings but the longest it can stay illuminated is only seconds also when skipping tracks you use the same button to scan within a song making it much harder to scan within the song than skip tracks another disappointment is that two of the cds i tried to load onto this mp player weren t read as being there although they work fine when i listen to them on my walkman dvd player computer etc luckily i ve had this player for about nine months but it s still going strong most likely because of the fact that it runs on a single aaa battery this does get most annoying after awhile though having to change batteries every two to three weeks or whatever depending on how often you listen to this from the reviews on this site i m most likely going to purchase an ipod nano gb for my next christmas so although it s around more i m hoping it ll be worth the extra money to have an mp player i m not complaining about all the time 
do not waste your money on this piece of junk i want to give this product a zero rating ! within one month of purchase the battery lid got broken and i could not put it back i made a phone call to creative and was told that the battery was not covered in warranty the replacement would cost me plus shipping and package with totals around i argured with the csr and they just rudely hang off the phone i will never ever buy a creative product again guys if you want to waste your money and be treated rudely do not hesitate otherwise choose a more honorabl brand 
not real good install and set up was a bit confusing had to contact tech support not real friendly or warm we were looking to save time for data entry we realized with much frustration typing was faster and more accurate when scanning e mail addresses the error rate was about on a font size scanning and above error rate went down to about correcting the errors the pen made took more time then it was worth the concept is great but does need allot of improvement 
just doesn t work should have believed all the other negative reviews didn t work in my honda civic and didn t work in my nissan altima both with original manufacturer tape decks in both cases the tape deck whirred for a bit then ejected the smartdeck 
piece of this has to be absulotely the worst product i have ever used whatever you do no matter how desparate you are do not buy this product it sucks i refuse to go into detail else i get even madder than i am now belkin can kiss my posterior you the buyer please go find another product even a trained monkey 
rip off doesn t advertise that you need an ac adaptor i would like to believe that this hub works well but i wouldn t know i bought it to reduce clutter on my desk from all my devices hooking into my powermac i hooked up my printer ipod and digital camera and nothing happened i called targus and they said i needed an a c adaptor it doesn t come with one and doesn t say anything about one in the manual or instructions or their website they said i could get it at radio shack and gave me the info volt amp center positive i ve been to two radio shacks and online they don t carry it i m upset any advice 
return policy we wanted the zoom and missed the fact that this one does not have the zoom the reason i give two stars is because of beach camera s return policy they grudgingly allowed me to return it as a one time courtesy with a restocking fee i wish amazon would tag the vendors so we could easily see if we were buying from this type of company 
bugs of previous year model still present i have owned the dmr esv for over months it is a combo dvd vcr unit i have had sufficient time to become intimately familiar with the pros and cons of the unit the manual it is imperative to have the manual this machine is somewhat complicated and frequent trips to the instructions is necessary if everything is working correctly you can usually find the instructions that you need somewhere in it it is overly time consuming though since the items don t seem to logically flow if you dig long and hard enough though they are in there somewhere the set up being somewhat experienced at setting up a home theater this was generally easy the text and pictures were sufficient searching through the function menu i learned that to perform the same action and different levels required using different imput buttons this is needlessly confusing of course the auto clock set function isn t very accurate i haven t seen an accurate one yet dvd playback the general playback is pretty straight forward i really miss some of the extra playback features that are on my jvc progressive player which is years older finding a scene in a movie is comparatively difficult a zoom feature is missing many convenience features are not present dvd recording recording onto a dvd ram disc is a dream compared to old fashioned vcr tapes i really enjoy using them a quirk you must have the unit in stand by to record from the scheduler this mandates that to watch a recorded show while recording another on the same disc you must wait until the unit begins recording then select the show to watch from the navigator the uhf tuner has some trouble recording somewhat weak signals from channel other weak channels record but not this problem started about months after initial set up there is an annoying bug with daylight savings time and the newer extended time period the panasonic web site suggests going into the set up menu and unchecking the dst box thus removing the feature if this did anything it would allow you to set the clock manually being without the automatic dst adjustment would not be annoying but even though you turn off this feature it still resets your clock twice a day at noon and at pm est this ruins any tv scheduling you had set this malady persisted until the date of the former dst spring ahead arrived several weeks of scheduling hell ! i requested assistance from customer service but never received the telephone call that was promised no message no number to call just a promise to call again when i was home the vcr use this feature is really buggy you are supposed to be able to eject a cassette with the remote but this only worked for a month or two when a tv show is scheduled for recording the unit won t tape it if you merely insert a cassette it doesn t recognize the insertion of the cassette unless the tape has been made to move either playing a little or fast forwarding reversing this is really annoying last impression the last movie last king of scotland i watched took over the machine the remote control would not function the disc would not stop and the disc could not be ejected it was necessary to unplug the unit restart it eject the disc and totally reset all menu items which were randomly reset to various settings worse some settings are no longer selectable one other movie would not even play in the machine forcing me to use the trusty jvc unit i must say that this machine has many of the same problems that are still occurring in the new units from what i read at this forum and other ones these units are being released for sale way before they are ready for public consumption i recommend looking elsewhere 
not for use on treadmill i bought these headphones to watch tv while on the treadmill they don t work at all for that purpose interference from the motor causes them to cut out they work great when i stop the treadmill 
unacceptable this model was intended as a replacement for my not veryold and yet quite functional panasonic pm series stereo this is the kind of thing that happens when you browse amazon while drunk late at night unfortunately with the exception of a very slight advantage in audio quality the sony is in all respects inferior ergonomics appearance and above all fm reception which is laughably poor do not buy this stereo if you expect a quality receiver hiss abounds several local stations i heard previously are now unreachable and to top it off sony has stuck with their time honored habit of using proprietary connectors so when i went to plug in an after market antenna to get better reception i found a weird little plug that i hadn t noticed when i put the damned thing together grrr so now i m going to sell this thing and buy a nice new panasonic with the proceeds death to sony 
great sound this unit has great sound and is well worth the price i had no issues setting it up or programming it connected to all my devices with no issue 
shipping and handling the chare for shipping and handling of this small item was ridiculous ! i would have been better off buying at a retail store 
not worth getting unless they fix the software first this is for a powermac g or so the label says i haven t tried this on older g computers so i don t know if this really needs a driver that s built in a g or something i got this for the heck of checking what it can do for me nothing really first of you have to know that this adapter connects to the dvi port not the old adc port what this means is that the aluminum displays for the g model use dvi this being the case then you have a problem right there to fight over the port unless you have the high end optional nvidia gt card with dual dvi port then the stock ati cards come with one dvi and one adc so i would think people with g have or are thinking of upgrading to the aluminum display then you will be needing an adc to dvi converter to hold the monitor and tv at the same time that makes using the two monitors with respective adaptors why unless apple envisioned phasing out the adc port soon it makes no sense and if they did envision to phase out the adc then why release cards with the g that still have an adc port if the new monitors use dvi and this adapter also uses dvi are they trying to make money selling adapters i haven t seen a perfect computer to tv interface from major video card manufacturers the same way matrox has perfected it what matrox has done for dual monitors with one using a tv is that it automatically routes the video signal to the tv if it detects your playing a movie file it just brings it out to the tv as a full screen no need to drag your windows into that screen and then making it into full screen this adapter and the software interface doesn t do it it just makes your tv into another monitor with extremely low resolution naturally the point of adding a tv as a monitor is to obviously put make multimedia viewing experience more enjoyable and hassle free if you play a quicktime file or a dvd movie in your computer you would want it to be played on your tv nope not here you will have to drag it then make it full screen but it doesn t stop there try opening another application and that full screen on the tv monitors automatically switches back into one within a window very stupid and annoying so i believe they should follow the footsteps of matrox and create a custom software that will allow to do just that put a check box if you want your video automatically output on the tv on a window in the first monitor second monitor etc the above suggestion actually works with final cut pro application but if you re a video editor you really wont even need this you see once you connect your tv via this adapter then you can route your tv as your monitor which is good to check the actual picture quality on a tv screen it is a cheap solution however if you are editing on final cut pro then it would be natural that you have either a video editing card that can output to a tv monitor while keeping your dual computer monitor active for editing or you have a camcorder with firewire output or some other similar solution that you can use to route from the computer to camcorder to tv using firewire is actually a better solution that this adapter because it does not allocate video card memory to the tv via the adapter by using the adapter to connect to the tv you are eating up video memory between the computer monitor and the tv so if you have mb memory then mb goes to each this slows down the video information and will be evident if you are using big computer screens by using firewire the video card does not interfere and allocates full memory to your computer monitor the os isn t even perfect with interfacing to the adapter you connect the adapter and you ll need to constantly restart the computer whenever you connect disconnect it simply putting the computer to sleep and waking it won t work your video card still thinks the tv is connected despite having no tv nor adapter after waking from sleep shut down the computer remove the adapter then start to make sure all video card memory is allocated back to your computer monitor so unless you have a high end video card that can afford to split the memory and an interface that automatically routes the video signal to your tv this is pretty useless it s just for fun to prove that you can output part of your screen to your tv with hassle and all skip until they improve the software 
very disappointing product this product looks and feels very flimsy do not be fooled by the flashy metallic looking picture the plastic shell of this device is the quality of mcdonald s toys one would think that for the company would at least commission a manufacturer that did not leave plastic whiskers hanging off the rims due to bad cutting the buttons are hard to press in order to turn the device on you have to press very firmly which is a risky thing to do considering the cracking delicacy of the shell the cable port for the docupen is also extremely flimsy and you have to hold the cable firmly in place in order for the downloads to take place otherwise the connection will be lost i am a pre medical student and i very stupidly invested a lot of money in this product believing that i could for seconds a page and pages per disk scan my science textbooks in the library including the colored diagrams and in that way i thought i would make back my investment since textbooks go for at least each however i now see that this belief was naive to say the least the docupen is extremely difficult to use the words come out distorted like a jammed fax machine and although the free paper port software which comes complimentary with the docupen is rather useful for annotating pdf s the docupen does not produce texts that are legible enough to annotate furthermore downloading is very slow at least seconds per page on my fast computer and since you can t see how your scans have turned out until you load them into the computer you will have to re scan about of pages due to stretches smudges blurriness suspicious blank spots and general illegibility i wish i had read some of the other negative amazon reviews before buying this product i would have saved myself a lot of money and time if you are a user who is only looking to scan pictures or a few flat documents then this product may work okay for you although a digital camera will probably deliver better results if you have been harboring grandiose visions of going all out paperless with this product you will find yourself extremely disappointed until planon decides that this product is worthy enough to invest in a semi decent shell manufacturuer it will not a good buy the idea is wonderful and has a lot of potential especially when coupled with a tablet pc however the execution of the idea needs improvement i hope to see a far better version of this product in the next few years at a price that is comparable to quality 
typical monster cable rip off despite all the bad reviews i read for various monster cable products i bought one of these cables what a mistake the rca plug flanges kept working loose shortly after purchase the first time i tried to gently squeeze them back together one broke only to reveal the cheap metal used in the connector now it s loose all the time so i m replacing it with a belkin av cable available right here at amazon for about the price of monster thankfully i chose other brands for all my other home theater cables digital coax optical speaker avoid all monster cables all overpriced all mediocre quality do your research you ll see i m not alone 
disappointed i was hoping to give this to my husband for father s day it would have been great for the many power outages we have much to my dismay not one channel came in so back it went we do live in a suburban area maybe a city would pick up some sort of reception 
do not order from ritz camera wrong item do not order this item and expect to get what you see i ordered the super high speed card rpsdhgua and what i got was a low quality high speed card rpsdkgua seems to be some kind of a scam that ritz is running with amazon s blessing buyer beware this has happened to me before when you order from one of amazon s partners and amazon will do nothing to help you 
decks don t like it i ve tried this tape on three different makes of vhs decks and they all reject it check your manual about cleaning before purchasing a cleaning tape 
missing part when i received my cobra nav system the cord to use it was missing and i have had to call three times and still nhave not received the cord i contacted cobra but i think it came from target co 
not compatible these discs do not work with my canon camcorder i think the label should inform people they may not be compatible with certain devices 
it only made things worse i tried this product on two dvds that would no longer play reliably the scratches were minor and only in one part of each disc after liberally spraying the lubricant and running each through the machine twice then buffing just as the directions suggest neither disc would load in the dvd player at all i will be returning this product immediately and will advise anyone i can to avoid it 
sony stops operating next year this unit looks nice and plays nice until it doesn t anymore this piece of crap worked for only months and was turned on about x only as it stood in my bedroom where i only seldom listen to music it went dead all of a sudden and sony doesn t honor the limited warranty ! apparently what i have a short circuit that prevents me from turning the unit on is a common defect and it s even mentioned in the owner s manual ie if you get standy flashing you re in trouble ! i had several bad experiences with sony this will be my last my advice is stay with panasonics they re way way way better 
thinking different is cool apple ipod is not i sincerely hope ipods have improved i bought a g ipod photo a little over a year ago and was on my second replacement when just recently outside the warranty which of course goes from original purchase date not replacement date it s kaput again now if i have to pay for apple to fix or replace a three month old player ! no way three players on the blink each after a few months that isn t just bad luck that isn t even mentioning the difficulties with the itunes software or if you change computers i get a new pc and have to re transfer s of cds ! how lame that negates all the convenience of the large capacity i wish other mp players had the storage space the ipods have i just can t justify spending more money to replace this limited inferior pos again so essentially over the last year i have spent about a day to have a player and now i m left with nothing i will be buying a different player i will spend far less than and get something that will last more than three months is compatible with the rest of the players in the world and is easy and convenient to load and use obviously not an ipod ! unfortunately i can t transfer the music i spend hours and hours loading up over and over what a waste of money and time 
the absolute in wireless garbage when we brought this home and took it out of the box we were rather impressed with the sleek design and the cisco label when we got it all hooked up all our dreams of surfing the internet at the speed of light turned into nightmares with constant connection drops and no tech support if you read the boards on the linksys site you ll see that there are no end of connection failures across many different isp s and areas of the us since this item has been released please don t waste your money on this worthless hunk of garbage you ll end up sucking down bottles of ibuprofen and a pack of your choice before the night is even through 
don t buy until you read this i purchased this unit shortly before last christmas initially the unit worked fine and the sound was acceptable within a month the unit would play the i pod but there would be no sound coming out of the speakers when i visited the klipsch website to see about warranty information i saw numerous complaints about the same problem apparently there is an undisclosed defect with this model just check to see how many refurbished units they have for sale on the web i still have not heard back from klipsch regarding fixing or replacing the unit since i have little or no hope of hearing back from klipsch i have purchased the bose unit and want to tell you that it blows the klipsch unit away in the sound department bose knows what they are doing when it comes producing big sounds from small spaces hope this helps 
for os x a uselessly slow hard drive i use this thing with a macbook pro actually i don t use it my plan was to keep all of my itunes music and movies on it but whether i use wireless or a ft ethernet cable it s unusably slow itunes takes forever to start and keeps losing its library and movies and tv shows play choppily unless i use the ethernet cable i also tried making backups with superduper after hours a tiny fraction had been backed up so i ve given up i use a firewire hard drive for my bootable superduper backups and a small usb g fantom drive for itunes the hp mediavault a paperweight maybe it works well on a pc it doesn t with parallels i don t know 
bad choice i bought this mp player because it was just a few bucks cheaper than the ipod and i ended up paying dearly for it it is a piece of junk that stopped working only after a couple months the firmware decided to stop recognizing songs albums titles and eventually that there was even any music to listen to now i have a dollar mp player with no music on it that will not interface with my pc customer service don t count on it so if your into extensively troubleshooting highly frustrating pieces of junk this is a great product 
sound good wires weak i loved these earbuds for weeks right up until they stopped working the wires to the ipod the stationary wires not the ones that wind up disconnected or broke inside the retractable casing for a while it worked if i taped the cord so it pushed the wires into the case but quickly stopped working altogether too bad they re comfortable the sound is fine great on the bus and the retraction works good 
scans well hard to use images afterwards i am glad i purchased my cardscan but there are some significant unfortunate missed opportunities and because of that some important functions cannot be done at all my impression is that this is the best product on the market due to its scanning properties which are quite good there are some serious deficiencies though in the rest of the software which would be nice to have fixed and which in some cases render the device somewhat useless since the output cannot be transferred to a useful place pros it does a pretty good job of scanning the algorithm is well developed and is actually quite impressive even cards that catch and rotate as they go through producing a funny smeared image have some of their contents scanned correctly the superiority of this recognition software is the strong point of this product there is also an ok database management product that one can use to maintain and look up cards operationally the product is especially nice i can just sit there feeding cards in and typing carriage return after each one glancing at the screen to catch errors the card image is retained in the record in the cardscan database which is important cons the exit path has places that cards can hang up and they can catch as they go through this happens fairly often unless the card is new and flat so part of the operation is to try to prevent that by straightening out bent corners ahead of time and by adding a little force keep the card from catching and rotating as one corner goes forward and the other is stuck quite needless if the exit path was smooth and continuous this wouldn t happen the problem is in the rear of the plastic case although the product retains the image of the business card there s no way to pass that through to outlook or export it to any other format this is very unfortunate i could laboriously do that by hand by cutting and pasting each one except that cardscan software does not permit copy paste functions on the image why not it s easy to implement every time i start the program it harasses me about registering even though i ve been specific that i do not wish to it also harasses me about logging in the online backup facility even though i ve asked it not to do that it therefore ignores the user wishes the data exchange function allows only extremely crude export to a file in a simple text or csv format there is no way to create an outlook format pst file which would simplify importing and allow for the future option of including an image outlook can hold an image in the comment section of the record but apparently cardscan folks aren t even close to thinking about this if i indicate that a data export for a file is destined for outlook the field names are not set up correctly so unless i do some heavy editing of field names nothing much other than the contact name gets across if i export directly to the running outlook program it isn t perfect but it s close enough to be usable why did cardscan get one right and not the other in neither case can i send the card image over i was forced to install microsoft net software even though i intended to do all my exports via files i didn t get a choice if i didn t install net the installer stopped and exited without installing any cardscan software 
poor device this unit is not worth the money unfortunately i gave this unit as a gift to my mom helping her set this item up was a nightmare the unit itself is gorgous and the keys are beatifully back lit however the software included is a bit confusing does not find addresses too well and to top it off the unit is extremely extremely slow the processor can not keep up with input selections as well as recalculations of routes warm up time is deplorable and as other reviewers have noted can take up to minutes to find your position i have used a garmin c and this unit while more expensive is far superior to this unit all in all even though the price of this unit is very very tempting save your money and purchase something else this unit is obsolete and can not handle normal day to day operations 
do not buy i wish i had read the problems and netgear com forums before purchasing this product huge flaw in this product requires that it be restarted daily this requires you unplug and plug back in the ap in order for it to stay visable to your computers second problem i am noticing is that the mbps speeds are very rare and even at feet from the ap the unit is around mpbsdo not buy this product find another company who stands behind there products all of my contacts with them have landed me somewhere in india people on the phone dont know how to help you and email support is a joke latest firmware fixes none of the problems 
sucks bought new around cd player and lcd clock stopped working within months now nap function and radio are all that works if only i could find the damn receipt 
inability to fax multiple pages if you like a machine pulling multiple pages through at one time and being forced to feed each page before it shuts off then this is the machine for you 
overpriced the batteries were priced higher than my local supermarket and i foolishly thought the shipping would be a couple of dollars i paid dollars for batteries that would have cost a few blocks away from my home check the shipping on your items nothing wrong with the batteries never shop in a rush 
absolute garbage seldom do i find a product that is so bad that i only use it once unfortunately i bought it for an international trip and the return period was over when i got back i offered to give it to the store to demo so that no one else would buy them don t waste your money 
overpriced underperformance i have owned many radios and purchased this received short wave stations and to get better reception for local stations this radio did neither this radio performed worse than a cheapy radio which received station more easily and much clearer i returned this radio shortly after trying it what a waste ! do not buy this piece of junk 
very very unhappy my daughter bought this for me so i could see my grand children who live in other states i have spent days and almost trying to get it to work i even hired a computer repairman who charged me and could not get it working if it was not a gift i would send it back to get my money back i called the help line lots of times and usually got someone who didn t speak english very well they would end up telling me it was a problem with the router then i would call the router and they would tell me it is a problem with the d link no one wants to take responsibility for getting it working i even went on the support page on the internet and read pages of things that could be wrong tried them all in six days and i still don t have it working and has cost me alot of time and money good luck if you buy it you will need it 
cute but on a short leash i just drove miles round trip to buy this mouse from a brick and mortar store because i wasn t sure about the size for people with small hands a regular mouse is ergonomically uncomfortable and it is sometimes hard to find a small size mouse the grip is great and the feel is fine this is one of a very few mouses labelled as vista compatible so the choices are limited for a laptop pc this mouse is probably ok but the usb cord is less than feet long thus if you re using a big new microsoft ergonomic keyboard which has no onboard usb port and a full pc this mouse is not suitable i suppose one could place the pc on the desktop but that s an irrational use of space but its probably the better plan than moving your desk so the pc is within feet of your right hand i preferred the off brand micro innovations travel mouse with its longer foot cord but my new microsoft office software queers it off although my old xp software on an earlier computer didn t and that is why i bought this one microsoft should redo excel add a generous mouse cord to this model add a usb port to its keyboard and certify other companies mice so folks know what will work as it is consumers are locked into a somewhat disfunctional set of conundrums 
not worth the trouble or money this product is not worth the money or trouble i also had problem with bubbles forming and also the sides curing up as my notebook warmed up it was too much bother to keep trying to smooth out the bubbles and press down the sides after curling back up save your money and don t buy this this would actually qualify for a zero star rating 
sorry didn t do the job for me i ve given it stars instead of because after i used this cd the sound from my system did seem to be a little better the cd s were not skipping as much but the bottom line is it didn t fix the problem as the cds are still skipping noticeably although not as bad as before not sure if this has anything to do with the fact that my set has a disk cd changer 
sucks it gets stuck just when you need a disk stay away from this device missed ejected disk references you will feel really pissed off in front of a such piece of junk with no way to get your disks a hammer is an smart option as a recovery tool 
beware samsung dlp design flaws consumers should be aware of serious design flaws which exist in samsung dlp televisions cooling fans and color wheels are highly susceptible to failing as a non techniocal person i should have no idea what these parts are but alas i bought a samsung dlp expect these to fail within years expect to pay approx to replace the color wheel and to replace the colling fan that is if your service technician can find them in stock anywhere these parts are commonly in a national backorder because of the very high failure rates you should also expect the lamp to fail sooner than advertized many people need to purchase a new lamp between years and some more often than that the lamp costs approx depending on your model but you should be able to replace it yourself without too much difficulty this cost will be in addition to replacement costs for the color wheel and colling fan please remember that these maintenance costs are recurring and you will have to fix them again in another years while i was very satisfied with the quality and performance of my dlp my color wheel failed very early i called tech support to report a grinding noise and was told to turn it off wait minutes and turn it back on like this would fix the problem after doing this for a while the color wheel finally failed actually shattered ! now i am out of warranty and samsung wants nothing to do with me i have even tried ordering the part myself from two different online vendors and they are both backordered indefinitely ! it has been weeks and they have no estimate for when this part will be available samsung cannot even give me an estimate when the supply of replacement parts is expected to meet demand i have had my tv for months and apparently there is a national epidemic of them breaking at the same time i have a samsung plasma which is a beautiful set along with a crt both are wonderful products but samsung is selling dlp lemons and will not stand behind them dlp is a great bargain up front but a maintenance nightmare ! you will pay in the long run and by the long run i mean every years if you still want to purchase a dlp television please buy the extended warranty ! it will save you a ton but you will still have to wait for the circuit city tech to find parts which may take months i expect samsung to abandon their design flaw riddled dlp sector and focus on their beautiful plasma line expect dlp prices to drop even further but please look before you leap 
oh where oh where could it be ordered on the th of august hasn t even shipped yet 
unreliable poor online support expensive doesn t work shame on you belkin why does this product have so many flaws firstly the missing keystrokes causing you to send emails with missing characters meaning you have to spell check everything even if your spelling is perfect but you still send an instead of and arghhon one of the pcs i am using on boot up the keyboard never works i have to go into the device manager for that pc to uninstall the driver that is not functioning properly and reinstall it and if the pc gods are looking down favourably on me the keyboard starts to work otherwise i have to resort to other methods to breath life into the dang thing the firmware upgrade i thought ok maybe this could solve all my problems but using a parallel cable both of my pcs don t have a parallel port ! why not use a usb connection arrgghh if you are thinking of buying a port switch box do what i am going to have to do look elsewhere 
buyer beware i was so excited for this unit only to find that it wasn t the quality i expected first the fm transmitter only works in the car dock not included so if you want to use it at home make sure your stereo has audio jacks or an aux jack second the product was defective my songs on the mp repeat sometimes and the headphone jack is faulty causing the sound to cut out and sound bad unless you hold the cord into the unit this happens with both the mp and the xm sat radio so i know it isn t reception samsung offered to repare it but the tech support is awful and unknowledgable we ll see what happens 
bad experience product needed to be returned the transmitter is very poor and even after turning up my car stereo volume all the way i could barely even hear the music i thought it might be something i was doing but after checking all the settting it turns out it s just a poor product i had my mp player volume turned up the transmitter was powered up the transmitter and my car stereo were tuned to the same frequency and the frequency i was using doesn t have a radio station on it still nothing ! i would be careful ordering this product maybe the one i received just had problems but it doesn t appear that i m the only one experiencing these problems after reading other reviews 
disappointed in lexmark p i was very disappointed in the lexmark p printer the colors were very dull and the picture quality were definitely not up to the lexmark standards that i am used to i have several lexmark products i returned the printer 
did not work with car stereo i received this item and thought that the price was great considering the reviews from others unfortunately the avb cassette adapter did not work with the cassette player on my car stereo in case this is of any help it was a stock pioneer head unit on a lexus sc it might just be that i received a defective adapter or it is not compatible with my car either way the car never recognized it after trying multiple times it kept making a noise that sounded like it was spinning and even if it had read the adapter the noise coming from it was too loud to hear the music over it i ended up returning it and purchasing a dynex dx ca and that one worked fine and worked quietly 
problems from the beginning i bought this device because i loved that i could use it for both work and personal fun i bought it in september and by january i d returned it because the blue paint was peeling off palm was pretty awful to deal with it was returned to me in april or may when they did return the device it would not sync properly i called palm and they gave me the run around telling me it was my pcs problem my company s problem etc they wouldn t take it back then the warranty expired and they wouldn t take it back and quite frankly i was exhausted by the whole thing and stopped using it for a couple of months finally in january i decided just to use it for its organizational tasks and forget the syncking now june that just broke and i am throwing it away 
duhh ! why print x when it is x this makes no sense if the industry standard is x why did they kodak cut the paper to x and then advertise on the carton that it is x yes i see the fine print on the back side of the carton that reads actual paper size is x i still don t understand why they did this now i have cut the pictures down to the correct size what a waste of my time 
beware of kingston rebates beware of kingston rebates of course i hope your experience would differ if you were to buy kingston product s but mine was terrible i bought a kingston compactflash card that offered a mail in rebate i promptly as in the day after i received the item delivery went to photocopy my rebate certificate and upc code and sales receipt then sent it all on its merry way yes i was well within the rebate period both for the purchase and for the postmark date my purchase was a valid retailer think huge online e tailerthe rebate required sending the entire original upc label which was like the entire outside package for my cf card about the size of  business cards when flattened no problem about two months later i get a letter saying your rebate request was denied because you failed to furnish the appropriate original upc code as required by the rebate offer well now what i can t re send the original it was already in their possession i called and they insisted on repeating what the letter said i re sent my photocopies and they said a photocopy is invalid proof of purchase after another weeks of pursuing this i figured this is their scam they simply wouldn t honor the rebate and without the original upc in my possession i couldn t really submit to their requirements if you re looking for a ram upgrade i d suggest you look at a quality company like ocz the best ! or patriot geil or corsair if you re looking for a value flash memory card i might suggest sandisk for one kingston does not make the best products they are value driven products two there are competitors to kingston with just as good or better value toperformance ratios at the same prices three kingston will not stand behind their customer as i have experienced i urge you to please be cautious of kingston and their rebate scams 
which ipod do you have how to pick the iskin i have now been shipped two iskins for my gig and both of them had the holes in the top in the wrong place there are at least three flavors of gig ipods in the marketplace at present and more coming it appears so be careful which one you order the manufacturer s website is very confusing and unhelpful about identifying the correct model of skin even if you know the model number of your ipod i also agree with the other reviewer that the belt clip is a mistake throw it away 
unmet expectations seemed to be just what i was looking for but that was not reality while the unit looks nice and had a good price for use a low volumes in a room setting it just did not but it it had a constant hum when music was not play the remote was difficult to change the settings the sound waulity at low volumes was poor and had little base the knob on the front were difficult to spin as they are flush to the face in an outdoor setting this may work as intended but it was not what i needed the blue light lcd is very bright in a dark room also be careful of the return policy and don t expect any reply to e mails maybe my unit was defective but i will never know 
arrived doa this phone arrived doa and there is no way i could use it as usual you get what you pay for 
it s okay alright first off this piece of crap will randomly stop playing it started off when i d just walk around that it would turn off but now sometimes i barely touch it and tilt it to the side to look at the song and it turns off it is not easy to use if you re a hold button person if you have it on hold while plugged into your computer it will not let you delete or add music which made me panick at first and fear for a permanant playlist also the headphones that come with it are really not worth it they are really really bad so go buy some nice sony ones and the song switcher thinger is a little defective it s neat but you can push it down and it ll hit something inside of the mp player that makes the songs skip and be all crazy so it gives me a fear of damaging the insides of my mp player whenever its in my pocket or something i think thats about it i wouldn t recommend it unless you want a cheap piece of s 
wouldn t work on my computer the hook up and downloading the software was very simple there was a error problem with the drivers my computer is fairly new with windows xp i called there support and was told to try it on another computer i install it on my neighbors computer and the same happened i sent it back to amazon and credit my account and bought an other brand amazon is so great about handling returns 
not loud enough for a shop phone i got one of these the sears craftsman version as a gift so the price was right otherwise i d say it s overpriced the maximum volume is much too low to be used in a noisy environment the handset is thick so if you hang it from your belt upside down because of how the belt clip is attached then you re going to scrape it off and have it fall to the floor the keypad numbers are sealed but the buttons themselves are very small if this is really a shop phone then why isn t there some sort of bright flashing light that lets you know visually when a call is coming in if you re wearing ear plugs or running a noisy tool you ll never hear the ring i haven t found the extra battery to be necessary or usefull i think it s just a gimmick to appeal to the quotcordless tool quot crowd i m sure that the quotsparequot battery won t last any longer than the one you leave permanently attached to the phone one supposed selling point for this phone is that you can put in a garage or shop where you have no phone line installed you can do this because it comes with a transmitter receiver unit that you can plug in anywhere in the house there s a phone jack don t try to use this phone very far from the trans receiver unit because its range is pretty low im giving this phone only one star because it has some useless features is missing several other necessary features costs too much for what you get and doesn t perform very well especially considering it s billed as a specialized shop phone 
broken after one week i owned this product for about one week very nice little piece which i can take to work or jogging but today when i am copying some files to it from my computer it stopped working even reset didn t work so i will return it for a refund and try different products 
shipping and handling you charge too much for shipping and handling i would have been better off going to a retail store 
the easier way to do it i mean seriously guys is it really worth forking over to those greedy peeps at sony over dollars just for a silly memory card there is an easier way to do it ya know for your psp if the game is really important to you and you can t save it just press up on the power switch real quick the screen will go off it will go on hold and next time you wanna play it again just push it back up and hopefully if you did it right you ll have the game right back in the place you left it hey it saved me dollars and it can do the same thing for yo 
what a total marketing rip off bought a no name subwoofer cable off ebay took it over to my friend s house he owns this monster cable we switched back and forth between the no name shipped and this one and guess how much of a difference the monster cable made zip zero nada thhhhhhpt god bless ebay and god help all the suckers who buy all the monster cable advertising hype 
look for other alternatives i bought four of these and returned them immediately two were dead out of the box a third had horrible sound after searching the internet and reading a variety of reviews for similar products i finally settled on the megahertz wireless intercom from radio shack beautiful sound well made and about half the price of the reporter pretty much the same featues but it only claims a range of feet as opposed to feet so if you need more than feet for range it s something to consider better warranty than the reporter as well and for bucks you can extend that warrarnty for another year anyway i couldn t be happier with the rs intercom i just can t recommend the reporters given that out of units that arrived were faulty 
twin pack is overpriced the price for the twinpack is more than twice the price of two single packs each x buy two of the singles not the twin pack 
worthless zero stars is more like it no matter what i did in the way of configuration it would not work i have wasted nearly a week of my time trying to get this piece of junk to hold a configuration to no avail finally my frustration with it grew so intense that i took it to my garage and fixed it with a mallet i can assure you it will not be giving anyone else problems avoid at all costs 
this backpack didn t hold up pro sits really roomy ample room for my old brick of a computer dell inspiron and my tiny hp nc good sized for overnight consno compression straps when you have a smaller load to carry i ended up ripping the nylon on the bag accidently as it got hooked on the side of a gym locker not as good as ripstop nylon the zipper teeths aren t secure strong enough the bag would separate at the zippers numerous times eventually the zippers all broke loose in one night even the separate zipper for the laptop 
not for ski trip i got them mostly for being very light and small in the city it worked up to of a mile you can connect a bit more but hear only static on a ski resort it only worked within the same building lodge you cannot connect to another radio even on the same side of the mountain i d return them but as they are so small and sleek we lost one on the second day 
bad disc error possible fix bad disc error possible fixafter about months just like the other reviewer it stopped working i kept getting bad disc error on a new dvd i bought i tried good discs that worked before but now got the same bad disc error this is not the first time i had problems loading previously unplugging and plugging it in again sometimes corrected the problem this time after two weeks of bad disc errors i was about to toss it when i decided what the heck i ll check inside to see if it s dirty or something first i unplugged the unit i removed the screws holding the cover you may have to pull the sides out a bit if it catches to lift it off with my expertise knowledge eyeroll i nudged the lense mechanism it apparently slides to read the discs i plugged the dvd in and loaded a disc again to see what happens the lense slid under the tray and started reading the disc i ll take the elation of dumb luck over the satisfaction calculated knowledge any day ! lolso hopefully this will last a little longer but at least i can use it again for now i am downrating it to stars solely on the bad disc error the viewing quality and performance is decent and covered by other reviewers 
don t buy or you will regret i do not leave feedback of any kind on amazon com but this time as i was listening to my car audio today i was compelled to leave one for others this product is probably the worst of any electrical equipments i bought for mp player audio system its sound reproducing transmission from mp player to car audio is of inferior quality it does not balance well the low high frequency sounds resulting in dampened sound with absolutely no clarity mine worked ok for the first several hours i assume i think it damaged the speaker and it now sounds like it s going to rip apart someone else left review explaing this trouble which i ignored which was a mistake again don t buy 
beware there has been a mix up here the item pictured here is not the coby tf dvd the spec s given here do not match the spec s and capabilities of this item the spec s given here do not even match the tf dvd ! here s what you are looking at the coby tf dvd for spec s go to coby com this device has a inch screen it does not have two headphone jacks or two sets of headphones it will not display jpeg images from a disc it does not have a zoom function in the playback mode amazon has been notified but is not taking responsibility for the mix up techdepot the amazon partnet actually delivering this product has been notified but is not taking responsibility for the mix up techdepot will take the item back no problem but if you wanted the item described they won t have it as far as i can tell nobody has it the closest thing out there is the coby tf dvd which has a inch screen looks like the one pictured here and matches the description here except that it doesn t have two headphone jacks i don t know where that came from ! hope this saves you some aggravation 
did not get it in the mail yet i have been charged however i did not get a copy of the policy to date 
broken within hours junk i ordered this item after reading the positive reviews here big mistake upon setting everything up it all worked great for about two hours then the dreaded unplugprotect screen came up now it won t turn on but for a few moments before returning to protect mode and no it s not a short in the wires or overheating it protects even when stone cold and with no speakers plugged in i called sony and they say it is a short in the box so now my two options are to unhook everything repack exactly the way it came to me and reship back to the online store i bought it from with enormous hastle and expense or take the receiver in to a sony authorized service center which happens to be across town and only open monday friday pm so much for being convenient this thing is brand new and already needs repairs ! on top of that even out of the box none of the video inputs worked audio was fine but video was dead as a doornail right from the start and even on top of the fact that this machine came broken it sucks even when it works right ! the dvds take forever to load and it comes with hdmi out but no hdmi in ! so if you re an hdmi user i hope you have multiple hdmi inputs on your television one for your cable box one for this crappy system this is a piece of junk for the love of god don t waste your money 
died suddenly repair impractical lost my stuff one day it just stopped working i got the dreaded orange and green flashing lights of death the contents of the file space were un recoverable and i ended up just pitching it after extensive attempts to revive it apparently this is yet another one of the bad products that apple likes to keep hush hush 
cheap hunk of junk this was the worst purchase of any type of computer hardware that i have ever made it felt very light and flimsy the definition of cheap plastic not just the construction but the performance was terrible it would work perfectly for about a half hour and then go on a break and do nothing for about minutes this was very very frustrating maybe i was just unlucky and received a defective one but i wouldn t take that chance again i wish i could give this device a worse rating somewhere around would be much more appropriate 
broke easily the usb plug broke very easily and threw it away after only two uses i would instead recommend buying a car charger with a usb port so that you can charge with the usb cable as you would on a computer 
overpriced and unsupported i bought the explorist which i am generally happy with but this software is lousy and there is no product support for it on the website the version i have has not been updated to work well with the explorist and the mb limitation is a pain when you have a mb sd card in general the routing works but the interface is nowhere near as good as streets and trips 
unable to install despite reaching d link technical support from looking at the d link website and talking to five tech support staff it appears that there are countless versions of this card each with different driver software the one i got came with a cd with the wrong drivers with tech support i finally found the mb driver file i was supposed to download however they did not provide any instructions on how to install the new driver the normal automatic approach did not work and their instructions did not match the screens i was getting on windows xp sp so i called back again and again and again despite being given a case file each time i was asked the same questions including what exactly is wrong and each time i was told to do the same thing install from the cd reboot remove the program reboot install from the new driver reboot remove the program talk to a senior tech support person install from cd reboot etc it would have been easier to send the card with the right files on the cd a clearly designed website would be second best and tech support that knows what they re doing and speaks intelligble english would be a nice last resort i spent three hours calling d link technical support and speaking to five people and they could not tell me how to install the software for this card i am not alone in this experience see cnet s web site user reviews of the dwl ganother reviewer reports that this software damaged his operating system i believe he is right it appears to have damaged my screen font for windows message boxes i have been unable to repair it the dwl g is bad news i give them two stars cause they actually have tech support though in this case it was utterly worthless back it goes 
dvd is disappointment lcd does its job we bought ours from amazon in october and have been disappointed with the dvd player which has a flaw documented in the manual that more than outweighs any convenience provided by the built in player unfortunately we got to the point where the dvd player could not play any dvd s every dvd inserted produced a message disc not available i tried netflix dvd s then retail dvd s from my library then opened some dvd s still in shrinkwrap and they would not play it was not a problem with dvd scratches or failing to put the dvd s in the right way i called toshiba support and they recommended a cure that sounded incredulous according to the manual static electricity can build up in the dvd player forcing you to physically unplug the regza for a few minutes to dissipate the charge of course to reduce cable clutter the regza is plugged into a receptacle in an out of the way place but to meet the requirements of the manual that should be accessible the plug going into the back of the regza is not even designed so it could be unplugged there it has to be unplugged at the receptacle and it is not even a grounded power cord which an electrical engineer i talked to about this said could contribute to the problem in the first place after the aforementioned hard reboot of the regza it resumed playing retail dvd s again unfortunately the dvd player is not of high enough quality to play any of the dvd r and dvd r media i ve tried so far tdk memorex office depot maxell which were burned with a sony dvdirect vrd mc these same dvd s play in my computer dvd drive and with my pioneer dvd player in another room on the plus side we ve been happy with the images we get and haven t noticed some of the lcd artifacts we observe on our smaller sony wega tv we watch a lot of hd through cable and the display is crisp we use the hdmi connector and haven t used any of the computer network functions of the monitor so we can t comment on them the only minor comment about the display itself is that we use this in a room that is very bright during the day and very dark at night so i only wish it had greater range on the low side for its backlight setting if toshiba can come up with a design that doesn t require periodic unplugging and can play a more robust range of dvd media i could recommend it as built today i do not feel the integrated dvd is worth recommending this model 
most difficult piece of hardware to install i agree with most of the reviews regarding the difficulting in installing this wireless access point i am no it expert but have quite a bit of experience in installing and administering networking equipment in a large corporate environment i was able to get a connection without any encryption but could not get the device to work with wep or wpa i eventually had our it consultant configure the device but it took him about four hours he had previously recommended that i go with linksys but i didn t listen i regret that decision 
garmin quest ii it is small and light weight probably perfect for hikers i think the battery is supposed to last hrs away from the car the software is pretty versatile and it lets you do a lot my biggest complaint is that it is very slow i ll be typing in a name to help filter my destination choices and if it is more than miles away it takes forever for it to show up i end up not knowing if the destination say mcdonalds doesn t exist nearby or if i just spelled it wrong additionally when i pass up a turn i don t want to make it goes into recalculating then it finishes in time to tell me to turn right just as i m driving through the intersection recalculating again i think she does it on purpose this product would probably be fine for anyone who drives at half the speed limit 
i wish we could give zero stars i hooked this thing up to my dell laptop tonight so i could use my nice old keyboard on it it never worked went to amazon and read the comments seems alot of people have had the same problem aparently laptops are not the normal pc s that you might make from scratch and have custom stuff in them from dell compaq hp gateway apple ibm lenovo among others it does not work do not waste your money tell amazon to ditch this 
positively horrible don t waste your funds to say that i ve wanted to throw this smartdeck out of my car window countless times may be a strong indication of how poorly it works never have i encountered a product that works so poorly don t even consider owning this accessory if you live in an area of the country that dips below degrees it seems the product works even worse in the cold upon pluggin my ipod into the smartdeck the adapter makes my ipod jump from song to song playing the first a second of each it s rare that i m able to get the adapter to play the ipod normally i will no doubt be shopping around the competition for a stronger more reliable piece of equipment for my ipod 
failure these headphones were great at first but then failed right ear stopped working after months i sent the orginal pair back to the manufacturer for a replacement but the replacement pair also failed with the same problem after a couple more months stay away from these 
missing batteries i am also missing the batteries and the charger i tried regular aa batteries but they die really quickly and when they die the lens doesn t retract i have a feeling it is false advertizing on fujifilm s part not amazon s because other sites list this remanufactured camera as coming with the same stuff 
wont work with itunes for windows also import a cd money down the drai 
october this dvd player is potentially a great cheap and versatile machine but the two i bought from worldwide distributers were faulty i have a friend who owns a ch dvd which works perfectly with my region english dvds i have a cyberhome dvd player in england which works perfectly as well the two machine i received didnt work very well and didnt play some discs at all this is why i would recommend spending a bit more on another machine after returning two players i decided to buy a philips dvp multiformat dvd player with divx mp windows media support which with a code to allow it to play all regions works perfectly ! it cost with free shipping through amazon so wasn t actually much more expensive than the other player ! see the reviews of this player for the code ! i would also like to say that there was nothing wrong with the service from worldwide distributors and that they refunded most of the shipping costs the problem was only with the dvd players they sent me 
product advertisement deceptive i purchased this product for my business the manufacturers ad indicated that you can take notes and transfer to pc also the script is handy to convert handwriting to text it does well in converting your handwriting however if you put an x in all corners of the notebook it does not stay in the same position on the pc all of the characters shifts to the top left corner the notebook cannot distinqush spaces or null gaps on the page and the characters shifts to the left of page if you fill the whole page with characters it also to shifts to the left as well my advice just like the other reviews do not waste your money on this product amazon allowed me to return without any issues amazon is a great merchant and i will continue to buy from them thank you amazon ! 
not a true access point it is likely if you are looking at an access point rather than a basic broadband router that you are wanting more versatility in your wireless setup if this is the case this d link product is a waste of time despite being advertised as an access point ap the dwl gap is not a true ap there is no client ap mode allows the ap to be a client to another ap there is no wireless bridge mode there is no wireless repeater mode in fact everything you would expect to see on an ap is missing and d link do not seem to be able to keep track of firmware releases properly either my ap came with which according to d link does not exist as such it s virtually useless as anything other than a very basic access point buy the linksys wapg instead and get a real ap 
fuzzy sound poor quality when speaking or listening sound becomes distorted and fuzzy it is annoying to try to converse 
bad ink cartridges i ordered the combo ink cartridge package the black cartridge quit working after one page i emailed the contact person and it took almost a week before he got back to me they sent a replacement cartridge and it worked the same as the first i will not buy from them again 
it s ok nothing too special it s ok nothing too special there are better ones in the marke 
wrong product sent i did not receive the correct product that i ordered i informed the seller and he stated that i would need to resell on ebay myself very disappointed with his service kell 
non adjustable headband is uncomfortable the headband on these headphones is a fixed size so they are held in place by the pressure of the earpads against your ears they were uncomfortable after seconds so i can t imagine wearing them for any significant length of time i m not sure what they were thinking one size fits all is not a good idea for headphones 
garbage backed by a garbage company i ordered this player from fingerhut and unfortunately didn t try to use it until the time to return it had expired it has never worked for me the power stand by light comes on and stays on and that is all it does it will not play anything i tried to call the coby customer service and you never get through to anyone from what else i ve read even if you get through they will charge to replace the player which is more than the it sells for new at cvs don t buy it unless you want to be part of the class action lawsuit i m contemplating filing against them 
an absolute sham do not waste your money on this nonsense ! i want to believe that it might have been the software that was the problem but even with saying that this organizer was a total waste of money and time 
poor range i bought the c crane fm transmitter expecting to broadcast from my computer and listen to it on an fm tuner with headsets as i worked around the house and yard it broadcast or feet max out of the box i performed the power boosting fix and now it broadcasts feet if i m lucky before static overpowers the signal this was a disappointing purchase directly from c crane that in no way met my expectations if it requires setting the transmitter on a grounded metal plate and lengthening the antenna in order to bring transmission up to whole house and yard capabilities build it that way from the get go or state the limitations of this transmitter forthrightly i kept the transmitter because i wanted one for the car it s physically well built and works fine for that i also use it to play my ipod through a radio but understand the radio is sitting right next to the transmitter if you want to transmit throughout your house and yard look elsewhere 
not fully satisfied i do not do much printing but the ink ran low after a very short time it did not last as long as it normally does when i purchase it at an office supply store i wondered if it had dried out 
failure out of the box one of the two radios is not sending nor receiving everything else is working but it does not pick up a signal like if you are on a different channel i sent them back to amazon 
did not deliver i purchased for about the year replacement plan for electronics products on and after one call on about to the seller i still have not received anything john 
does not work reliably with an optical mouse i can occasionally get my logitech cordless mouseman optical mouse to work on this pad but before long it just stops tracking not surprising since the pad is a smooth solid black surface it s also quite large and rigid so i had a hard time fitting it into my desk s tray alongside my keyboard had to ditch the wrist pad and turn it sideways i ve given up on it i guess if you have the space and the right mouse it would be a nice mousepad but it was not the right purchase for me 
battery issues as all of the other posters state this controller has a serious issue with its batteries i too contacted the company and without any question they sent two replacement no qualms with that kind of service but the new batteries died just as quickly i even tried removing the back cover which was successful revealing nimh v mah batteries however the were both seated in the casing properly i may try and replace them however the bottom line is that i shouldn t have to go through all of this hassle my recommendation is to buy a wireless pc gamepad that works the first time am i not wise 
it was surprise for me before i bought this reader i considered models in lexar and sandisk i decided to buy lexar i bought this reader to use mostly with memory stick i have cards mb and gb i had no problem with mb card but i could not insert my gig card into this reader it just did not go i tried hard trying not to break the card no success it was a surprise for me may be because my card was made not by lexar by sandisk i contacted lexar but did not get any explanation of this problem any way i had to send it back and buy in sandisk reader 
very dissappointing i was excited about this product from reading previous reviews however i did not find the product satisfactory first off it s very difficult to place the ipod into the device it requires the ipod be placed in a rubberized sleeve and forced into a narrow slot it is very difficult to properly connect it or remove it when done the sound quality was much less than expected it was distorted and grainy at higher volumes the price is great which is what attracted me but if you want any quality at all you re going to have to pay more 
unit added noise to line but works like regular phone even without a land line maybe i got a defective one but there was a slight humming sound even before it dialed and no i am not talking about the dial tone the sound was more noticeable with some phones than others as some accentuated the frequency interference that this device added to the line again the problem was the device and not skype i bought an actiontec internet phone wizard instead and the noise was gone completely so maybe i did get a defective unit but either way there is probably some quality control issues with this device or maybe all of them have the noise and some people don t notice it s up to you to decide with the actiontec or dlink it will probably be much much clearer also the people posting saying you cannot dial out if you do not have a land line are completely wrong you download the latest software right click the system tray icon and choose advanced then change the default mode to usb instead of pots then you can dial by doing areacode number this will dial skype from any phone if the device didn t have that interference to it then i would have kept it as the software and functionality is very good even without a land line 
it doesn t work at all i connected all the cables as instructed but it doesn t work the light is not on so i return it to amazon 
admirable concept but shoddy manufacturing not worth the price the first product i ever bought from razer was one of their copperhead mice it was expensive but i was impressed with the overall design and quality of the product i ve had that mouse for more than a year now and haven t had any problems even with heavy use when i heard razer was branching out into pc audio i was naturally curious so i decided to pick up a pair of these headphones along with their ac sound card again they were expensive but i felt i would makeup for that in design and quality when i first opened the box i found that the cord was melted together in a few places like the wire insulator hadn t cooled properly before it was rapped together with the plastic twisty i also found that if i pulled these bonds apart they revealed the bare wire not good so i sent it back and got a replacement when i opened the second pair i found the same thing in addition to one of the fancy led lights not working luckily i was able to pull the various bonds apart without revealing any bare wire the light still doesn t work though i am to say the least disappointed with razer here i have since read other reviews about people complaining about similar issues relating to the quality of the headphones screws coming loose volume control loosing responsiveness etc gamers in particular tend to use headphones hard and don t appreciate when they break before their time if i am going to shell out that much money for headphones i would like the quality of the product to reflect the price 
blah phone i sent it back the price was right but the caller id didn t function when i got in touch with at t they told me maybe this phone is not compatible with the other phones in my home stupid response i then asked why would at t put a phone on the market that s not compatible with my other phones i didn t get a reply they wanted to send me a replacement i told them there is no point in doing that if the replacement phone was not compatible with my other phones ! i guess amazon will be sending it back to at t 
nope not for a inch notebook we ve got sony s inch vgn a series notebook and no it doesn t fit once the notebook is inserted into the carrying case it is nearly impossible to zip close my wife uses it mostly and though the case appears durable and padded getting the notebook inserted and the case zipped closed is difficult and very tight at best the case needs more room to fit most inch notebooks we feared that the notebook would get damaged while trying to zip the case closed weve owned numerous notebooks and cases over the last ten years the sony carrying case also does not carry much extra either we ve since bought another brand targus inch that fits much better and carries more items accessories this second one was essentially the same price much happier now 
disappointed to say the least i should have saved my money on this one i bought it thinking it was a belt clip carrying case my mistake if you need a protective case in the event that you drop your sansa and want to protect it well maybe you want this item but it s not very attractive and it s a shame to put the player in it because you can t access the buttons very easily definately not worth the money spent 
beware ! syntax warranty syntax clearly states that their warranty is only good for the origninal purchaser i got my daughter one as a gift gave it to her bran new in the factory sealed box and syntax refuses to honor the warranty and yes i calld everywere and tried everything 
horrible mouse i have had two of these both of them do not work the first one lasted for about half a year then broke the nd one broke the second i brought it home it was still intact but did not work at all look instead for something from logitec 
just awful after reading the reviews on here i was hesitant to use the product i had just purchased but i figured what could i lose it was already skipping and if this didn t work i d just buy a new copy well i m here to tell you that if you plan to use this on anything important forget it the cd was left with more scratches than before the protective pad actually makes scratches worse than a paper towel and it s just a horrible product i followed the directions to a t thanks maxell for wasting my money and my time 
bad compatibility i have the older larger version of this product however it uses the same software the labels are great and the spring device that is used to apply the labels is great but the software is awful there is no direct macintosh program rather there are templates they were written for old versions of software and really don t work right the windows side includes an actual print shop style program which works awfully if you do get this make your own template on appleworks or powerpoint 
this product did nothing for me i currently have computers and use a wireless router for broadband connectivity the router and the second computer are on the same floor of my home about rooms apart i was receiving a low response connectivity on this second computer so i purchased the powerline adapters i purchased adapters and installed these according to the vendor s directions based on other s glowing reviews and recommendations this product did absolutely nothing for me my poor response connectivity was the same either with or without the netgear adapter so it was very disappointing 
don t waste your time the only possible attraction to this gizmo is the price with that said it is still over priced i purchased my coby player from a local sporting goods store because i didn t want to pay a lot for a new mp player i just had a really good one that i spent maybe dollars for stolen and when i went to buy a new one they were priced around and up i went with this cheapo item and paid about hoping that if i lose it or get it stolen again it wouldn t be a big deal now i m begging someone please take it i used it for a few days and did not like the difficult screen menus you have to scroll with a toggle switch several times just to get to a menu that enables you to play music the toggling is not intuitive and you have to jar it several times before it actually moves once the view is less that an inch tall and so you really can t see what your playing long story short before anyone got a chance to steal this one it stopped working completely in a couple of weeks i just took it back to the store for a refund of my money it is well worth it to spend another or dollars and get a decent mp player 
junk no matter how you hold this you will accidentilly press a button in addition the menu is lousy for instance one screen has options route yes no i still haven t memorized what to press to get back to my original route it is not route there is no home if you look up any thing for instance the nearest rest area you lose your original route and have to start again i went to the web site expecting to download the latest updates changed roads new restaurants etc but i don t think you can there is an edit mode to input changes yourself will be a big help when you are lost the battery sucks hours at best i sent magellan two e mails asking to clarify no reply not even an automated response oh one more thing when my wife used it the first time she complained that the battery ran out she had put the charger plug in the head phone jack ! i don t blame her the headphones and charger jacks are located close together and about the same size you have to turn on the light and look closely and also memorize how to handle this thing without accidentially pressing buttons also when you pick it up you can t tell if the unit is up or upside down immediately junk junk jun 
not needed cheaper to go to radio shack or most stereo stores and get exactly what you want of equal quality at a lower price 
don t waste your money like i did i purchased the cyberpad x digital notepad with the expectation that i would be able to digitize my sketches and notes i made at work unfortunately the product did not live up to my expectations the first unit that i received did not function the usb connection to the pad was defective the connector would not insert all the way hone i returned it and received very promptly a new unit which at least functioned as far as being functional that is another story i proceed to try to use the it in either using the memory in the pad itself or using it directly connected to the computer either way the unit produced images that were useless the lines that look fine on the paper pad were incomplete or missing in the digital version drawing a straight line was impossible even with the help of a straight edge i let a friend try to use it and he had similar unsatifactory results unless this performance is a function of this manufacturer s design i would say that this is one technology that is not ready for prime time 
squeal of death i own one of these it came packaged in my dell xps renegade sound in a windows environment is good as indicated by other reviews but in a gaming environment for example world of warcraft and not just this game i and other user s have experienced the squeal of death wherein the sound will become replaced with a high pitched squeal and may hard lock your computer either way this can only be corrected by rebooting check out the forums before buying any creative labs products buyer beware ! 
will not work as digital audio cd r avoid a headache i had the same problems with these new memorex music cd rs they will not work in my philips cd audio deck and as you can see in other reviews they don t work on most decks i suspect they are plain digital cd rs or that the newer x discs will not work on digital audio decks a design flaw at any rate i have had great luck with older memorex music cd rs but i believe they were x i have no problem with sony music cd rs which are easily available and cheaper most places however memorex is good with warranty service in my complaints about these great for dummies who pay extra for music cd rs for their computer because they are copying their friends cds 
poor construction the teeth on the metal contact broke off after first use in top flight dslr equipment 
antenna broke when i went to use this product i didn t even have it for a day and the antenna broke 
junk this is an extremely cheap product poor grade of plastic and sound quality is for the lack of a better word gross the earbuds that came with my ipod are times better ! it s on it s way back ! stay away 
not a quality item this item worked for a while but required fiddling unplugging and replugging repeatedly with the lighter socket each time i restarted my car eventually however it blew out the fuses in both my lighter sockets don t waste your money on this piece of crap 
not worth the effort with so many other mounts to choose from why buy one that doesn t fit us homes apart studs true you can jury rig the unit and move the mounting plates in but why this product is unacceptable for anyone wanting to mount on studs behind drywall it s probably fine for brick stone or somewhere else where you re using anchor bolts im returning mine 
ginormous waste of money i have purchased three of these dvd players in the past years every one of them has had the same problems trouble reading dvds dvds skipping discs freezing and the manual buttons stopped working on two of the units the price is right on the unit but not for the time it worked i would have been better off spending double or triple the unit price to get one that worked for more than months without a problem if i could give it less than star i would because thats really what it is worth nothing 
nice projector but bad odor i recently bought this projector not through amazon and ended up having to return it it has a persistent burning odor i thought it would go away after an hour or two but three days later and many hours it was just as bad it was so bad that my wife opened up the windows in our house and it was in the s outside i liked everything else about the projector it was light and fairly small the fan was quite and the picture was bright if it didn t smell so bad i would have kept it 
cannot recommend pros its been weeks since ive had it and it hasnt erased my datacons must turn off computer to turn off harddrive sometimes isnt recognized by the computer inner ring is supposed to show how much space is left on the drive it doesnt do that support is a joke had to call times in days just to be put on hold i was on hold for minutes and the guy was anything but helpful bottom line i guess its not that bad but i would recommend purchasing from another company my luck with them has been anything but good but the price is pretty reasonable but just be careful if you decide to buy from wd 
worked like a charm for hours install went smooth on my wk dell inspiron notebook everything worked fine for hours then it just stopped worked with customer support for about an hour getting nowhere this thing is junk i m sending it back 
broke in less than a year the player stopped working after only a few months it would accept dvds but not play them and refuse to eject them that behavior started out as intermittent but it finally gave up the ghost and swallowed a dvd and never let go we had to take the player apart just to get the dvd out before throwing the player away in the trash our previous dvd player lasted over years before it started skipping this one lasted less than a year before it stopped working altogether what a waste save your time and money and buy another machine 
not exactly what i was looking for i primarily purchased the product for recording lectures and it did not work well the mp recorder records the lecture afterwards recording is really bad sometimes it doesn t record at all or it erases the file or there is an error in addition the volume sound quality is bad not loud enough in the end you need the software to transfer files takes forever to figure out what to do my brothers bought mp player called matchspeed red color good price and it worked great best player we ever had times louder then scan disk and the best thing no software needed to transfer files just drag he items into the folder thats all to it and it records great i hope this advice will help saving everybody s time 
service and product terrible bought the cable after printing the usb connection failed so called manufacturer he said cable was broken and gave me a rma emailed tiger they said i would have to ship back at my own expense called amazon they gave me another person to contact at tiger they said to ship it back and they would reemburse me it would cost as much or more to ship back and since getting conflicting statements i don t trust them to reemburse me would suggest you stay awa 
too cheap to work well the sound is a bit distoted radio reception is ok but the headphone cable is too short the most anoying is that there is now way to keep the unit from changing stations at the slightest touch cds and ipods have a hold switch this item keep going ot the next station with no way to lock it to a station also it does not store presets 
pain i have a mouse intensive job with dual screens working on digitizing maps unlike the reviewers before me i have a normal size hand over the years i have developed a slight pain on the top of my wrist my favorite mouse so far has been a microsoft wireless mouse similar to the design but with the fake leather on the palm which is no longer available i saw this ergonomic natural mouse advertised on microsoft s website six months ago and purchased one the second it became available the mouse caused instant pain in my wrist i tried using the mouse for a week in different positions thinking i just had to get used to the mouse my wrist pain just got worse after a week the pain in my wrist was so bad i wasn t sure it would ever go away not only did i have pain while using it but for days after stopping although i have a mild pain in the top of my wrist from normal mousing this mouse caused pain in a different location at the base of my thumb i returned the mouse and returned to my old mouse 
sad compared to older models just purchased units thought they would work as well as the novi units they were replacing however they have absolutely no range my original novi channel units worked well from a distance of approx ft from house to barn these only work in the same room i am attempting to return these currently 
only worked for months i bought this dvd player to play dvd s from australia it worked great for about months with very light use however it started freezing up and not reading discs after doing research i learned that the laser lights on these machines are very weak and don t last long it s cheaper to buy a new one than to get it fixed hold out for a better product 
this phone sucks i ve owned uniden products in the past and have been generally happy with them but quality control really dropped the ball on this one i bought this phone because it was reasonably priced and had the ghz technology i was gravely disappointed i can t sit feet away from the base without getting mind numbing static ! my old rotary dial phone can do better than that ! don t buy this phone 
jvc used to be reliable not any more pros it s prettycons it s garbagesure wished i had checked here at amazaon before i bought this i can t believe jvc put out such garbage ! so many of these cd players have broken that they can t keep up with the replacement parts week wait i guess i was one of the luckier ones mine lasted almost months before it died bottom line if you haven t bought yet look elsewhere if you have keep your receipt and warranty handy 
good for business bad for home i purchased this projector to watch movies at home and have not been pleased with its performance our dvd inventory includes both x and x formats as this is a dedicated x projector dvds that are x will have black bars at the top and bottom of the screen if you have a dedicated x screen like i have this will not work if you like a clean image at the edge of the screen if i mount the projector to fill the screen then the x dvd image is projected above and below the screen perhaps i don t have it setup correctly but that was the best i could do specs say this projector has component video inputs which it does however they are part of the monitor input jack and you have to spend another for an adapter to connect to them our family room is x and the fan is too loud when you have the bulb in high setting you do get a great picture though we could barely hear the fan in low setting but the room has to be very dark to get a decent picture projector comes with a cd that has the manual and a neat screen size calculator that figures the distance from the screen the projector should be located 
didn t work i followed the install instructions to the letter but the install program started giving me an error that i couldn t get past i downloaded the latest install from the linksys web site and got past the point where i had been getting the error but i couldn t get the print server to connect to my wireless network when i had the print server connected to my network via an ethernet cable it detected the attached printer but couldn t even print a test page successfully this product was a complete waste of time 
not great i was looking for a small cheap mp player and i didn t care how much memory it had so this seemed perfect for me i saw that many people had rated this and stars so i decided to buy it when i got the creative nano i was really happy with its preformance until i tried to put my subscription music onto it thats when i learned that it wouldn t hold any subscription music forcing me to buy my music one by one which is costing a lot of money after that i started realising all of its imperfections you can t use the fm radio in the car without hearing mostly static you can t search through songs without actually changing the song you are listening to don t get me wrong there are some good sides to this mp player but i still would definately not recommend it 
the tablet i received this tablet and it looked real good i loved it i pluged it in to the computer and put cd s in and nothing the cd s did nothing the wacom tablet doesn t work so here i am with the tablet the mouse and the pen sitting by my computer and out the money wondering why i even bothered buying this thing in the first place dont try it because you might just get i did a wacom tablet that doesn t work and then you are out the money plus figuring out how to get your money back or how to get in touch with the sellers i have tried and there are no answers anywhere there are no phone numbers to call for help no numbers for trouble shooting you are on your own no return numbers or adresses you are left with this so think again before you waste your mone 
very disappointing for a cisco product or linksys most of the claims made on the description require a service so the service costs a fortune compared to the camera the basic management software that came with it is bad its old and no updates available many features are unavailable and if you actuate the drive space limitation the whole setup is trashed and you have to start over in setting up again some of the features that dont work are the ablilty to name cameras and it sometimes just misses one of the cameras for no apparent reason the hard sold feature of emailed info from a motion sensor and being able to check vids from the internet is the service shame on the maker for selling a partly disabled product and then asking a monthly fee to make it work 
basic functions ok put caution on ps ports i acquired this unit about a week ago to serve as a docking station for a new laptop computer that does not have any of the traditional ports on it you must install the software that comes with it to use the serial or parallel ports and i had to reboot my computer to get the parallel port working note that the serial port appears on a non standard setting mine is com so any software must be directed to that location i have not tried the serial port but the usb and parallel ports appear to work fine however beware that the ps ports on the unit do not work the same way as built in ps ports a keyboard and mouse plugged into them will perform their basic functions but if you have an advanced mouse or keyboard with extra keys or other options they will not function through the docking station it appears that the ps ports on the docking station are wired to always appear to the operating system as some form of generic human interface device mouse and keyboard rather than recognizing whatever form of keyboard is plugged in as happens with built in ps ports because of that i could not find a way to get the computer to match the special mouse and keyboard drivers required for the advanced functions to those devices when connected to the docking station kensington support ignored my first two requests for help on this issue and then suggested i contact the keyboard and mouse vendors which does not make any sense because the devices work fine any time except when they are connected through the ps ports on the docking station i had to find another way to bridge my keyboard and mouse into a usb port to get them to work for that reason i probably would not have purchased this unit if i had known about this issue however if you only need a parallel and serial port as well as two usb ports this unit will work fine 
unacceptable this model was intended as a replacement for my not veryold and yet quite functional panasonic pm series stereo this is the kind of thing that happens when you browse amazon while drunk late at night unfortunately with the exception of a very slight advantage in audio quality the sony is in all respects inferior ergonomics appearance and above all fm reception which is laughably poor do not buy this stereo if you expect a quality receiver hiss abounds several local stations i heard previously are now unreachable and to top it off sony has stuck with their time honored habit of using proprietary connectors so when i went to plug in an after market antenna to get better reception i found a weird little plug that i hadn t noticed when i put the damned thing together grrr so now i m going to sell this thing and buy a nice new panasonic with the proceeds death to sony 
bad piece of machinery we had troubles fromt he start they correct a type would not work took to a brothers repair shop and they could not fix need some parts plus when you tried to type letters you would get numbers it was the present my daughter wanted the most for christmas and she could not use very sad so i will by another brand at a local store in town 
constant noise july st i was looking for a dvd player for my bedroom at costco and couldn t resist the price for this brand new philips hts hts is the same except that it comes all in silver rather than silver blacki played some dvds and cds and after days i decided to return it for reasons it makes a hissing sound when it s turned off now it wouldn t bother me too much in a basement althought it would still be anoying but it s a definite no no in the bedroom rear speakers are almost silent no matter how much you increase the volume to them if you don t mind these things then by all means go for it aug update having nothing better to do i went and purchased another unit from costco to see if indeed i have a bad unit or it s a design manufacturing issue surprise surprise second unit makes the same exact noise only a bit louder curious enough im a mechanical engineer with some knowledge of electronics i open the unit to see where is this noise coming from it is the ac dc transformer more specific two uf capacitors making this noise that is really poor design and or low quality components i did not expect this from a brand name like philips this is no different than any no name units out there at half price as a result i am changing my initial reivew and recommend that you look for a different product this one is definately not worth the money i cannot update the stars but this time i would rate it with stars oct update it stopped reading cds but it reads dvds no problem returned to costco ! 
shiny but still scratched i bought this product in order to remove the scratches from my ipod after using it exactly as directed which involved large amounts of scrubbing with an unpleasant smelling goo the scratches were still on my ipod the ipod was shinier i admit but if you want a shiny ipod you could probably use a wet cloth and get the same results the miracle sounding gets rid of all scratches is competely untrue not even the small scratches disappeared 
sounds great cd player dies great appearance and sound jvc has produced a nice sounding unit speakers look as great as they sound no problem handling bass at loud levels tuner is very easy to use usb input works flawlessly now the bad news the cd mechanism breaks down and is unable to read any cd whether store bought or mp burned first unit died after three weeks the replacement lasted five cd player mechanical design is unable to handle light use will think twice about buying a jvc again 
stopped working almost immediately extremely disappointed especially after having done a lot of research and read the great reviews that this product and the axion player received i bought it for my wife for a road trip and she was excited about the large screen and the ability to connect an antenna to watch tv the player worked fine for the first dvd we tried but after that the screen freaked out and went almost black you couldn t see a picture but you could hear the movie just fine no complaints about the sound i guess but what good is that if the screen doesn t work needless to say i returned this as fast as possible in fact if i could rate it less than one star i would since it didn t even last one day terrible product 
panasonic couldn t locate a replacement part i surely wouldn t reccomend buying this dinosaur bought it online and it never did work panasonic support was as bad as it s dvd one support specialist told me to unplug it and then plug it in again another was reading from a list of what to do if the caller says this the repair shop gave me the idea that panasonic no longer makes this product they couldn t find a replacement part so they are replacing my dvd in all i ve waited over a month and a half to watch my dvd player and i still haven t got a new one from the repair shop if your smart don t purchase one of these antiques 
good idea poor engineering even when i realized that it were merely a storage device not a reader disk stakka still seemed interesting but then within minutes i realized it couldn t eject any disc i inserted after calling m they suggested an automatic calibration probably because the plate must have been misaligned with the ejecting slot it worked at first but started to fail after another minutes surprisingly autocalibrating the device again a minutes process worked for the next ejects afterwards it refused to eject unless you calibrate it again i asked for a replacement unit to m and they said that since i ve bought it online on ebay it was sealed and brand new mind this they couldn t do anything to help me by the way they don t offer any kind of repair service on this product even if you re willing to pay like me if it breaks on you you re on your own 
terrible worst than original stylus the replacement stylus is terrible much lower quality than the original stylus that comes with the ld the replacement telescoping top is too loose and thus wiggles around a lot in your hand and it doesn t extend and retract smoothly into the barrel i would rather get a stock ld stylus than get of these replacements 
another dud we bought this for the kitchen after much research and waiting two weeks for it to ship from amazon we were very excited to open it up and get going the first problem was apparent before we even plugged it in no remote in the box then we plugged it in and proceeded through the setup there was a two inch green stripe running vertically down the middle of the tv no amount of adjustment to the settings would make it go away we had to send it back but amazon no longer had them i will give it one more try from another supplier but if it has the slightest problem i m buying something else 
do not buy tried customer support to resolve a hook up issue and did not return emails for five day have almost given up 
one of the worst network cams on the market the camera locks up many times it is certainly not for those who want this camera to be monitoring all the time the software is messy it goes to full screen mode and never comes back ideally when you are away you would be contrlling the pc through remote it is very difficult to control this from a remote location the software lacks the ability to auto detect the camera at startup the software is poorly written by by someone who has never been in this business dlink has no support at all please don t waste money in this camera 
great product at first this is the same unit that hp sells but has lite on do its support great unit for about a month support is not good 
not a recommended product sensitivity is below par on short wave i also own a sony icf swgr a much better radio in all respects if you want a good radio for short wave listening buy the sony 
could have been fantastic this unit could have been fantastic if not for one issue almost all the navigation fuctions cannot be used while the vehicle is moving over miles an hour what good is having all this power and information at your fingertips and not be able to use it when you need it if you are going down the highway and you want the unit to find a restaurant or an address you have to pull over and stop to enter it into the unit this is just plan wrong and there are many other units on the market that will let you imput information without stoping the car i can understand not allowing dvd s to be viewed while driving but restricting the ability to imput address into the unit while in motion is just plain stupid i highly recommend you do not buy this unit as you will be very disappointed 
not as good as my year old wacom i wanted to get back into digital painting recently and so i planned on buying a new tablet and upgrading to painter ix along the way of researching what new tablet to buy i ran into this brand and after seeing all of the positive reviews on this page i decided to give it a try i was very disappointed i have an year old wacom digitizer ii its so old that wacom doesn t have a single reference that it ever existed but i assumed that my wacom was less sensitive compared to the newer models even from non wacom makers the real catalyst to buying a new tablet was that my new computer doesn t have the serial port that the digitizer ii uses i told you that it was old i plugged in the cyber tablet and played with it for a while and i just couldn t get into it it doesn t have as smooth a surface as the wacom plus the pen is almost twice the thickness the worst part by far is the sensitivity differences between the two when you lightly drag the pen across the surface it doesn t always create a light line instead its very inconsistent i adjusted the sensitivity levels for a long time and never found a setting that solved this problem the construction is reasonable but it certainly doesn t feel as quality as the wacom at this point i am sending back the cyber tablet and keeping my wacom digitizer ii even though it is a little banged up and i have to buy a usb toserial converter to make it work i was really excited about this lower cost tablet after reading the previous reviews but i am not convinced that any of them have used a wacom before or compared them side byside a wacom tablet from years ago think processors floppy disks serial mice far exceeded the quality sensitivity and usefulness of the new cyber tablet 
iconcepts hotsync charger not impressed charged fine but the adapter to my ipaq was not secure at all any slight motion of the cable and the pda lost connection to my computer so unless you plan on not bumping your cable or ipaq ever while syncing i d steer away from this also ran into power issues with the iconcepts cradle 
poor customer service i purchased this memory card for a camera i was also purchasing it was listed as an accessory to the camera on the same page when i received the card first and then the camera i was disappointed that the card was the wrong shape and size for the camera and would not fit because i had opened the plastic package to the card i was unable to return it in fact when i emailed the company who sent it i never even received a response 
only slightly better than aluminum foil i had aluminum foil attached via coaxial cable to my t v before i purchased this antenna after hooking the antenna up i noticed only marginal improvements also if you want to change between lesser reception channels you have to completely reposition the antenna i would return it but i would get barely half of what i paid for it since i would still have to pay for return shipping as well as the original shipping cost 
not for win users i ve had a horrible experience with the wireless card in this networking kit all because my laptop runs on win se ! although it claims to work with windows se the software has a flaw that can t find a dll file to make the card work i ve spent hours trying to come up with a fix and i finally contacted dlink for tech help before buying this product read all about the problem this product has with win and decide if you really want the headache i solved my problem by purchasing another card that said it worked with win and actually did i had it running at a dell store in minutes disregard what the box says only use if you run win or higher ! it seems to work really well with xp 
warning ! buyer beware i just shipped my hp back off to where it came from i either have to really like something or really hate something to write a review on it and i really hate this printer i purchased the hp after reading some reviews on the hp and deciding that i didn t need the fax capabilities of the which didn t seem to work well for most people anyhow apparently it s not just the fax feature that is faulty but the scanning and copying leaves a lot to be desired as well i purchased this to replace my aging but still working year old nec superscript laser printer i needed something to make decent copies and to scan in documents well forget it with this ! you will regret buying this electronic made in china garbage if you are planning on using this for anything other than a printer this has changed my opinion on hp as it will yours if you buy it when i first power on the unit i tried copying the vonage advertisement that came with it by running it through the auto document feeder the first thing i notices was that the adf was loud this was fine since noise isn t too much of a concern just as long is it functions well and there isn t anyone else around to be disturbed by it after examining the copy i realized the vonage letters were stretched out about about down from the top of the letters to make things worse there was a oval shape on the vonage ad which this printer distorted one entire side of almost as if someone had tried to trace it with a pen i tried several copies through the adf with the same results over and over i thought that maybe the stretched letters were due to a problem with the auto document feeder so i tried copying the vonage brochure on the flat bed i did not see a problem with the vonage letters being stretched when copying on the flat bed but there was still distortion on the oval shape again next i tried copying other documents with similar bad results copying bar codes revealed that when printing lines close together the black bleeds between them ! edges on copied fonts were a rough as well next i tried connecting the to my pc with usb i ended up with an installation failed message on my first attempt at installing the software looking in device manager i found a problem with installing the driver for generic ieee printing support i tried uninstalling and installing the drivers several times to no avail i then tried a mb full download of the latest full driver release from hp and had the same problem next i tried a smaller mb driver release on hp s site this time i kept getting prompted to locate files that the installation could not find after performing a search on my hard drive i located them in c temp where the installer must have extracted them to i had to keep navigating the installer to this directory numerous times during this install much to my amazement this install attempt actually ended up working now i wanted to test the scanning functionality the included scanning software is very basic it does allow you to setup custom profiles for scanning resolution destination and paper type i first tested scanning with the included vonage advertisement again the results were to say the list shocking and very disappointing first the color scans were washed out second the black on white text had extreme orange and blue halos around the edges almost like looking at a d movie without the d glasses third there were some visual artifices scanning inaccuracies and scanned objects appeared wavy fourth i got the same results as above when using the adf for copying as i did scanning i wish i could include a sample image so you could see the atrociousness for yourselves lastly scans are slow and i found that when scanning in x documents they would often be scanned in skewed no matter what paper the originals were on or how i adjusted the auto document feeder guides furthermore when i scanned documents with print on both sides the print on the opposite side would bleed through from my experience with photo technology my hunch would be that the cheap imager in this needs an enormous amount of light to scan so that images on the opposite side of the page bleed through i really don t want to say anything good about this printer but i will say that printing looked very good and it gets star for this printing was crisp and clear even with small fonts b w photo printing was on the other hand was mediocre but who uses a b w laser printer for photos anyhow my advice would be to look elsewhere for your scanning and copying needs this might do for a cheap printer scannercopier for your kids but not for a professional environment i might purchase the dell dn as it has received good reviews purchase a separate printer and scanner or hold out until something better comes along i hope this review has been helpful and can save you from the hassle and expense of a return 
not audiophile grade not reliable when i received my hd i was excited but after the initial test listen i was not too happy overall speaking the sound is good but it s not good enough to worth almost bux here is my detailed review high frequency response good crisp sound but it lacks detail and sound stage the high notes sound flat and definitly not audiophile sound quality mid good but not great the notes sounds sort of chopped up on mid high frequencies it lacks clarity and detail low frequency bass response the bass respons is not tight and it sounds rather loose i tuned the low frequency to db for testing and the bass started to break up workmanship and build quality i had the headphone for just a few weeks and i found the connector is poorly constructed the sound often go out in one ear and if i jerk the cable the sound will come back the entire headphone is platic and it doesn t look too durable bottom line it s a good headphone but i think i can get the same quality with a dollar sony or jvc this headphone in my opinion is over priced and not so good sound quality not recommended 
poor sound no charge i bought the tomtom go purely for the handsfree functionality which is pretty bad and the ipod control i viewed the navigation part as a bonus an ipod control box from pioneer and a bluetooth handsfree solution from sony ericsson would have cost me about half not including installation things were looking good until i plugged in the ipod it sounds like an old turntable with a dusty record i thought there had to be something wrong so i contacted tomtom they said it had to be my windshield mount they sent me a new one no help there then they wanted it sent in for service i did it took weeks no help there either i am thinking it is a software fault in the operating system or the cpu in the unit is just not up to the job now for the second big let down it doesn t charge the ipod so in winter if you forget to bring your ipod in from the car it ll be out of juice in a very short time 
boo for the sc as a computer dork i wanted to get a little storage device for my home network hours after i began the minute process of getting the sc up and running and all i had to show for it was a lot of frustration and no working microsan if you are dead set on getting one of these please make sure to read the netgear support pages thoroughly first as the description on the box seems wildly different than what is actually supported by the device 
not so great i ve had a pair of these for about a while now they ll last a long time because i don t use them they are fairly comfortable but not great for long use as the bud which is in close constant contact w the inside of your ear is made of hard plastic the other downside is that they produce very little bass unless you hold them right in side the ear opening other than that you re only going to hear mids and highs 
bad product bad company to buy from i purchased this item for my father for christmas one day later is stopped working completely this product was sold thru amazon by ritz camera it has now been three weeks since we contacted this company to either have the item replaced or refunded to date this still has not been rectified i do not suggest that anyone by any product by this manufacturer or from this company in fact i think amazon should drop ritz camera completely each time ritz camera is contacted they tell you it will be to hrs to process the refund or replacement yeah we ve been hearing that for three weeks now buy from them at your own risk thanks 
runs hot functions absolutely flawlessly under vista bit unlike most other cards such as my older wintv pvr if not for the next paragraph i d give it five stars for just this heck it does better under vista x than my old card did under winxp disclaimer i tested the analog video only not the digital but i discovered that it was running extrememly hot even when just sitting their idle so hot that you literally can t even touch it ouch ! i ended up removing it from the case as i didn t trust it perhaps it s a vista driver issue in that the driver is not card go idle even when it s not in use emailed tech support but they offered no real answer other than it shouldn t be warm at all 
cheap made phone it works and plays well but not made great some buttons you have to press twice to make it work call id works fine 
unreliable and breaks i purchased several of these presenters to use at our agency i made my decision primarily based on the reputation of microsoft when i first received the product i was pleased it has a good weight feels like a quality product and is easy to use however after only a few uses we found the usb component to be a total waste of money it breaks easily and then the presenter will not communicate with the pc we basically have over priced laser pointers because the usb portion of the devices broke i must add that the equipment wasn t abused or mishandled the usb portion is just fragile 
satalite code cannot find the satalite code for my direct tv the other codes work for the tv vcr and dvd please solve this proble 
poor reception i also had the model before the mv and got great reception this new model gets terrible reception i still have my old model and put the old one next to the new one and it was like night and day with the reception don t waste your money on this model ! 
ink cartridges epson s is a nice in printer scanner and copier but the ink cartridges suck this is my third and last epson printer robert h 
battery cover blues my zen nano s battery cover broke within month of purchase date the construction is very flimsy and if you do your research before purchasing you will find that this is not an uncommon problem i wish i would have researched a little more before i spent my money on it ! i wouldn t recommend this product to anyone 
be careful these disks would not work with my sony brand dvd writer i have tried several other brands and so far everything works but memorex 
great service if you never plan on canceling i have been a subscriber for years back in november my account was turned off due to a billing issue the week prior to it being turned off i started receiving calls a day for payment i advised one of the reps to wait a week for the payment payment was made calls stopped for another week the radio was then turned off and the calls a day started up again i explained to the bill collectors i owed nothing and when offered to reactivate the radio i told them not to bother at this point i wanted nothing more to do with xm they offered me months of free service to come back anyone who cancels can get this by the way and i refused the calls a day continued for the next week i was informed that it simply takes a week for your name to fall out of their automated system more months go by and then i start receiving a bill saying that i reactivated my radio and owe for months of service and all the late fees that go with that dollars i call in and state i never reactivated my radio thus i don t owe for reactivating my radio and the months of service that would have followed the customer service rep told me that it would be taken cared of weeks later i get another bill i call back and the rep tells me the same thing and apologizes for my inconveniences i even called back the next day just to make sure it was finally resolved and that rep confirmed that i no longer owed anything so then last month i start receiving collections notices you have one month to pay this before it goes to collections i called in and was promised they would look into it and call me back this apparently has taken care of the issue though i never received the call back this week i called times of which i was promptly hung up on for no reason and was told each time that it had been resolved so hopefully this time it really is to anyone considering xm i suggest you just get an mp player 
poor quality control these cases are o k but fragile if you drop one it s trashed my main complaint is that only of them are useable i bought mine at bestbuy when i got them home i opened the package and found most of the cases were missing the little plastic hinge tried to return them but bestbuy accused me of breaking them i went into the store and inspected the other packages those too had most of the hinges missing go ahead buy em if you want to you ll just end up throwing most of them away 
this is really worthless rarely do i write a review but this product is so bad i had to expecting sony electronics to perform well what a disappointment this one is a bummer save your money there has got to a better under cabinet radio out there while the concept is good and the design sleek don t be fooled by the packaging nothing works well fm reception is poor sound is terrible controls are not intuitive to top it all off a year after purchase yep the warrantee just expired the cd player decided to only play the first track of any cd inserted forget listening to the rest of it this product is really zero stars i ve tossed the whole works in the garbage 
nice but wouldn t buy it again the linksys wip offers good sound quality but battery weak lasts an hour in speaking you have to charge it always during standby to make sure you have enough power when a call comes in had several situations where the phone made a reset by itself or didn t reacted anymore so the battery had to be removed then it would restart can t join wireless networks which require authentication offers just a few ringtones to choose from and they all sound horrible there s also no way to load additional ringtones via the usb port somewhere speakerphone was mentioned well not that i ever managed to get that working headset port doesn t work with every plug headset 
horrible cd player well maybe i should give it two stars because of the four units i tested in target this one definitely sounded the best however the cd player is downright pathetic it will not play any homemade cds and i suspect it might have something to do with the company that built it sony is well known for their hyper strident stance on copyright issues so we can t use any of our friend s productions i have several musician friends who record their own music and we can t play any of our own compilation cds in it bummer cds that play in every other cd player we own but not in this one in addition older cds have a tough time getting kick started newer ones last years or so i guess are ok so if radio is all you want this unit does sound ok just don t try to play anything besides mass produced cds 
this is a bad guitar i think this guitar is horrible i mean it looks so bad also the make looks like its yearss old 
garbage buttons wore out in mos i loved this player until the day i really really needed to use it for recording when i discovered that the mode button no longer worked this is the button you need to use to switch from mp player mode to voice record line in record or fm radio the device is now permanently stuck on mp player mode with no ability to shuffle or repeat which is not the worst thing in the world except that i specifically bought it for its recording capabilities which are now for all intents and purposes non existent and months after i bought it too conveniently post warrantythe screws holding the case together are impossible to remove so there s no way to attempt a diy solution to this maddeningly simple but nonetheless irreperable device crippling problem this thing is of no use to me now a paperweight i m never buying another iriver product again 
no ipod controls bulky this device is much bulkier than it needs to be but an even worse offence is that the device cannot control the ipod the ipod plugs in to the back and you have to turn the unit around to reach the back to operate the ipod it is the most ridiculous thing when you have turned off the power to the video unit then turn it around and find that the ipod is still playing and will continue playing forever unless you turn that off too 
buyer beware syntax olevia target purchased this tv december after much research unfortunately for me the tv was defective on arrival when it is working it is a very nice tv but the customer support from both olevia and target leave a lot to be desired target will not replace the item the corporate policy i am told is the item must be returned via shipping you are responsible for packing the item and putting it outside for the shipping company to pick up and once target receives the tv back and it is processed thru receiving a credit will be issued they say within days my credit card company ae says it will take weeks all this time with no tv paying interest on the credit card or paying the balance and not be able to purchase another one until everything clears i don t know about you but that is pretty steep now olevia though it is under warranty i again must pack up the tv in the original box ship it back to olevia and when they receive it back they will ship another one to me the tv weighs lbs packing it up is not easy and again i am without tv for a month or more while the transaction takes place if i want a tv at the time the defective one is shipped i must give olevia a credit card hold while they process the transaction either way the consumer gets screwed ! the television has a one year warranty i purchased the extended warranty what else could i have done i am told by both target and olevia this policy falls under the other terms and conditions i wonder why they don t actually say that buyer beware of target and olevia 
rca wireless headphones can t evaluate ups could not access our area due to snow road closures so apparently the ups driver ups mailed the original soft wrapedshipped headphones by regular mail they arrived the headphones busted the trouble to file a claim under the apparent curcumstances seems more than the paper work troubel to file a damaged inshipment claim so i am just out the cost 
no stand alone raw recording i bought this for a trip to record my photo s from a nikon d i shoot raw and jpeg format concurrently upon returning from my trip i disconvered that the mc only records jpeg files as a stand alone it will record raw files if processed through a pc i contacted sony to see if there is a firmware update that will allow me to record raw files as a stand alone sony responded that they are developing a follow on unit that will have this capability and there will is no planned update for the mc to record raw files as a stand alone 
it will protect your mini but the touch wheel is harder to use i bought this case about a month ago and immediately put my baby into it since that point time i had a harder time turning it off pausing adjusting the volume using the back and forth touch points and setting a stop point in a audiobook this is the result of the mini being recessed into the case i took my mini out of the case today and had immediate ease of use with the touch wheel again the case will protect your mini without a doubt but you lose the functionality that the wheel is so popular for also make sure you tighten down the pivot head with a screwdriver since i nearly almost lost my mini because it came apart from the belt clip ill only use when absolutely necessary now 
save your money beauty is deceiving the worst thing about this radio is that the plastic on off button will be rendered useless after one trip to the beach get near a grain of sand and it will cause the button to stick keep it inside the house and it is a marginal radio at best and confusing to use the plastic body is very cheap as well and seems to disolve when it gets near sun tan lotion thousands of these must be sitting in drawers silenced by the elements ! junk thats why so many ended up in the bargain bins at retailers 
sony alarm clock radio this is the second sony cube clock radio i have owned the first one lasted yrs i see the improvements made i like everything better except it is difficult to see time in darkness the background light is good but the digital numbers are not dark enough 
awful awful after frimware update it completely stop working followed all the instructions correctly hard reset and did everything i can i could not recover do not buy bottom line 
don t buy it the sonicstage is really a disaster i have been using mz rh for a year and i use it for recording music lessons when i upload my files to computer to back them up i alway have some recordings about unreadable by sonicstage even though i can listen to them with the minidv what can i do with those recordings i can only leave them in the md walkman if my mz rh is broken i have to buy another one in order to listen to those recordings obviously i will never buy sony s recorder again 
poor quality a definitely do not buy i wish i had read all the reviews before i bought this unit i stopped working after used only a few times then the no disk warning showed up with a perfect fine dvd in there and pictures started to freeze up here is the funniest thing i found if i shake it it will continue to play if i stop it will freeze so if you want a good exercise machine this might be a good one because my arms are so sore after shake andplay for two hours 
hmm i had this unit for almost a year working perfectly loved it then one day the bluetooth just stopped working it will not connect and the blue light does not come on definitely appears that somehow the bluetooth stopped working for some reason holux has no support number and they have not returned any of my emails to tech support asking for help after several months of trying to reach them i am finally giving up i would not buy this unit especially now reading how many people are having similar issues i like the look of the holux but the support from holux is disgusting 
this product sucks i own a infiniti g this product makes a lot of noise and the skip feature did not work in the g 
fuji cd rfvd slim jewel cas product arrived damaged company antonlinewas unwilling to exchange for new item would never buy from them again 
hasn t worked for a while briefly i have four stations and they never really worked right i presume because of the need to be on the same circuit i want to replace them now but i m not sure i d buy this brand again 
great if you want neck pain this product takes too much space and raises the notebook too high the mechanism of holding the notebook is also rather flimsy its only use is as a usb hub and it is far too expensive for it if you have so much space it is simpler to get a normal usb keyboard for much less the ideal solution is of course a docking station yet another innovative but overpriced and poorly designed logitech product 
the price isn t worth it buy something that works i have owned this projector for almost a year and a half lets start with the pros its a projector it projects i am using it on a ft screen in my bedroom thats about it for that section now onto the cons within a month the dvd player stopped recognizing any type of media placed in it dvd dvd r cd it does not load being that i own an alternate dvd player i just hooked that one up and ignored the problem hoping that that would be the end of my difficulties as shipping back to the company for repair comes out of my pocket eventhough its under warranty and not having a television to watch for that period wasn t beneficial next issue came to a head about months after purchase when turning it on one day the motor ran very loudly a noise level you have to speak almost in a yell when sitting beside the person with which you are conversing the color also seemed to be off reds appear a muddy brown image is much darker without variating tones i e naturally high contrast this more than takes the thrill out of watching bloody horror flix the only source that has a reduced buzz is when using it as a computer monitor but this still is very loud especially on start up since then this is the only way i watch my movies through the dvd rom on my computer projecting a horrible image on the wall my computer speakers also provide much better sound than the built in system speakers which is very necessary to use in order to hear anything over the loud buzzing if you close your eyes you would think it was a chainsaw the picture itself is also very dim i have two narrow windows in my room both with mini blinds and a curtain yet it is still difficult in the daytime to watch anything that isn t a bright cartoon back to my love of horror movies this causes a dilemma finally after saving up enough money to purchase a replacement i am having an epson powerlight c shipped to me hopefully this projector will last longer than the optoma i highly recommend researching other projectors before buying this one just because it has a built in dvd player don t let that win you over it s just as easy to hook up an external dvd player to a better projector i purchased this with the ft screen on the home shopping network for talk about pricey ! next time i won t be so hasty to purchase anything this is a piece of junk try the epson powerlight c i have researched and read many good things about this projector it costs less and the lumens is more than the optoma meaning that you can watch dark movies during the day hook up your own cheap dvd player i guarantee you that even the cheapest of dvd players will last longer than this system s built in one go for quality not cheap hooks 
october this dvd player is potentially a great cheap and versatile machine but the two i bought from worldwide distributers were faulty i have a friend who owns a ch dvd which works perfectly with my region english dvds i have a cyberhome dvd player in england which works perfectly as well the two machine i received didnt work very well and didnt play some discs at all this is why i would recommend spending a bit more on another machine after returning two players i decided to buy a philips dvp multiformat dvd player with divx mp windows media support which with a code to allow it to play all regions works perfectly ! it cost with free shipping through amazon so wasn t actually much more expensive than the other player ! see the reviews of this player for the code ! i would also like to say that there was nothing wrong with the service from worldwide distributors and that they refunded most of the shipping costs the problem was only with the dvd players they sent me 
junk this is an extremely cheap product poor grade of plastic and sound quality is for the lack of a better word gross the earbuds that came with my ipod are times better ! it s on it s way back ! stay away 
not a fan of these defective fans these work great initially i bought six of them of the six four broke one stopped altogether one stopped oscillating and the other would only work on speed i bought them in may and they broke after and months respectively they are expensive fans and i was extremely disappointed in their lack of durability they were used at night by adults and were not moved around at all i have had a floor fan for years and it still works without a hitch these are cheaply put together and your money would be better spent on a fan with a better warranty this is year and higher quality components 
the linksys converter was pure junk the product not only did not work but blew out fuses in my car the mechanic who checked my car out said the device had a dead short in it i have written to your customer service department and asked for money back but to no avail i will not purchase another thing from amazon until my money is refunded 
terrible bad bad bad i m not sure exactly what is wrong with these discs whether it is flimsy material or an asymmetrical center but they are not reliable i purchased a spindle and from the first used only one worked properly this is an expensive waste i suggest going with better quality discs at the outset it will save on headache later 
makes a lovely paperweight and also gave my children an amusing exhibition of what it was like to try to tune in a station on a tv circa pulled in weak signals from about stations miles from nyc broadcast towers 
underpowered unfortunately i picked this unit up with much higher hopes than i should have setup was relatively simple i know what i m doing and i have an existing upnp server on my network so that made life a little easier when you power the thing up for the first time it steps you through network setup locates upnp servers and makes it all go however once i got it running i lost my optimism video was very choppy it was completely unwatchable i futzed with the settings on my router and upnp server and video formats for a week before finally giving up 
junk ! absolute junk ! all of them i purchased of the old model when i bought my ipod as hard as i tried i was unable to switch stations on it okay i thought i must have got the one bad one so i called griffin and they were not much help they said that the radio stations may have been bad and said i would need to down load new software well no luck it still didn t work and the one station i could get sounded like horrible when it worked at all so then i saw the new version out on the market so i figured i d upgrade to one that looked easier to use i bought of them for me and for my wife neither one sounds any good i can recieve a radio station miles away with no problem but i can t hear my ipod from feet away both of them sound exactly the same they constantly sound fuzzy like they are just not tuned in right if you turn up the volume on the ipod to boost the power to the itrip then the sound distorts before the station fuzz goes away only a fool walks on thin ice twice and i ve done it times now never again ! don t follow in my footsteps ! please take my advice and do not waste you money on this garbage 
this is only ok for the money this is not a bad product but there is alot of hissing sound which doesnt really allow for clear vocal quality i dont really use them i use the wired microphones because of the sound problem 
griffin ifm functionally the ifm is great i like to use it for workouts at the gym to watch fm transmitted tv s however the construction is extremely cheap i bought two of them and both fell apart one fell apart the second time i used it the construction is so cheap that i couldn t put it back together because the controls don t line up i wish there was an alternative but i can t find one i like being able to switch between ipod tunes and fm but will have to carry two devices from now on 
total junk i have to reboot this at least twice per day netgear refuses to acknowledge that their access point sucks 
not much better than plain paper most canon photo paper is very high quality i print to the photo paper glossy and photo paper plus all the time and am very happy with the results so i was surprised that this paper is so dull it is hard to tell which side is the printable side and the printouts are dimensional and not very bright 
no choices i thought this item came with or you had a choice of color it did not it is silver with black trim it is also not very portible you have to play it while its sitting on a flat level surface 
don t bother not a worth while purchase you will be wasting your money on headphones that work some of the time when your tv is getting low volume feed softwhisper dialogue for example you ll get nothing but static imagine watching a movie and going through this every minutes i was told from rca that this is unavoidable and that i should consider using the headphones for listening to stereo music only although this may be fine for some people i wouldn t spend your money on a product that has blatent limitations trust me when i say there are much less expensive products that tower in comparison 
converter first adapter only if you need it i visited ireland from the u s and my hair dryer sparked when i used the adapter and fried both of them also i had a convertor for my ipod but was unable then to use the adapter the usb charger never worked oh well live and learn 
very difficult to use this product is not for novices the labeling on the buttons is extremely confusing the instructions are not written for the layman either 
arrived in pieces they would be very wonderful jewel cases except they must be very flimsy because more than half of them arrived broken 
do not buy any of the belkin wireless products after several hours of telephone support conversation belkin told me that there was simply too much interference in my apartment to allow for a connection between my belkin router my belkin wireless notebook card mind you i live in a one bedroom apartment in queens and the distance between the router and the notebook is no more than feet on top of that i don t have any cordless phone so there i went and bought a range extender to place between the router and my laptop since then i have spent several hours of technical support on a weekly basis because the way they tell me to configure the connections and the wireless bridge just doesn t work ! oh how i wish i had just bought a very long internet cord instead 
gets the job done technically it s a battery charger it charges batteries it s called compact because the bottom part accordians out to reveal additional slots for batteries it feels cheaply made and doesn t hold the batteries very securely also you have to charge two batteries at a time or sets of and they are inserted in opposite directions so if you re charging batteries in sets of two they would be i realize that s how most devices are set up when you insert the batteries but i shouldn t have to worry about that when inserting into a charger especially since according most warning labels on batteries inserting it in the charger backwards may cause an explosion resulting in injury or death that s a lot of pressure for someone who just wants more juice for his gameboy ultimately it does what it says though so if you re looking for a charger to use until you find a real charger go for it 
terrible go for the wireless laser mouse instead terrible ergonomics thumb button that s too far forward and a pinky button or thumb for a leftie that is unusable no tilt scrolling that s right no way scroll wheel it has the same shape as the comfort mouse which i like so for or more less get the comfort mouse trust me search for the wireless laser mouse nice shape also for left and right handed users way scrolling same high resolution laser technology same sleek black look and larger better placed side buttons microsoft missed the mark with this loser don t even bother with it if i could give it zero stars i would simply because microsoft offers better wired mouses for less and better wireless mouses for the same price 
memorex blank dvd s in each pack there have been several dvd s that aren t any good too many bad discs in my opinio 
do not buy died after months could not configure would only reset to default config which gave no security worthless support was bad never again for netgear products ! 
not as expected range is very weak probably less than half a mile don t waste your money 
buy palm usb charger car kit i have a usb ac charger and car charger that came with my palm pda and they work just fine with my nano don t waste your money supporting apple when it charges for basically a piece of plastic 
very disappointing i have always been a big epson fan however i have been extremely disappointed with this printer first of all it burns through ink cartridges which gets expensive secondly i am constantly having to clean the nozzle heads to prevent gaps which uses even more ink so that the text on my documents is legible it s so bad i have to clean them before almost every print job and even then i rarely get a page to print out cleanly also the printer has major problems with the paper feed mostly when trying to print double sided after every page i have to push the paper feed button very annoying for large documents finally when printing photos or anything that has a lot of ink coverage the colors are terrible it s been so frustrating i am thinking of forking over for a laser printer avoid buying this printer 
blue nav program is a rip off i own a magellan meridian marine unit just found out that you can only get access code per program i purchased meg cards in hopes of downloading more than map per card not only can i not down load more than map i cannot get an access code for additional cards lost money all the way around magellan offered me the opportunity to buy the blue nav xl charts at but low and behold they come with the same defect of unlock code per program i was a believer in magellan but switching to garmin today david 
awful i bought these speakers for my emac as an upgrade to the two built in speakers they are in fact much worse than the built in speakers they are about as loud which mind you is pretty low in terms of bass i could not imagine worse speakers i m not really sure how creative could even sell these for the price i paid anyway just really dont buy them there guaranteed to be worse than whatever speakers you are currently using 
expensive doesn t work with plain paper and ink is painful to find the epson r is a purely photo printer be sure to understand this before you buy so if you are planning to have one printer and think this is it think again the k inks are not compatible with plain paper and any documents you print on plain paper are horribly color shifted and distorted it took three calls to epson and replacing the icc profile before they would finally admit that the problem was the k ink compatibility with the plain paper all the magazines raved about the black and white printing quality not at least not on premium quality photo paper perhaps in some of the more expensive matt papers i saw very little improvement over my epson r now if you are going to use it strictly for a photo printer then this is very nice printer the biggest drawback is you will not find the ink cartridges at any major store such as staples the in stock ink guarantee there does not apply to items not carried in the strore this is hint hint if you run out of ink on a weekend and need to have something for monday you are sol the only option you have is to order the ink online trust amazon as they can find and deliver however if for some reason your lucky enough to have a large pro photo store near bye they may have the cartridges cartridges certainly dont last very long and at each with eight of them your burning a set bulk ink tanks are coming out but i doubt the k inks will be imitated if you can stand ordering everything online and are only looking for a great photo printer than this may be just the ticket for you however at i fully expected to be able to print documents with pictures on plain paper i haven t been happy with this printer and i plan to replace it soon amazon s being able to locate and ship the ink is the only reason its still here 
returned it the next day for bose sells an extremely easy tosetup pair of tv speakers that sound no better than your tv the acoustimass unit is apparently trying to be a subwoofer but maybe only dogs can hear it seriously i unplugged the two main speakers to hear what that big thing was supposed to do and all i heard was some muffled noise trust me i had it hooked up right i fell for the bose cinemate at the target demo wall where it sounded pretty good but once i hooked it up at home and compared it with my tv samsung inch dlp speakers i realized it was a joke i took the advice of reviewer th below and bought the combination onkyopolksony he recommends for the same price much much more value including better sound and the ability to play other audio sources like cds can you believe that this bose unit has absolutely no sound output controls you can t even adjust bass and treble i will admit however that the universal remote they provide worked great even emulating my motorola moxi dvr controls but that was the only thing i was sorry to send back 
apc es very poor ups i had the same experience as the reviewer on i tested the ups by shutting off the power at the breaker within a minute the ups software shut down the computer i had set for minutes so obviously the battery wasn t going to hold up long only load was computer monitor and router at any rate the shut down was successful but upon power up about seconds into the reboot the ups beeped and cut power to the battery backup outlets which killed the computer mid bootup and killed the router for a second or so absolutely worthless as the whole reason i wanted the ups was to prevent shutdowns during the occasional minute power blips i have here 
it doesn t work nothing that uses fw responds to being plugged into this device whether is it bus powered or not bloody useles 
bad firmware and bad firmware upgrades in the past i have good impressions of dlink products with the combination of features and price but this particular router is one to stay away from dlink should have tested the product much more extensively before releasing it the original firmware jan is full of bugs and two attempts at v upgrades made the router unusable dlink support attempted to be helpful but it seems that they are not aware of the problems with this particular router and the responses i received were not helpful at all after going through two routers i returned them to the store and bought an airlink superg arw at half the price on sale and worked flawlessly the first time around i like the feature set and the web gui is pleasant but the bugs are too severe and make the product unusable dns doesn t work after a short period of time incorrect listing of dhcp clients upgrade of firmware cause the web application on the router to die 
goes kaput quickly after normal use this device worked great for a short span of time a few weeks then just stopped working i returned it to amazon and received a new replacement it worked fine for a while then stopped working it s a great idea but very weak quality 
problems problems problems this is a great idea a small cd player to match the rest of the tivoli line unfortunately the quality of the units i tried came nowhere near the quality of the rest of the tivoli line all in all tivoli sent me four of these units and each had problems one wouldn t play the disc one wouldn t eject the disc one had an led readout that would go blank and one had variations on all of these problems the model one is a great product and the pal and the others are close behind but the model cd needs a lot more work 
worked ok for about days then stopped the drive arrived at the end of december was quick to get up and running and worked fine until yesterday then it got the machine equivalent of lockjaw and i ve been unable to get the tray to release so it s a good drive while it operates but i ll probably make sure i pay for at least a year warranty on my next purchase as far as my recommendation goes it depends very much on how inconvenient it is when one s drive fails yesterday i just went to a backup burner and kept working if i had needed to get the job done and i had not previously developed a strategy of always keeping a backup device handy i d have been in a seething hair pulling rage computer hardware is never reliable but is it worth the risk to purchase a device that is known to fail in less than a year 
typical lousy razer performance the copperhead was my rd and last attempt to get a decent performing gaming mouse from the razer people i have had diamondbacks and this copperhead all with inherent problems that could not be resolved the biggest being the expense of the mice the copperhead being the worst of the three with an update format that takes a rocket scientist to get it figured out and never really stood up to half the work it took to get it working second rate the diamondback s both would drop out on bootup and leave you mouse less i did all the updates and preps by the manufactures specs and never got them to work right i have given up on razer and i suggest that any good gamers not waste their money on razer s product i give it stars and that strictly for the lights and color 
what a let down i purchased this mp player thinking it was a good purchase boy was i wrong creative labs tend to have glitches whether it be computer hardware software or other products like this one now having problems with the product is one thing but customer service is lousy and they could give a rats also when i ordered seperate batteries from their online store they mentioned after i purchased their product that it was going to be delayed for an extra month my mp player stopped working after months i did get it to work again two months later the screen told me i had hardware problems ok so i download the drivers that is supposed to fix the problem no go oh and i forgot to mention that i am working in eastern europe at the time so it makes matters even better trying to get ahold of them via phone save yourself some frustration and get something better iriver maybe just stay away from creative lab products 
good for carrying ipod if you don t plan to use it it probably would hold the ipod pretty well but i returned it before giving it a fair trial in that aspect for the price you don t get a whole lot of protection there s nothing to secure the top and the ipod has to be completely removed from the carrying case in order to use the click wheel and view the screen 
almost completely useless i was fooled i thought oh a vertically polarized amplified antenna ought to work pretty well at least a little better than the antenna built into the power cord of my tabletop radio well folks it doesn t in a few minutes you can make a very simple passive dipole antenna ie a hunk of wire basically with a piece of ohm flat twin lead wire you know the stuff that s flat with two wires about a apart in molded plastic goes for about a dime a foot that works better for fm i know because i did a side byside comparison between the terk and my homebrew dipole the dipole pulled in the station i wanted in stereo while the terk antenna could only get me a noisy mono signal at any gain setting as a radio hobbyist licensed ham radio operator i am ashamed to admit that i fell for this one so please don t tell anyone 
mine was doa too how do i assign a rating as several other people have experienced my unit is also doa i received it plugged it in pressed clean and the motor started up i popped open the cover put in the disc i wanted cleaned and pressed clean again nothing terrible quality control whats worse is the unit case is glued together no way to open it up to try to fix the electronics inside without mutilating it and voiding warranty 
not for the new ipod nanos i got this for my wife s new nano but the new nanos are not rounded on the corners like the older ones so the new ones will not fit in this case i ll have to see if i can return it i am surprised amazon is still listing this item 
doesn t include everything this is just a mounting kit it needs a rd party cell phone mount to actually attach to your motorcycle very disappointed that i have to order something else in addition to this kitafter getting a ram mount from somewhere else i don t think amazon sells them this did mount easily and quickly to my bike just be aware that you need a ram mount in addition to this kit which is really just a connection from a ram mount to the garmin devic 
disappointed this may be a good sd don t know because the company would not allow shipment to hawaii therefore ordered the viking sd and it has been a very good sd 
good tape to use for beginners tapes are cheaply priced and the picture quality offered by them is even cheaper i say if your doing everyday recording and dont care about the quality these tapes are for you but if you wanna save your favorite movie or show jvc or fuji is the way to go they both offer incredible picture and sound quality 
dhcp stalls i upgraded my home net with several pieces of netgear hardware including the frp router the wg wifi access point and the fsp an port switch with power over ethernet poe ports the ap and the poe switch have been excellent choices not so with the router although it has features you don t find in a lot of consumer routers like stateful packet inspection spi logging and email alerts it just kept dropping connections to my home pcs for no apparent reason that i could find and no support from netgear the dhcp server would seem to die and all my home pcs would then lose their ips and revert to private ips xx at that point my only recourse was to restart the router after three weeks of this nonsense i said to he with it i m sending it back the router i m interested in now is the smc barricade plus smcbrvpn 
two failures and zero response from sandisk i had a gb titanium sandisk cruzer at work fail i tried several times to contact sandisk including through the selling vendor with absolutely no response my wife s cruzer just failed as well the power light comes on it is recognized by xp and the light goes out the system can t id the device so it s useless it does the same thing on all of the xp systems in our house i ve tried front side usb connections rear connections and hub connections no dice ill never buy another sandisk cruzer and i was going to order another for the office their loss 
kind of expensive for just gig and also doen t have radio fm i don t recomend 
poor video and audio i purchased this product to share my dvi monitor and logitech bluetooth keyboard mouse between my two main machines the exact use promoted by the manufacturer i successfully patched the firmware to eliminate the incessant beeping but am extremely disappointed with the dvi video at by severe streaking and noise and the audio is totally unuseable given the severe hum and noise btw i am using belkin kvm cables dont even think about purchasing this unit 
awful you d think that because these phones have a higher ghz that the sound would be of decent quality not these phones have bad static and when i am on the phone i am questioned about where i am ! ridiculous ! the uniden ghz is a wonderufl phone compared to this one never had any problems of the years i had them however after then they just went dead on me i had the expandable ones and only one just stopped working so i would go with the before i went with the awful quality and sound do not waste your money 
pretty disappointed i really wanted to like this product after reading the positive reviews found on amazon but to me the cowon a left much to be desired i ve been looking into purchasing a pvp for a long time but i ve held out because i was waiting for the one that had all the features that i wanted namely an excellent music player a player with recording capabilities built in an intuitive user interface excellent screen qualitythe cowon a achieved out of music quality is great on the cowon but when i transferred songs over from my pc there was a hiccup at the beginning of every song also this device is not play for sure compatible which was not a deal breaker for me it would have been a nice feature to have however and i m sure it will be a deal breaker for those who are suscribed to music services like napster the built in recording capabilities of the a were also subpar although they advertise they have a high quality mic built in to the device recordings tended to sound scratchy when played back recordings from a tv source were decent but there are other devices like the archos that have the ability to record with s video and component cables which i m sure make a huge difference in the quality of the recording itself navigating the a was a nightmare for me as most of it is controlled by the annoying little thumbstick in order to make a selection you have to click in the thumbstick most of the time i somehow ended up backing out there s a trick to it and you might eventually get it but it was still very annoying to me the one place that the a shined for me was in screen quality videos that were transferred from my pc not recorded from a tv source looked awesome unfortunately the very same video had horrific audio playback on the device although there was no problem with playback from my pc the audio when playing the video on the cowon constantly skipped and for all intents and purposes ruins the video if you are planning on purchasing a pvp do yourself a favor and look elsewhere i personally think the archos would probably be better but reading reviews on that product suggest music playback quality on that device is not that great so that would leave the creative zen vision w but that device does not have direct line in recording sigh i guess i ll have to wait a little longer for the perfect pvp 
noisy a nice idea that doesn t provide adequate audio quality in my experience the unit would pick up noise from the operation of my cd player resulting in a background squealing that was especially audible between tracks in addition on trips i had to frequently flip through the various frequency settings to avoid conflicts with radio stations 
sandisk sdmsv a gb memory stick pro review after buying this product i opened the case after few days as i was out of country to use this memory stick in my camera or other devices however every time i put it in the camera or other devices it gives error and doesn t work i couldn t use this memory stick since i bought it and as i opened the box almost days after the receipt i am not sure how i can even return it back either basically not at all happy with the product at this time 
it s horrible it s horrible you imagine that now you could put your tv up your wall and you get this box filled wit just metal piece and bunch of screws and with a crappy instruction manuel the instruction mannnel doesn t explain at all it s difficult to attach the parts to your tv it doesn t work with all kind of lcd tvs it only works wit some specific parts of walls of your house the only thing i could say is dont buy it 
horses for courses i have no axe to grind with bose i originally bought this speaker for a custom cabinet with almost no room for a center channel set up this speaker has an incredibly small footprint if space is limited this is not a bad option however being honest this is not a great center channel speaker choosing speakers is like the addage certain horses for certain courses your budget your room your components all play a part i have two home theater setups one is a daily gathering area with basic in wall treatments from polk audio the other is a dedicated theater utilizing definitive technologies with b k reference processing clearly the bose vcs can not hold its own with my larger setup however i have run it with my polk audio s and it was workable the timbre match was slightly off and the vocals were not as sharp as they are with my polk csi but it was not awful my bottom line you can certainly buy a better center channel speaker can you buy a better one in this price range i think so if you are only focused on the quality of this one speaker and not the blended sound of your system you should always buy the best components within your budget but remember you are building a system it s not just about one speaker if this speaker fits your space and more importantly matches your other speakers then it may be the right speaker for you 
the easier way to do it i mean seriously guys is it really worth forking over to those greedy peeps at sony over dollars just for a silly memory card there is an easier way to do it ya know for your psp if the game is really important to you and you can t save it just press up on the power switch real quick the screen will go off it will go on hold and next time you wanna play it again just push it back up and hopefully if you did it right you ll have the game right back in the place you left it hey it saved me dollars and it can do the same thing for yo 
did not work ! defective return painful have owned several wd external drives with no problems this one would not work on the pc on the mac etc the package arrived quick enough the internal packing list is so sanitized you dont know who or where to return the item to the return is agonizing ! came from beach audio aviod these guys ! getting a return authorization number is a nightmare ! multiple e mails and calls to them ugggghhhhhhmuch better off getting from the mac store ! buyer beware i totally expect not to get my refund ! 
one of the charging bays doesn t work one of the charging bays always indicates that the batteries in the bay are not in working condition i m also getting unusual behavior from the other indicators i tried the minute energizer charger and i m having problems with this unit as well see my review for that charger frankly i m done wasting my time with energizer chargers now i ve never had these types of problems with other chargers in the past 
time in one small package ok maybe it was in the fine print or something but this alarm clock is tiny ! i didn t realize it would be so small it can pretty much fit in te palm of my hand 
be carefull be carefull make sure this is the upgraded unit that came out recently no reason to buy the old original one because of many flaws in design 
do not buy this phone i bought a kx tgm and in days it died the phone battery not only died but then it would not charge properly with an approved new replacement battery the base could not locate the phone handset so purchase the exact same thing happened except this time it lasted days the price for this phone should ensure that the thing works and works for a period of time more than a month 
two words no mute seems like a fine phone except how can you design a speakerphone with no mute useless for working at home in long meetings 
this thing is useless delivery was fast and transaction was good however the battery icon never got to the fully charged state so there is no way to tell whether it is functioning properly 
this thing stinks i used it once and it charged my ipod only after about four hours the next day i tried it again and it simply ceased functioning entirely this thing is garbage ! 
yes it does not work i can concur this cable does not work it will put sound out but no video of course i have set the video to tv out that s the first thing i did ! i have tried this cable with two ipods on two tvs nothing 
don t waste your time or money i had been told this was an excellent product so i was very excited to receive it however when i got the item i was very disappointed in the quality it feels light and cheap buttons stick often requiring presses to work the learning function says it captures a code but when you attempt to use it it doesn t work despite the claims of philips that it can learn any remote it won t i tried to revert the remote back to factory settings as directed by philips service department but it wouldn t reset all in all spent days trying to program and hours on the phone with tech support 
bad quality i bought this item like months ago and now it s broken i m sooo frustrated i d not recommend buying this item 
started good but ended bad i had this card for more than months and it worked super in my canon powershot a transfers went well too then all of a sudden for no reason i kept getting card error on my computer and digital camera a week ago my sd usb converter couldn t find the card either i had really good photos i wanted to transfer to my computer and now they are probably lost for good what a joke 
mis ordered returned no acknowledgement of receipt of goods the product that was sent was misordered it should have been the gb sandisk micro memory card permission was secured to return the card it was returned in the original package plus an additional envelope it has now been about three weeks since it was returned via the us postal service the vendor has not acknowledged receipt of the item 
pathetic doesn t work waste of money beware of this product it always freezes up half way though the download when transfering photos to my computer i have another usb card reader that works perfectly i upgrade to get the speed boost with usb but this product is fundamentally flawed and buggy 
no support i paid dollars for a new magellan gps less than a yearand a half ago from boat us and they have already declared it obsolete if you expect any support do not buy magellan 
probably not worth it it was very bright at first then button began malfunctioning i emailed customer service and never heard back don t know if it was a problem with my unit or a poor quality button 
arrived in pieces they would be very wonderful jewel cases except they must be very flimsy because more than half of them arrived broken 
well design except for the notebook itself the bag is very nice looking nice material everybody loves it lots of compartments inside fit all accessories i need plus some documents but the top part the zipper is a big problem it just has to get in a way while the notebook pocket doesn t provide any flexibility i just have to scratch my brand new notebook in and out very frustrating same as another review here my opinion find another one i m gonna do it myself 
no bass awful headphones these headphones have no bass whatsoever i would never buy these please keep shopping as there are better products for the money out there the headphones that came with my mp player out of the box are way better then these 
macally cigarette power adapter for ipod i wanted an cigarette lighter power adapter for my ipod but this must be for the old fire wire version my ipod cord is usb this was usless to me ! i am sure it works fine if you have a fire wire cable ! double check this before you make the purchace 
disappointed big disappointment more so because it was a gift the first word we looked up wasn t in it bigger nuisance than help 
oh dear after owning a aquos for over a year i decided on another purchase from this quality product company to my dismay after setting up this i discovered the screen was damaged figuring this was an error in handling during transit i placed a replacement order pleased with the speed of turnaround i was horrified to then set up this one up and be unable to get a picture after troubleshooting until blue in the face ! i will continue to use amazon as they ve always been reliable in the past i just now hope that i get both refunds in a timely fashion 
not working yet i received and installed this card yesterday it was not recognized by windows neither was the driver included on the cd sabrent s site didn t have any driver for the card either but did have a wonderful faq link about it well i m assuming that it was wonderful since the url was broke i m giving them a chance to respond before i send it back 
star seems to nice this was the first it what seems to be an endless quest for a good working radio it was hard to get the stations in and those that did come in where kind of fuzzy it didn t seem to work well when joggin like the stations would fade in and out from the bouncing i m not sure what the deal was i spent on it but after a while the here and there is making me look foolish 
dvd operation is very poor while the price for this hts is very nice the performance is substandard there s a hissing sound when the unit is off the dvd player has trouble playing dvds i have a large dvd collection most of them don t play the surround quality is also very poor it s a stretch to call it surround sound when half of the speakers don t put out much sound in order to get this serviced i have to send it out for up to months i bought a progressive dvd player put the audio through the phillips hts and the video to the tv and suddenly the picture was better and the sound was better 
i ve returned this item i ve returned this item because the color is not pearl white as the website showed plus my friend also did not like this color since it does not match with her ipod 
terrible absolutely terrible i think this is the same razor as the more expensive stand clean razor i have a light beard and this razor takes twice as long as my other braun shaver it rattles and has a obvious lack of power now i have always bought braun shavers and they have lasted years i predict this won t last the year out save your money mik 
not what i expected as previous reviews state there is no clip which is the reason i purchased it in the first place 
this lock is garbage this locking system is garbage i have of these for a set of laptops that we use as a training lab these locks are difficult to operate as all parts of the lock turn the mechanism is difficult to work and prone to problems because of the way the flip switch on the back of the lock sits we have had of these locks freeze up no combination will open them times i have had to use a hack saw to remove them from the laptop i recommend that you do not buy this lock ! 
lost sound the unit has many positive features however the signal is easily lost indoors and often outdoors as well if it were not such a hassele i would return the unit and continue my hunt for one that is better functioning 
hate the thing the picture is outstanding but lately it has been crashing on me it will just stop at a random point brand new discs even stop and give me an error code then i have to go around back and unplug the player just to get the disc out going to return it and hope for the best but from what i ve read other people are experiencing similar problems 
worst phone this is the worst phone that anyone could ever buy there is constant static and clicking in the background making it hard to hear the person on the other end to make it worse it only has room for programmable numbers and only two choices for ringtones both obnoxiou 
i swore i would never buy a d link product again and i was right i should have passed on this it was a pain to configure and then none of the settings would stick whenever i changed the default password it would never let me log back into the camera without having to do a reset that kind of defeats the point returning this item so i can get something decent the money saved is not worth it 
dont waste your money grossly over priced and useless sony s headphones sounded just as good the headphone fit in the ear s uncomfortable at best 
i returned this item not functional this item was not practical it looked good but not being able to zip the sides all the way down because of the cute water bottles was not very functional 
decent mount bad design i own the explorist le and bought this mount and the cigarette lighter adapter for the unit to use in my truck as noted in some of the other reviews the usb connector which also provides power to the unit has a ridiculous screw on method of attachment understanding that it may be necessary to have a non standard usb type of connection for water tightness there must be a better way to accomplish the connection when you have the mount stuck to your winshield and try to connect the usb external power cable it is nearly impossible to get the power connector through the mounting bracket and properly aligned with the back of the magellan and be able to screw on connector that is rather tight between the back of the cradle and the mounting bracket arm that attaches to the windshield the same screw type connector that is used on the back of the magellan battery compartment it apears that the usb connector is supposed to clip snap into place onto the back of the bracket so you can remove the magellan and leave the cord in place on the bracket i couldn t get it to hold or keep the connector eventually the main tab that is supposed to hold the usb connector in place eventually just broke off i found it impossible to insert the magellan into the cradle and connect it to the external power cord without removing it from the windshield when i received the bracket the head was loose on the end of the flexable arm i removed a few screws and tightened the head which wasn t a big problem i found the bracket itself keeps the unit as steady as can be expected and does not droop or change position over time whereever you move it to it stays put i do like the side to side pivot design of the mount that allows me to turn it to face me when i need it and can be centered so the kids wife can see it when i don t need to if i was just using the mount to hold the unit and didn t plan on using the external power adapter the mount would receive a out of i m a professional engineer and in my opinion this system needs to be sent back to the drawing board for a new design 
no cable i just received the printer in trying to set it up i realized there is no computer to printer cable included nor any explanation of what kind you need you have to bail out of the setup and solve that little dilema 
thought it was great until a month later this item was working fine for about one month then it stopped functioning my computer and several others i tried as a double check could no longer read from the device very disappointing 
it was working for couple months i bought this trendware tu s couple months back it was working great except that i had to unplug the cable before hibernating my machine otherwise the machine will hang during bootup today windows sees it as an unkown device it was working an hour ago i give it two stars for it is not very reliable broken after rarely used for couple of months and that the cable needs to be unplugged before the machine is shutting down hibernating i would have given it four stars if it were not broken by the way my laptop is dell inspiron i haven t tried it on any other machine 
iriver products lack plug and play with macs i have an iriver t and there is virtually no software to support the usb plug and play interface that mac owners have always expected pay a little more and buy an ipod it interfaces with pcs and macs equally well 
bad quality purchased thinking it was gold plated as advertised but actually is not quite noisy settled for a monster stereo maletomale cable instead 
piece of junk don t bother with this charger keep looking i do not have enough negative adjectives for this charger echo the other reviewers regarding the sliding contacts they barely work correctly right out of the package consistently getting disconnected at the slightest bump my bet is that after a year of use they don t work at all and after a disconnect you start the hour cycle all over again which brings me to my second complaint the charger works on a timer something that is not specified on the outside of the package this is the worst way to charge your batteries cooking them with a full charge even if they don t need it get a charger that senses voltage and your expensive batteries will last a lot longer another thing this charger will charge only an even number of aa aaa batteries something else that is not specified on the outside of the package it has four separate charging circuits each circuit will work only if it has two identical batteries in it c d and volt can be charged individually again this is a very bad way to charge your batteries especially if the two batteries have different discharge levels and finally the quality is very very poor one charging circuit on my unit didn t work right out of the package it kept showing that it had bad batteries in it even though there were none 
unusable i bought these for use with my hp dvde lightscribe dvd burner the device would not write to them not one of them ! i have never had this problem when using similar blanks with hp and verbatim labels the memorex blanks i had were made by cmc magnetics what a waste fyi windows users can get a small but distinct increase in label darkness with the use of a free utility found on lightscribe s site it increases the contrast best quality labels do take longer to create i guess amazon does not allow web addresses if you want the utility search for lightscribe exstended label contrast utility without the quotes or you can take a big guess at the name of a commercial site devoted to lightscribe 
use on high res lcd monitor terrible results scan line interference looked like steady stream of waves 
poor product despite not being written on the packaging or website my hp ipaq rx was compatible with this keyboard unfortunatly the software supplied was extremely bad clogging my pda making it run very slowely as well as this it also flickered when in use making the settings for the keyboard very difficult to change in terms of hardware i found the size and position of keys to be the biggest problem while targus does include all rows of a standard keyboard it shrinks the top row numbers and the bottom row space bar this makes it very difficult to use the space bar which is for some reason split into three parts and the numbers which could have been made full size as there is nothing else in the way i found myself constantly not hitting the right key or not hitting the right key hard enough for the key to register in terms of key position there is a gap between the keys on the left side and right side of the keyboard making hitting the keys in the middle very difficult some keys are also very small eg the right shift key and backspace making them difficult to use strange considering they are used a lot on keyboards one of the biggest problems i had with the keyboard was the lack of proper arrow keys targus includes an oval shaped four direction button that controls a mouse cursor that appears on the screen this mouse cursor is useful but needs to be supplemented with normal up down left and right keys which are needed when typing to go back to another part of the document using the mouse to do this is very frustrating the final negative thing about this keyboard was the price i paid aud for this keyboard doing some research on the internet found better models ie think outside stowaway ir keyboard available for less than half the price around aud and bluetooth keyboards available for less than aud i think it might be about time targus releases a new model pda keyboard with a design and software that are suitable for the use the keyboard will get no more tiny keys and no more than two space bars 
this emergency radio will let you down when you need it most the antenas on this unit are so small they might as well not be there if you live within a mile or two of a radio tv or weather station you will get fair reception otherwise you will not get any ! even the am antena is undersize the sound quality was very poor with much whistling and poping from poorly sheilded poorly tuned circuits there is no option for regular batteries or dc power options connections for external antenas am fm tv weather band and high quality antenas as options would be great the clock alarm display buttons digital tuneing and flashlight are well designed however the company needs to put in a telescoping antenna for fm tv and weather band and a larger am antena or they should take this product off the market as an emergency radio in an emergency information can save your life and lack of it can kill you the poor reception from this unit will not give you the critical information you need in an emergency situation come on gpx yorx electronics you can build better products than this i returned mine for a refund i have purchased an american red cross fr emergency radio and found it to be ok it at least gets weather band stations instead of zero on the gpx unit and with a lot of finess manually tuneing you can get a few tv stations i am trying a sony icf mv portable fm amtvweather radio with sleep turnon timer next it has no built in charger or flashlight so haveing extra batteries is mandatory for emergencie use perhaps someone will come up with dc hand generator w batterie for powering any device with a dc adaptor plug one that works with cell phones would be very good for the next hurricane like katerina 
shoulda read the reviews i got two of these as a gift and right out of the box i had problems with them ive owned p s the corded versions of this controller for over years now and they are great the included software for saitek controllers is brilliant as well the controllers are well designed and fit comfortably in my hands they re like the perfect balance of playstation and xbox size the only downside is that they only have shoulder button instead of but you get used to that so why not go wireless well the only reason i wouldn t recommend these is that the batteries are very poorly designed saitek has even recocgnized this on their site and will ship you a free pair of batteries i got mine a couple weeks ago however that still wont solve the problem and like most reviewrs i ve tried and tried to get these pads to work with little to no avail the individual battery packs actually contain batteries inside one for the wireless connection and one for the controller display the problem is that if one baterry is full when the other is not the charger will not continue to charge the drained battery so while you may get a display on the controller you wont get a connection to the pc or vis versa there is no easy solution to this problem either the user must find a way to drain the batteries without damaging the battery pack and hope that they stay in sync after that which is very unlikely if you really like saitek like me i d wait for a newer model of wireless controllers till then stick with the cords or go with a different brand as of this date saitek has seemingly started to release newer versions of their game pads so hopefully there s a more functional version out there soon if its not out already be warned that the ghz version of this pad is prone to the same problems 
bought two with same problem i use a headset with this phone for meeting and both phones that i bought ended up static and the person on the line couldnt hear me cause the hole that the headset fits into is defective phones in two years and same problem in both of them i recommend spending a little more for a better quality phone 
where has quality gone certainly not into the uniden clx thats for sure i have owned plenty of cordless phones in my day and to be honest i wish i could go back in time to buy up all the older phones i am just one person and i dont know about everybody else but what would be the very first requirement for a good phone to have sound quality second battery life anything after that is icing the sound completely sucks on this phone there is a constant hum and the voices sound slightly distorted and low whle changing the volume does increase the decibel level it also increases all the annoying sound coming from this phone if youre looking for the same quality phone that your old had good luck if you find yourself reading reviews about how good this phone sounds think skeptically about who s writing it i did not invest any money in this phone it was a gift and i am embarassed that i will have to return the gift 
this product corrupted my boot sector when this jumpdrive was plugged into my windows system the software that it loads corrupted the boot sector of my hard drive the lexar technical support was no help at all they told me to reinstall my system luckily the computer repair person i hired was able to recover my data files before the os was reinstalled lexar would not cover one dime of my repair cost i will never purchase one of their product again 
terrible ! don t waste your money i bought the zire s as an upgrade to my previous black and white palm that i had no problems with it has been nothing but a lemon since i got it often when i turn it on it has lines going across the screen and has to be turned off and then on again to get rid of them the graffiti is terrible and rarely works i have to reset it all the time customer support is terrible and did nothing to rectify the problems i even sent it to them at one point and they sent it back in exactly the same condition i sent it to them i don t think they even looked at it after my experience with this palm i will never buy palm again 
bulky to use the cords provided for the hook ups are way too long especially when you are riding a motorcycle i could wrap them around me twice and still have cord left it would be very easy to get caught up in these when turning a corner we returned the item 
a boom box not a karaoke machine i m not sure what i expected after i purchased this for fifty some odd dollars and was handed a coupon for a rebate but i wish that someone had informed me before i lugged it all the way home that when you sing into the mic your voice doesn t come through the speaker i m cool with the machine s sound quality when it comes to playing a cd g if i tap the mic i can hear an extremely faint thud so i know it s on but the volume s too low and yes i adjusted the mic controls if you want to sing along which makes this a dinosaur a boom box in the age of the ipod really had to dig through the stacks of machines to find a box that hadn t been opened so when was my first clue doh 
amazon never delivered i ordered an amazon stocked aquos after one month of waiting amazon sent a notice that the order was delayed another weeks nuf said amazon is not reliable when ordering tv s nor is amazon the best deal available actually they are pretty expensive 
praying on people who don t know better monster should seriously be ashamed of themselves for praying on people who don t know about home theater if you re already getting a picture using a cheap hdmi cable without and sparklies and without the picture blanking out intermittently then that s literally as good as it gets and you d be better off saving up for a better dvd player rather than stuff like this next thing you know monster will be selling ipod usb cables and claiming that they make the music sound better it s the same principle 
good hardware spoiled by bad drivers the creative drivers are dreadful even the signed creative inc drivers crashed my brand new clean vista x installation do a web search on haxksys bsod and you ll see all the users who had the dreaded blue screen of death from these drivers i ve had to disable much of the functionality and use just the generic microsoft whql drivers i won t ever buy another creative product again as enticing as their hardware features are their poor driver quality just ruins everything 
weak this light is very weak for a led light consider the coast digitac ii if you are looking for a high quality flashlight that uses a single aa battery if you don t mind using aaa s the coast tactical power chip is the best there is for a small flashlight if you want rechargable get the coast digi tac focus rechargeable 
bugs in firmware the minor problem is that the user manual claims the user id is admin well it is not frustration and wasted time will occur until you somehow find out that the user id should be left blank to log in the major problem is that the unit only works for twelve to hours before it has be rebooted after twelve to hours it looses the connection to the wireless network once you unplug and plug back the power cord it will work fine for another twelve to hours i am used to rebooting windows every time it hangs but i don t accept having a wireless access point that hangs i am not sure how microsoft was able to convince me it is ok for an os to hang this box is going back i already bought a buffalo that works fine 
great but my friend has this cord to connect his ipod to his stereo and it works great great sound good ease of use etc i wanted one so i went to bestbuy today and got one by rca that sounds just as good for 
don t bother with the alarm clock if you want a wood cabinet radio buy the model if you want a great alarm clock read on i purchased a model about two years ago i loved the wood finish and like the old time look of the controls and the sound quality of the radio is very good that said i have been remarkably unhappy with the product overall this is my first ever review on amazon because i felt so strongly about this product the initial and less significant complaint is that the low contrast grey on brown printed numbers on the control panel are basically illegible in all but very bright and direct light not what you typically have on your nightstand i m a guy in his early s with good vision so this is not your grandpa complaining about this detail next the light in the clock was so bright that we kept a hanky on the nightstand to cover it at night however the real and totally unexpected failure of this product is the alarm clock itself the alarm itself must be set by rotating a bezel ring that is pretty stiff and requires a good deal of force to turn my girlfriend hates it the alarm is on a hour cycle so it will go off twice a day if you don t remember to disable it by one of a couple of different button pressings knob twists required to disable enable the alarm and the clincher the snooze doesn t work like any other alarm i ve ever used if the alarm goes off whether waking to music or to an alarm tone and you press the snooze button after more than minutes of music the snooze will not work and you will actually be shutting off the alarm altogether often if i have a very early flight for example i will wake to music which will take a few minutes to really wake me up at which point i may want to snooze once for minutes before getting up going to my knowledge this is pretty common alarm clock usage i discovered this flaw when i missed an early morning flight from sf to nyc because i did just that i pressed the snooze button once after what could not have been more than minutes of music what i had really done was shut the alarm down altogether needless to say after scrambling to get a later flight and rearrange meetings in nyc i called tivoli to tell them my radio was flawed id bought direct the girl in customer service told me the radio was behaving normally that the snooze would actually serve only as an alarm shut off button if i waited more than about minutes her words into the alarm to press it she also told me that this was normal and it s the way all alarm clocks work ive owned at least a half dozen alarm clocks in my life and have stayed in at least a hundred hotel rooms never have i seen a snooze button that really just shuts the alarm down and let s you oversleep tivoli touts themselves as a high end high attentiontodetail manufacturer they acknowledge that this bizarre snooze system is in fact the way it works and go on to claim that this is normal for alarm clocks in general i can scarcely express how unimpressed i am with this company this product ive now moved the tivoli model to the kitchen and purchased a boston acoustics recepter for the nightstand the recepter s alarm tuning controls are truly excellent especially the preset functions and aside from the audio being slightly bass heavy we love the receptor oh and the snooze works great 
nice concept but terrible reality i brought the t in november after having my magellan stolen from my car it barely last a month from day one i was on the phone with customer service i had to reset it constantly as it would freeze up in the middle of navigating on the highway it then started to reset itself constantly going on and off never completing the task of finding an address i sent it in for repair and they sent me back the same unit with no repair and all the maps removed finally i just had to return to amazon i have lost my faith in magellan and going over to garmin i bought the c yesterday and saw far it works right out the box the navigation is spot on although it does not say the street names the directions are very clear and accurate i can put it inside my window sill in my apartment and get a signal the t took forever and indoors even by the window could not get a signal while i did like the photo veiwer and mp neither one was worth writing home about the mp was tinny and with a cassette adapter played with such static on my stereo it just was not worth it the pictures were okay but the screen is tiny and fuzzy both features would have been passable if the device performed its main task but it didn t 
these cost with shipping no kidding the shipping charge on these batteries was over amazon doesn t itemize the shipping charges on your order so if you order multiple items you won t know that you re being raped by crutchfield until it is too late ! 
dead after a few months as with some of the other reviewers mine stopped working and blew the fuse in my car for the cigarette lighter i bought a vector brand inverter at wal mart and it is much better 
returning it tomorrow i m trying to replace my iogear miniview micro port kvm switch with a four seat kvm a four port version of the one i already enjoy from the same company seemed like the logical choice turns out it wasn t using the exact same equipment after reading the brief manual i installed it my keyboard never succesfully transmitted a keystroke and my mouse stopped working between switches i followed the manual s troubleshooting suggestions but they didn t change the outcome and now it s going back 
beware not compatible with many hp printers before buying this product you absolutely have to go on the web site and try to find out if they support your printer their web site is absolutely atrocious it is so slow and constantly refreshes so it is almost useless they have a link on the back of the box to a list of compatible printers so go directly to it i have an hp g officejet multi function printer and the setup did not work at all the tech support was useless they kept trying to ask me what brand of computers i had on the network and what my isp was none of this mattered except to the marketing department it drove me nuts after phone calls i finally got hold of a technical support person that confirmed my printer was not compatible separately even if you have a compatible printer you should be aware of a serious bug in the software if you use bit wep security for your wireless network like we do unless your network uses key of you cannot hook the print server into your wireless network there are radio buttons to support the other keys but they do not work tech support acknowledged the issue all in all a horrible experience it s a shame because their wireless routers are almost decent 
not sure the long term quality reliability is built into this tv i would not recommend this tv i purchase the tv it has a brilliant quality picture after a couple hours of running four very large segments on the screen went out making it un viewable panasonics determined the tv needed to be repaired after a two week wait the technician arrived from a local tv repair center the tech recommended that i take the tv back and exchange it for another he mentioned this is a common issue with panasonic s and he has a couple in the shop waiting on parts he said i would have to wait several weeks for parts to arrive from panasonic i loaded it up and back it went i exchange it for another brand new tv with in a week same issue in a different area of the screen long story short in the past three months im loading up the th one tonight to return and try another brand i sense from all of the service techs and panasonic support line this is a common issue nothing i can say i did the tv s had very little use on battery surge monster cable ups system coax surge filters and in a well ventilated area based on my experience i would say look elsewhere 
not good the sound was great but the dvd would lag every seconds during any and all movies it drove me nuts i had to return it 
no vista driver this is a very nice printer and a good upgrade from an inkjet printer it is fast quiet and produces good results however it lacks a vista driver so it no longer works with my upgraded vista computer hp is really dragging their feet on providing a driver 
warning long delays in shipping i ordered the aquos in mid december the shipment has been delayed twice first through the end of january and now more recently through the middle of february given that the date has slid twice extending the delivery of the item by more almost two months perhaps the unit is fine but the practice of repeatedly delaying shipments is annoying at best and deceptive at worst 
flawed device i purchased the garmin forerunner from amazon believing i was buying a reliable piece of gear it doesn t work properly in any built up area i e city where most of us live or areas with too many trees i e where we city dwellers like to go when we leave the city basically it leaves stretches of your running route out but the stop watch carries on ticking so if you re like me and take satisfaction in turning out fast paced runs or what passes for fast paced for us amateurs the will only be a source of frustration it ll time your run perfectly just like any stop watch duh but then leave out some of the distance you ran so that you get a mile for mile average that yo yos in a very suspicious way particularly when you ve put out a steady effort and it ll miss out bits of your course in different places on a day byday basis you ll find yourself adapting the info the device gives you how s that for precision the interval training feature is even worst you dial in some mile repeats with a timed interval and set off at full blast the minutes tick by and the mile never ends ! that s when you find that there are gaps in the mile you re running and you re killing yourself when you ve actually done the mile and should be in your rest period i kid you not i wouldn t dare sell a gps device that works of the time and i m not speaking of heavily built up areas i run in spaces where the closest buildings are at least feet away but this is not the worst of it i though i was getting a well made piece of equipment i live in brazil so i bought it off amazon and a friend kindly brought it over for me from the us in less than year it started turning on off by itself in a crazy dysfunctional way rendering it totally unusable currently it doesn t stay on for more than minute at a time it now runs it s battery flat by itself even though i d been scrupulously careful w it not taking it out in the rain and drying off the moisture sweat after every run religiously some of you may say i should have used the warranty but when you have mailing costs brazil us and if the thing s fixed or replaced customs duty when it gets sent back here you d give up just as i did i m not paying twice for a piece of gear that never worked properly in the first place my conclusion try some other model or even brand i d not lay my hard earned cash on this gizmo again 
the worst dvds i have tried so far i have used three other brands of x dvd rs and none of them have been problematic with my new tivo dvd burner this is the first brand that just hasn t worked these discs were a waste of time shopping for they were a waste of time dealing with failed burns and they were a waste of money i am not even going to attempt to sell the unopened package in the amazon marketplace since it wouldn t be fair to other buyers for your information i have had no problem with sony fuji and verbatim 
lexar media doesn t deliver the lexar media cannot function smoothly with a one gigabyte card from olympus the help site explains how with my mac i can reboot my computer in os classic then download the pictures then reboot in os x not a satisfactory solution i felt screwed on discovering this after the purchase i feel like i simply acquired electronic junk there was no response from lexar when i emailed support which simply added to my feeling of being had 
die mute button die this phone is not all smiles and laughing and gumdrops the mute button makes me crazy oh the phone is all la la la i love its range and clarity as other users report but my face hits the mute button as i talk unaware that my calls are muted conversations break down into two kids with crappy walkie talkies hello hey you there hello i don t suffer from fat face nor am i mashing the handset to my cheek the phone is otherwise excellent but i m going to destroy mine 
a complete disaster i could use this product as the dvi plug did not fit on the dvi outlet of my computer avoid 
don t purchase this printer the installation of this printer went very well however after installing the printer my computer began running extremely slow i checked and it was using of the cpu i stopped all the processes associated with this printer and my speed returned to normal i contacted hp and they said it is a known problem and they are working on it that was six months ago they still are working on it hp s solution is to install the print driver only so you cannot use the scan or fax feature until they write new software for this printer they should have recalled the printer since it doesn t work properly do not purchase this printer 
garmin forerunner not for rural use my kids and i recently purchased the forerunner as a father s day gift for my running husband he was thrilled after reading the product information ! he immediately followed the simple set up directions and away he ran a few hours later ! unfortunately the unit just could not maintain a gps signal and the little bit of information gained was useless and inaccurate we called garmin after a few more unsuccessful runs and the technician on the phone suggested it might be a faulty unit amazon quickly sent a replacement yippee for amazon ! again my husband can not keep a gps signal for the duration of a run the unit registers weak signal times on a mile run ! the final mileage the forerunner has listed for the same five mile distance has ranged from to miles ! garmin tells us that tree canopy can interfere and cause the weak signals we live right on the shore of lake ontario wide open space although we do run on scenic shady roads the bottom line is that the forerunner is useless to my husband garmin admits that it really doesn t function well on shady roads with trees around if you like to run anywhere outside of a barren city street think twice a very disappointing father s day gift returned for the final time 
garbage to back up my personal dvd collection i burned discs on these memorex dvd rs on philips dvd rs every memorex had flaws during playback every philips was flawless i ve been buying memorex for years but i ll never buy memorex again 
viewing angle problem spoils nice alarm clock this clock has a nice design easy to use and doesn t take up a lot of night stand space but in order to see the clock at night when you hit the light button you have to be significantly higher than the clock for some reason the lcd display is not visible when the backlight is on unless you are at least degrees higher than the clock since our nightstand is level with the bed it makes reading the time at night impossible 
specs aren t correct i purchased this and am not impressed note that works with all click wheel ipods isn t true it does not work with photo ipods at least the gb model i m on vacation and had to remove the cover to get it to fit i m ordering a photo dock since i can t see any way to get a cover that is made for the gb photo model if i d known this i d purchased only the stereo cable and the photo dock separately since i already have a charger came with it grr 
not as good as the mhc gx i thought this new model would be a good replacement to my old mhc gx which was a bit big for my new smaller room but i was the mhcec minisystem is truely mini and inferior in quality to the older mhc gx which was around and was well worth it this system does not deliver the watts compared to my older system which used to blow up the room moreover it lacks an auxilary and game sync so you can t hook up your tv ipod or xbox to it 
probably the worst armband ever for the nano i dont know what moron created this but it makes no sense you cannot see the screen of your nano i thought this thing was made for the nano as well as the shuffle but apparently it isnt im sure the rest of it is fine it just sucks you cant see what the hell you are playing or doing if you have a nano 
lovely sound horrible build quality i bought a pair in january and loved them sound is as lovely as everyone describes however there are something seriously lacking in the build quality the soft wires felt flimsy to me when i first opened it but i thought i d just take extra care at month of careful usage the plastic covered wires from earbuds downwards became so weather hardened that i could almost use them as chopsticks and makes it so the earbuds popped out at the slightest motion at months of careful usage the wires had half ripped from the plug which i repaired the best i could with unsightly electrical tape however at rd month the left bud fell completely off i am very disappointed it is one of the best sounding phones i ve ever had ive owned both grado s and s and sennheisers but man they need to do something about making this baby last 
better stay away from low quality cards i considered this card to shoot a wedding because being short on cash it seemed like a good value i researched a few websites and found some encouraging comments so i went ahead and purchased it what a mistake ! i filled up the whole gb with raw jpeg photos i use a canon eos d and when i transferred the photos to the computer used computers and card readers i started getting hardware failure errors after errors and lost over a dozen precious photos needless to say i was majorly furious thankfully i like to be prepared and also carried my old and trustworthy full stars gb sandisk ultra ii from now on i will stick to sandisk cards i ll pay more but i know my photos will be safe 
my plastic band broke folks if you purchased this unit and the plastic band broke call logitech support at once you prove that you have the old model and send it back to logitech they will cross ship you a the new free pulse model which has a high strength carbon spring steel headband you will have to pay shipping but you are getting a great pair of headphones to replace the previous defective model 
great products customer support stinks i am very happy with my meridian color and the other mapsend products i have purchased however at first i couldnt get this product to work i had no problem getting this software to run with xp even without the patch however i couldnt view the basemap i had loaded onto my magellan i tried to address this with the company it has been three days now and they have not even returned my emails customer service for this product is nonexistant i joined the yahoo message board and got a simple answer to my question in about four hours someone posted the answer turns out i just had to go to the menu card utilities and maunually select the basemap i did not know that basemaps dont change automaticaly like the detailed maps do i cannt say enough great things about my experience with my magellan meridian color though navigating through hungary like a pro i didnt miss a single turn i would never recommend any of their products to someone who isnt willing or doesnt have the aptitude to learn about it the magellan meridian series is in my opinion the finest product on the market for what it does portability it provides and is percent upgradable with new software and new maps get you head out of your a thales you have some great products but you are blowing your customer support base with non existant customer support i recommend anyone with a question about softward or the gps join the yahoo groups and post the question there dont waste your time with customer support 
don t buy terrible terrible product like so many others in these reviews i should have read them first ! i can categorically say that this is one of the worst software hardware products i ve ever bought it does not work tech support is useless and you should not even try to make it work i am a computer expert with a great computer and there is absoutely nothing i can do to make this work don t buy 
good idea poor design poor implementation i have had my nuvi for approx to months and overall i am somewhat satified initally i could see no flaws it was perfect i recommend the nuvi to friends and they all bought one first impression features on the nuvi are without a doubt very cool and a step above everyone else now to the not so good stuff which is really a deal breaker for me first after a month and half the unit locked up my friends locked up after weeks of light use once a nuvi locks up it has to be sent back to garmin the reset does not work restarting it wont work nothing we both had the same issues and our units where replaced with refurbished units my second issue involves the suction cup which is insufficent to hold the nuvi properly onto the glass do not use it at all cost every car that it has been placed in the suction cup has failed and the nuvi to my horror has come falling back to earth each time for between to buck you would think they could provide a more secure mount the dashboard mount that i have purchased works well the fm transmitter is not really a feature i would purchase the nuvi for if you live in a city the quality of the audio is poor at best bluetooth hand free communication is cool when it works and is not sending me false signals be very careful the nuvi has a small list of bluetooth enabled phones that it can work with very small if i pair my phone with the nuvi i get continious ghost calls to my nuvi every to minutes where i have to tell the nuvi to ignore or it will just keep ringing for a bit i wish i could continue recommending the nuvi like i once did but with all of the issues it s kind of a lemon i have worked around most of the issues and it s acceptable to use with many of it s key selling points disabled so my recommendation would be to save some money and purchase a cheaper model with just gps the nuvi s bells and whistles are not worth the expense i expect better from garmin really a let down 
lexar gb jump drive sport i have had a mb mb and a gb jump drive sport i love these sturdy and reliable drives i was very dissapointed when i first used the gb model the data transfer rate seems to be extremely slow its slow even when saving a plain text document ! i would buy again only if they improve the speed of this drive 
usb bluetooth receiver worthless the included receiver has very limited range if you already have another receiver i did you might be able to live with this set there is no back lighting on the keys or mediapad lcd the media pad is somewhat useful to use as remote control for itunes and windows media player however the useless lcd can t navigate song titles it simply displays the currently playing title would be great if you could scroll down a list of artist tunes and tag for play 
cheap upon my first use of this cute little flash drive it broke the yellow cover broke off and wouldn t go back on i would not recommend it i returned it 
don t be fooled by amazon they advertise the toshiba df pure flat but they will deliver the toshiba d which is a round tube i had to send it back twice which took more than a month they cancelled my order by saying they are correcting the problem but as you can see they are still trying to bait and switch no wonder the price is lower than other places 
palm pad keeps peeling the left palm pad keep peeling possibly from the uneven heat this make the protection pad a lot less useful than one wouldthink which is most people buy this pack fo 
bad design flimsy toggles junk notice all the happy five star ratings are from people that just bought this mp i have had mine for months i have had this mp since christmas i bought the white for my son at the same time whith in weeks my son s was no longer working at all he had it in his back pack and some how it got crunched enough to never work again i was not happy also in a few months mine started to have issues the very tiny menu button is rediculous and the main toggle was a complete failure for sony i accually removed the cover to the toggle and just moved the joy stick under it to change songs or volume how stupid i am so mad about this mp player i am going to buy a creative v i have done a lot of research this time and i will not buy another sony the hold button that is part of this sliding door never works i find the player dead in my gym bag all the time apparently the door slides over a bit and the player will turn on for hours and than you have a dead player maybe sony should have given us a on off button than this would not happen ! dont do it folks look into other options even my mom s ipod nano is better designed than this joke of an mp player 
hope it works niko won t get help if it doesn t i bought the version which is attractive and worked great for days then the picture died although the sound worked i called niko customer service about times finally i was told there where no service outlets available in my area for repair i then was told i must ship it back to the distribution center in ca at a cost to me of through ups next they received it according to ups on the th of the month but denied having it there until the rd then they said it was delived to them with structural damage and there would be a charge of which they changed to days later i packed it great with lots of padding and ups wouldn t have picked it up if it thought it wasn t now i am out extra costs although ups gave me back for my damage claim without checking it out they then sent me a supposed new replacement that only worked in black and white no color in the picture they offered a rd tv but after the first i screamed and hollered with no success at niko but the tiger direct people were nice enough to return my money after hearing of my problems with the manufacturer ps their remote sucks and you will find the no code works for your cable satillite remotes so you have to use both if you get a tv that works great but if it breaks down dont expect help 
you get what you pay for junk if you do purchase this device make sure you write down the serial number supposedly there s a sticker on the back that has the serial number on it my switch failed after a week since there was no serial number on my device the manufacturer has decided not to provide product replacement even though it s their unit and has their name on it 
junk software the software is confusing and doesn t use the usb port on my magellan gps i can t believe they let such junk software ruin their reputation the program insist on using a old serial communications port well guess what many newer computer don t even bother to include this port since it s so old and nothing works with it look elsewhere 
nice phone but battery died nice basic phone i ve used it happily for two years until the battery died what s the deal with the batteries on new cordless phones my ghz toshiba wonder died after less than years while my trusty at t from mid s keeps on ticking 
no support i paid dollars for a new magellan gps less than a yearand a half ago from boat us and they have already declared it obsolete if you expect any support do not buy magellan 
do not buy this is the worst networking product ever ! constantly crashed and vpn does not work how could they get away with selling this pos 
too many major drawbacks i concur with those who complain about finding music on this player it is cumbersome and timeconsuming moreover the screen is very small in attempting to delete songs the player frequently freezes making it necessary to remove it from the usb port i regret buying this one 
bad product this is the second in six months of these units i have bought only for the specs and especcially the size the battery folds over flat on the back of the screen so it is less bulky however i found out they don t last very long the first unit the hinges just snapped off the second the screen went dead after only days of use 
lr button cell battery great price but that doesn t make a difference if you re sent the wrong merchandise i received lr button cells instead of the lr which are useless to me i tried to get this corrected and decided it is cheaper and less time consuming to just let it go and order elsewhere 
rip off doesn t advertise that you need an ac adaptor i would like to believe that this hub works well but i wouldn t know i bought it to reduce clutter on my desk from all my devices hooking into my powermac i hooked up my printer ipod and digital camera and nothing happened i called targus and they said i needed an a c adaptor it doesn t come with one and doesn t say anything about one in the manual or instructions or their website they said i could get it at radio shack and gave me the info volt amp center positive i ve been to two radio shacks and online they don t carry it i m upset any advice 
a niche product that falls short of expectations unfortunately i found the nexus to be a very niche product i m sure anyone who is researching this product knows by now that it does not allow you to listen to live xm content on the go fair enough since it never claimed to however the idea of this being such a small player only for use of mp content and recorded xm content did not impress me the screen is incredibly small of course this isn t a problem if you are using this player hand held or in a situation where you don t want to see the display anyway however listening to live xm content is entirely different don t expect to have this receiver docked in the home kit a yard away from you and still have the ability to read the screen this also becomes a problem in the car i drive a small compact two door car and had the receiver mounted at eye level on the dash i could see the display okay not perfect but okay my passengers however could not see the display at all before you have the chance to think of any bad eyesight jokes i have had both an xm roady receiver and a sirius audiovox pnp receiver mounted in this same position and never got any complaints adjusting the brightness and contrast didn t do much good the artist text is easier to see than the title text as it is in bold letters having a black and white screen did not help to record live xm content you must begin the recording within seconds of the start in order to get the entire selection this may be great when you hear the first notes of a song you know love and want to record but it s a huge flaw for discovering new music how many of us can decide within the first seconds of a song whether it is or isn t a song we ll want to hear again since xm boasts of having the largest play lists on satellite radio how can you assume that song you just heard on deep tracks will be a song you will ever hear again on xm wait you could ve just add it to your tuneselect so it will notify you next time it is played and you can record it then right nope the nexus does not include a tuneselect nor does it even include a memory option where you can store the artist and song title there is an option titled bookmark though where the nexus and the included napster software will make it easier for you to find and purchase any song you bookmark when you have the nexus connected to your pc however i could find no way to see what songs i bookmarked without using the included napster software the user interface on the nexus could use a lot of help there are way too many buttons to press to find your way around the unit simply going from live xm to recorded mp content can take a while be prepared to wander around aimlessly with this receiver for at least the first few hours of course this receiver does not have the presets that other satellite radio receivers do i did find switching between stations more challenging while driving due to this you can set up a favorites category list on the nexus but i would have liked more options for customization with this category both the nexus home kit included with the receiver and the car kit come with remotes i found the remotes to be pointless though the remotes could have offered an easier way of getting to your favorite channels but there was no such option the number keys on the remote only guided you in accessing a channel if you knew the channel number if you could dock your nexus across the room and see the display clear enough the remotes may have been of more use as for mps you are able to search by artist or song title but not album you just transfered the entire led zeppelin ii album onto your nexus and you want to play it from start to finish well if you have some other led zeppelin songs on your nexus you ll have to find whole lotta love and begin playing there the album title will not be displayed on the nexus screen though and the track number won t be either i m not expecting the nexus to be an ipod but i did find this to be an extreme annoyance note that the nexus can be partitioned to store either xm content and personal content or xm content don t expect to fill gb of your own mp collection the nexus also contains a new technology for xm known as the passport the passport is a small chip that is docked directly behind the nexus in the home or car kit it is not and cannot be physically connected to the nexus the passport is only required for live xm content if you purchase a nexus and activate it with xm you are not actually activating the nexus you are activating the xm passport essentially you can purchase as many passport enabled receivers as you desire and only pay one subscription fee assuming you will only want to listen to live xm content on one receiver at a time of course this is a plus side to the passport technology if you only have the desire to own one nexus it can be a real pain to have to carry around and dock both the nexus and the passport with you every time you go from the car to home the passport s small size could make it much easier to be lost or misplaced as well i have heard that satellite radio companies make it hard for thieves to get away with stealing equipment the victim of the theft just needs to contact the company and they will blacklist the id of the receiver so it cannot be reactivated the passport makes the nexus an easier target since it is impossible for the receiver to be blacklisted due to the id coming from the passport although i am well aware that the car kit is sold separately i feel the need to mention in this review that i was not comfortable with the cosmetics of the car dock the bright silver color of it made it very easy to see regardless of the time of the day or the amount of light coming into my car needless to say i was concerned that this would be a huge theft magnet most satellite radio receivers and mp player car docks are much more low profile and for good reason although i m sure this is the result of stricter fcc guidelines fm modulation is only an option with the car kit unlike previous satellite radio receivers i have owned you can use any fm frequency you desire with the nexus one thing to note is that the fm modulation will not work if you have anything plugged into the line out of the car kit such as a cassette adapter or axillary cables i was very disappointed that no fm modulator is included with the home kit i can t say there is nothing positive about the nexus though loading your personal music collection onto the nexus is very simple you can even simply do a copy paste or drag and drop though windows i used rhapsody instead of napster to load some of my songs onto the nexus and it worked perfectly i also liked that there was an equalizer included of course this is an expected feature of an mp player but it also works with live xm content it doesn t play only mps either i have all of my music library encoded with itunes aac with a vbr of kbps i had no problems with playback of these files overall the nexus does what it is advertised to do i feel the receiver comes short on many features and with it s portability though i noticed the price of these have already gone down substantially since the holidays and some retailers have already stopped carrying them it should be interesting to see if samsung and xm continuing with this design hopefully they will address some issues and create a receiver worth while 
buy some string and soup cans amazon forces you to put at least one star to review an item but these phones don t even earn that our year old kmart phones were wearing out but are way better than these unidens hissing crackling static and the volume of the person on the other end suddenly changes from ok to inaudible we tried various things suggested in the manual they didn t interfere with our wireless internet or anything but we haven t been able to have a single conversation on these always end up at the old corded phone the ringer is piercing and annoying on the loud setting and just annoying at the low volume setting nothing in between at least with the string and soup cans the bad volume is constant these are going back to the store 
won t sync as advertised this is a nice organizer for the price easy to use and has all the basic features but it wouldn t synchronize with outlook on a windows xp computer without the sync feature it s worthless to me i contacted sharp support several times but they could not find a solution despite this they referred me back to amazon for a refund which i can t get because it s been more than days since i received the product im unhappy with the product and i m unhappy with sharp 
memorex forget it dysfunctional software reads as audio file from a fresh disk windows media pops up when disk is first inserted huh mis reads memory states disk has gb s without even being used yet what does not function for backup source windows me why me does not format whatno matter which memorex you use none of them work i tried versions of dvd rwdisk played dvd r s from verbatim but spit memorex out like tobacco this company never ceases to amaze me with the mistakes in their products from cd s to dvd s you want to know the most popular brand on the shelf start by seeing the brand that s missing the most if the shelf is over stocked with memorex then it s pretty obvious people aren t buying them for a reason say your prayers or buy a tent and camp outside of the store waste of money 
what was apple thinking at first i was excited about the mighty mouse the scroll ball worked very well freely scrolling in any direction the side squeeze buttons were a bad idea because they could activate by holding the mouse too tight but they can be disabled easily but the mighty mouse has a much more serious and annoying design problem the scroll ball gets dirty and there is no way to open the mouse and clean it ! the scroll ball collects dirt over time just like the trackball in older mouse but thanks to the brilliant engineers at apple their is no way to open and clean the inside of the mouse without potentially braking it after a while you will loose scroll functionality and have no reasonable way of fixing it within three months of use i could scroll down but not up the apple support people instructed me to clean it by repeatedly wiping the top of the mouse with a cloth this only sort of cleaned it the inside of the mouse was still dirty the scroll ball only works on and off with this method so cleaning it this way is clearly bs im still struggling to understand apple s reasoning with making a mouse that you cannot open apple has made trackball mice for years and each one let you open it to clean the inside when the ball got dirty this is an essential feature i don t understand why apple thinks a scroll ball on top of the mouse would not need to be periodically cleaned exactly the same way if you are buying a new computer from apple i suggest getting a regular two button optical mouse to go with it 
cmc disks are crap i would avoid these discs i have been using these discs for some time doing backups recently i ve had a few problems and decided to look at these further i noticed another review that said that the discs are made by multiple companies under the memorex brand as are others like tdk etc i used to dvd info and noticed that my most recent purchase is made by cmc and i m having problems with some of the discs including burn errors one disk has strange ring in the die i have the nec a burner i also having some trouble playing backups on the same drive on my computer less trouble playing on my sony dvd player just based on this not a clear indication of what you re getting when you purchase i would go with something else these discs are not cheap enough for this reason 
worked great at first when i purchased these batteries i was very pleased but that wore off after a couple of months i don t use my camera all that often but when i do i expect ther batteries to have some charge i recharge them per instructions and they do not hold a charge any longer i know monster makes good products but i am a little disappointed in this one 
needs improvement i bought one of these and returned it a couple days later from an electronics store much more expensive than amazon while it had many qualities i was looking for like the thick protected connector for the ipod instead of a dangling wire this unit just didn t do a good job of holding a charge i followed all the instructions charge it overnight etc but still it would only give and extra hour or so battery life to my gig ipod as tempting as this one is i d say pass and find one with proven ability to hold a charge 
don t buy i ve had this flash drive for months it was working fine until recently now it doesn t even light up i ve had my other flash drive lexar for about years and it still works it is flimsy and at first i liked the case it came with because i could attach it to my keychain now i think the case might have caused it to malfunction i m disappointed luckily i didn t lose much data ! 
cleaning machine didn t repair the machine does fine for quick cleaning of your cd sdvds i can t give a complete review of the product because i only tried to repair dvd and it did not repair it 
wrong item the item is fine it was the wrong dc adaptor for the garmin unit purchased it was listed along the garmin unit as the correct one for the unit it was for another garmin line of products i m sure it worked well on the correct product 
not a good subwoofer this subwoofer is weak very weak my computer subwoofer did a better job than this when the bass was heavy the subwoofer cannot handle the bass the air blow out from the subwoofer make noise rather than giving a solid bass abd it ruin everything 
months then nothing i loved these earbuds for the first two months i raved to my friends i bought pairs for several people at work then about a month later my boss came to me and told me one of the earbuds stopped producing sound i thought it was because she was rough on them but then quickly thereafter my earbuds did the same thing then another coworker had the same problem all withing weeks of each other after purchasing them around the same time i know they re cheap i know they re comfortable but seriously you re going to spend three or four times the amount over the course of a year just replacing them so you might as well buy something slightly more expensive and get more wear from them 
real disappointment i received this unit as a gift rechargeable batteries work well for my portable electronics and i thought this minute charger would be a huge improvement over the overnight charger i own it wasn t like others leaving comments here i found that this charger rejects many batteries i put in it with its annoying flashing red light including brand new nimh batteries all of my batteries rejected by this charger worked just find in my overnight charger i threw this charger in the trash where it belongs 
marketing pinheads triumph i got this as a gift from a friend who should know better but i could easily have been suckered by the weasel words the marketing department plastered on the package the package says hi speed usb but i had mb on a gb cruzer mini that i wanted to transfer to the new lexar jumpdrive firefly the upload to my laptop went smoothly no more than minutes then i took out the cruzer and inserted the firefly in the same usb port and copied the directory i had just uploaded to the firefly via a simple paste it took over an hour i don t know exactly how long since i had to leave before it finished when i got back i decided to do a test copy of the data back to the cruzer the same data only took minutes to download back to my gb cruzer it seems clear that hi speed for lexar means usb about mbps and not usb about mbps im sure the marketing department said why confuse the poor stupid consumers with technichal specs i searched their website to see if there was more information but the suits seem to have veto power over the web designers as well if speed is important to you and with a gb drive it is logical to assume that you are going to have some large files to move then steer clear of this product gb of data will take you on the order of an hour or more to move of course if speed is not important or if you only have usb ports on your machine then the product is fine it works as well as any other flash drive device on the market my main complaint is that without testing it is hard to know that this is only a device 
p ita to get working poor tech support it took me days to get this thing to work with my notebook cannot get it to work with my desktop tech support was no help at all they just had me retrying things i already did if your not a networking wizard do not buy this router newer models don t need the manual setup of this one 
please don t buy a zune i bought the zune around christmas time of i used it on a daily basis and was happy with it early in april it stopped working after spending three hours on the phone with four technicians microsoft accepted my return for repair and sent me a box to ship it to their repair facility two weeks later i received the zune back with a note that the zune was not repaired because the problem it had was not within the warranty limitations they did not tell me what the problem was only that they did not fix it i was more then dismayed i had spent almost with tax and shipping to buy this product i did not abuse it in any way please think twice before buying this product if and when it breaks microsoft will not fix it and you will be stuck with a paperweight

bose gs system this is a great system the sounds is amazing the setup is easy and the configuration of the system with it s small but powerful speakers is fantastic i own a number of bose products and needless to say that this piece of equipment very much lived up to my expectations of a bose system for the first weeks after weeks of blissful enjoyment the honeymoon was over ! first one of the speakers stopped working bose asked us to return the speaker for replacement which we did leaving us with only working speaker for weeks following this replacement another months passed before the second original speaker followed the same fate as the st ! again we were asked to return the faulty speaker for replacement weeks passed and the replacement speaker arrived unfornately it was the wrong make and model ! bose were somewhat apologetic and sent us the correct speaker weeks later a further months of enjoyment followed before the base unit started to falfunction bose suggested fixing our faulty unit but after a protracted phone argument they agreed to replace the entire system at my request ! i was asked to pay for the return postage to bose for the faulty system and again another week wait followed awaiting the replacement the upshot of all of the above is that i have been able to enjoy my system in full working order for months since purchase months ago i have had to make factory returns for replacement exchange and the whole ordeal has cost me ! genuinely superb customer service at this point it is worth pointing out that not a single person from bose has ever been sympathic with my plight and i have been offered no compensation for my trouble and why should they i am a but one small customer whereas they are a huge multinational corporation having just received my replacement system i am understandably keeping my fingers crossed this time although my confidence levels with the product are at an all time low buy at your peril you have been warned 
a boom box not a karaoke machine i m not sure what i expected after i purchased this for fifty some odd dollars and was handed a coupon for a rebate but i wish that someone had informed me before i lugged it all the way home that when you sing into the mic your voice doesn t come through the speaker i m cool with the machine s sound quality when it comes to playing a cd g if i tap the mic i can hear an extremely faint thud so i know it s on but the volume s too low and yes i adjusted the mic controls if you want to sing along which makes this a dinosaur a boom box in the age of the ipod really had to dig through the stacks of machines to find a box that hadn t been opened so when was my first clue doh 
compare to radio shack model although the rs receiver doesn t have tv reception who cares it is the price pll digital speaker dx loc switch andprobably much better quality 
great quality recordings but completely incompatible with macs what s annoying about this solid recorder is that sony hasn t elected to make it compatible with mac it records in a proprietary format which you can t convert out of or even play in mac and it s not exactly easy to convert out of the msw format in windows either requiring multiple different downloads or an initial conversion to aiff with the provided software for a while i had to run virtual pc to get my recordings and that is just way too much hassle i used to love sony s products but now i just wish they would work with other technologies in my workstream sony should look to how apple learned its lesson with interoperability 
received a defective camera dlink bad decision i bought this camera and just when i am out of the country installing it i get the tech support guys tell me to send it back lost my money never again buy dlink this was my first and last dlink product 
a poor choice sounds good except the phone has a permant cord that allows you to move about feet from the wall it probably would never work on a desk counter this is not worth the trouble that it takes to unpack it and not to mention to add the batteries not included 
not good i ordered this by mistake i used them anyway i just have to say i ve gotten better batteries at a dollar store dont waste you hard earned money 
don t buy this piece of junk it s clumsy cumbersome not great quality and a bad idea in addition to that mine will no longer work after very limited use wish i could get my money back 
if you like choppy the quality of the recording was very bad little squares showed up all the time and in dramatic scene changes the whole screen was transitioning little squares like it could just not keep up with the speed i would defintely not buy it again 
not bad but not as nice as i wanted not bad but not as nice as i wanted but i got a refund so no worry 
minimal range fcc license poor value this gmrs way radio claims to have up to mile range however on the back of the packaging there is a statement in very small print that reads maximum range can only be achieved over water or open rural areas under optimum conditions i live in a housing development in fl that has one small hill running through it that small hill and the houses all one story ranch limits this radio s range to less than one mile ! that s no better than a non gmrs way radio ! the lack of range is reason enough to not recommend this radio however the real kicker is that in order to leagally operate these gmrs radios you must pay a fee to obtain an fcc license ! bottom line save your money this radio s longrange capability is incapable unless you live in the flatlands or on a boat 
firewire was defective on mine i bought it and usb was fine but the firewire ports didn t work lost time and money sending it in for warranty service 
works fine but not sport i bought this drive primarily to keep on my keychain and because the cap wrapped around the body and i would not have to worry abut loosing caps this worked well for about months when after the normal wear and tear of taking my keys out of my pocket the cap popped at the point that conects to the key ring i say popped not broke because the cap is made out of rubber like material that i now realise is a glorified rubber band sport indeed i had to resort to keeping the drive loose in my pockets have long since lost the fragile thing and am now wishing i had the frustration of loosing caps for a drive that is sucurely attached to my key ring 
you get what you paid for i was a little disappointed with this item i was expecting the item being more sturdy it seems to me that the turntable is not going to last long it is not a good buy 
not in stock as of although listed as in stock when i ordered it was canceled due to unspecified reasons i assume it is not in stock the item is still listed as available although apparently not for everyone 
very unreliable product the setup instructions for this product are totally inadequate as is the online troubleshooting help with phone support i was able to get the product working but after a few days the h lost communication with the extender after two hours of undocumented procedures with technical support it was working again after two more days the problem reoccured the fix seems to be to reload the firmware and software in both the remote and the wireless extender if it fails again and it is too late to get a refund i will throw it in the trash and go back to ir communication on my h 
not as per my expectation and price i used this phone for four weeks and then returned it the volume was really low and it was really very difficult to hear the person on the other side then the battery started discharging very fast and could not not last for more than minutes off the base instead of buying a new battery i chose to return the phone even if i was refunded store credit and not cash 
gb mp player this was ok for the money decent sound quality however it died on me after just months of use the usb drive still works sometimes but the built in player no longer works i found the controls less than user friendly and difficult to use

tomtom needs to find a new day job i hate this unit with a passion and i sell the things its cheap at most retail place right now and that s what you are getting the one died in hours while plugged in and never turned back on it also directed us to a road that was headed into the pacific ocean there is no road across in the pacific last time i checked it acquired satelites once and then never acquired them again and good luck talking to customer service both i talked to didn t speak english a dreadful unit maybe tomtom could go work at walmar 
don t buy this adaptor as many of the other reviews here have stated the thing falls apart very easily mine worked until i had to move the tivo the little hinged door broke right off now the cable is attached to it with electrical tape even that doesn t do the trick i ve been shopping for a replacement but tivo only recommends this one or a wireless one that forces me to dumb down my wireless security to wep grrrr how could a crappy product like this actually get produced 
the worst brand i ve tried i ve got a lite on dvdrw sohw s burner revision js in my fast g mac running os x tiger and burning with toast titanium although my burner is nominally x capable it only burns at about x in my setup probably due to the slow ata bus it s on ive used a number of different brands of x and x disks both r and r and have had a verification failure rate of less than so few in fact that i often don t bother verifying video dvd s anymore when burning tdk or maxell discs i always verify data dvd s since errors in those are not ignorable but with memorex i ve gotten about failures including a couple of aborted burns ! in one case the disc had a blank band between two burned ones the memorex discs i m referring to have manufacturer id cmc mag am according to videohelp com these are sold under at least different brand names the reviews there are rather mixed which is not imho good enough i have not btw have had any problems with the memorex dvd r discs i ve tried but i stopped using them because one of my players won t recognize the r format 
wouldn t work on my computer the hook up and downloading the software was very simple there was a error problem with the drivers my computer is fairly new with windows xp i called there support and was told to try it on another computer i install it on my neighbors computer and the same happened i sent it back to amazon and credit my account and bought an other brand amazon is so great about handling returns 
leaked in my grundig radio what a mess i got sucked into this deal about a year ago and can say long term risky cells it could be because the clock draws even when the radio part is off but i mnot willing to chance it again 
passable disc terrible panasonic customer service in my opinion i own a ton of panasonic equipment most recently a dvd recorder i was using sony dvd rs with no problems but being a panasonic person i figured panasonic must be better in order to save a few bucks i joined the panasonic club at the panasonic website and ordered a spindle of these same type dvd rs i did this on i made several phone calls and emails to find out where my discs were and believe it or not nobody at panasonic could tell me why they hadn t been shipped then i was promised that they did ship but i never got them after being talked into placing a duplicate order by a panasonic rep i didn t get that order either i finally received one order on they were so poorly packaged that the holder was broken now i finally had my discs guess what they were only x speed the sony discs were x speed and my thermal label printer wouldn t print on them because of the finish i had been assured that i could print on them with a thermal printer i did burn a couple of movies and they worked but i saw nothing special that i can report it gets worse i logged into my panasonic club account and saw two charges i hadn t made one for and one for i fell off the back of my chair to this day nobody has called me but i managed to get some email responses and i was told i would have to watch my credit card that s just what i need you know sometimes you buy a brand and think great things about how wonderful a company it is and then one day you have some dealings and realize how wrong you were im going back to sony and let me tell you amazon customer service blows away just about every company i ve dealt with sorry about the preposition i should have bought on amazon 
jvc wireless stereo headphones what i don t like about these is the way you have to position them in the cradle to make sure they charge i bought these for my elderly father and he s having a hard time positioning them correctly and if they re not positioned correctly they won t charge 
okay the only reason i purchased this was because it was a cd amfmweatherband it actually doesn t have the weatherband capability 
nearly worthless save yourself the aggravation and just run a phone line i purchased this to add an extension phone line into my bedroom because of old wiring in the house the phone jacks in my bedroom stopped working and no dial tone was available while i use a cordless phone with the main base in the other room i needed a phone jack so my tivo could dial out and get programming information when set up the two units would be in separate rooms with a hallway between them i purchased this unit from a store after the clerk assured me the range and quality was good enough that i could use it almost anywhere in my house after a lot of effort i find the unit to be nearly worthless the range is very limited i made sure that the only obstructions between the transmitter and base were the two walls between the two rooms and nothing else furniture electronics etc were in the way yet there was no dial tone i moved the receiver so that only a single wall was between the two units and i did get a dial tone but had such a bad signal that voice calls would be painful to listen to i couldn t imagine using it with an electronic device like a modem or tivo that sends data i got the best signal when both devices were in the same room and within to feet of each other needless to say with that kind of configuration it s easier and cheaper to just run a long phone cord along the baseboard 
died suddenly repair impractical lost my stuff one day it just stopped working i got the dreaded orange and green flashing lights of death the contents of the file space were un recoverable and i ended up just pitching it after extensive attempts to revive it apparently this is yet another one of the bad products that apple likes to keep hush hush 
pass on this one purchased this for use during travel but screen is not viewable outdoors and barely viewable indoors reception is poor unless outfitted with the xium antenna the only positives include rugged handsome case and jacks for external devices including external antenna this would have been a much better product if they had included a cowling for the screen not sure how it can be packaged and advertised for use outdoors when it performs so shabbily under those circumstances 
adapter card i had trouble with installing the firewire port i did not get any help with the company 
electronic service plan with amazon the time starts ticking when the item is purchased not when it ships ! the gps that i bought will not ship for another couple of months and i agreed to purchase it a month ago so with the one year manufacturer s warranty or whatever and the three months or more one is actually being delivered less than expected 
does not work i tried dvds with different dvd writers and still doesn t work this stuff is junk in addition the manufacturernever sent the rebate don t buy anything from velocity 
run don t walk away from this thing i have tried three of these mybooks and each one has the same problem file errors the problem is it turns on and off by itself and if you leave it on and then decide to copy files over it will copy the files and then won t allow you access to them ! it is a real piece of garbage western digital should be sued over this useless hack of an external hard drive don t trust your data to this because you will be sorry 
not worth the i recently bought my second of these the first had a digital tuner you had to get used to the feel after about a year of use one earphone went out the one i just bought has an analogue tuner and it is extremely hard to get any station other than the very high powered pop and around here country stations the tuner requires extremely small movements to move way up the dial i can t believe sony is charging for this cheap piece of junk 
auto feeder does not work well we ve had this machine for years and the automatic feeder started its problems whenever we try to use it for muliple page faxing or copying sheets would get stuck together this is very annoying because it is extremely painful to track which pages got faxed copied or not this is the most annoying feature and because of it i m not recommending it 
causes high cpu utilization according to sysinternal s process explorer both hwi hardware interrupts and dpc deferred procedure calls tend to run to each while this card is installed both drop to under once it s removed both remain under while using another manufacturer s usbbased b wifi adapter i m given to understand that such high hwi and dpc rates often indicate buggy drivers but i ve found no useful driver update info on d links web site last i looked that other b adapter btw gives better throughput than this bg card of d links 
monster cable is misleading research before making a purchase first of all the cable is very difficult to install it s rigid and not flexible after i connected my cable box and my lcd hdtv with this monster cable hdmi my service provider time warner cable told me that they don t support hdmi i should use the component cable that comes with the cable box well i already opend the box and it s too late to return every now and then i get a message on my tv saying you can not use hdmi cale please use the component cable to watch tv i had to turn my tv off and on to get rid of that screen some hd channels volumes are very low i have to turn to the loudest in order to listen has it anything to do with the cable time warner won t care the sales guys from circuit city said it s must to get bla bla bla in order to watch best high definition channels this hdmi cable is one of the recommendations i m too naive to trust them i should have researched more before making a purchase i don t like the cable at all sooner it ll destroy either port the cable or the tv 
check compatibility thought this would work with my new ipod shuffle but no super deal if you have the right ipod i offered the two items as give aways to co workers but i had a long line of folks who tried them on their newer ipods and failed to get them to work if you have an older ipod you re likely to succeed with these 
speaker feature flakier than courtney love i bought this premium priced product because it has both built in voice mail and speakerphone the latter was the key feature i sought well it works intermittently just enough so you can tell occasionally that it s on but infrequently enough that you can t actually use it to carry on a meaningful conversation it reminds me of the can you hear me now commercials id rather live with courtney than own this piece of junk one more day all the other complaints from others are absolutely true as well ugh do not buy this product ! 
no antennae poor customer service i ordered the cisco aironet the other day and after it arrived set it up and couldnt get a wireless signal i called customer support and was told i would be called back by a technician which obviously the first person was not within an hour we waited and got online to try to figure things out turns out that in very small print on an obscure documentation page of the it says at the very bottom that two external antennae are needed for the gh wireless bg to work i was even more disappointed to find out that the required antennae were available online for only a piece which makes cisco look really cheap for not including such a small but vital item with a router although it took an astonishing twelve hours for customer support to get back to me since i registered my complaint with them they have been very helpful i really hope that they improve their web site it really is not that helpful since you have to weed through pages of documentation before you can even begin to find information you need i still haven t used this router since i m waiting for the required antennae i had to order somewhere else cisco routers are supposed to be good but as a warning to you the potential customer be aware that you need to purchase external antennae with this product my initial experience with customer service was pretty disappointing 
trash i bought this unit and thankfully found out that it belonged in the trash before the return period had expired it did not accurately pick up my position anywhere and also had problems picking up signals i actually punched in miami and the unit came back with address not found several times trash i would not recommend it to anyon 
decent but not what i would consider good for cds dvds well the quality is really that great the zipper felt like it would break off if i pulled it a bit too hard as for some commenting on the smell yup it smells it smells a bit like chemicals i assume that is because the outside of the case seems to be made with nylon or something as for cds dvds i don t think it s impossible to get in there but i wouldn t recommend you put of your most preciouse cds dvds in there as it gets really cramped right now i am using mine for copies of old software old mp backups etc basically stuff that i wouldn t be worried if it got hurt the pages are too short from the edge to the inner part of the binder and that is what makes it hard to fit in there the case get s really cramped and you aren t able to flip through the pages very easily i give it a based on the fact that it is usable and i got mine from amazon for a really great price imho i wouldn t pay more than five bucks each for these i didn t when i purchased and that is why i got them 
just working apart from the fiddly nature of the charger it does all it says apart from the one main thing if you intend to have it connected to your car whilst driving the charger is not shielded thus a ridiculously loud hum can be heard through the sound system as it charges for the sake of a cheap shielding mechanism to prevent this problem could be easily solved buy at your own peri 
expensive not good quality i bought it and used it for two days returned it on the third day very expensive for what you get the system does not come with an amplifier where you can adjust the sound the surround sound is non existant and for you don t get that much returned it and changed for a sony dav dx which totally rocks ! dont buy this you will be very dissapointed 
poor product bad since purchase and no customer service this product is not recomendable in no way there is no way to return it without aditional charges it s bad to begin with sent back since dec and there is no way to track it i could bet on the day return is going to pop up if a policy such as this exists this product should no be part of amazon s list it only creates insatisfied customers for penny cash 
crappy i use this type of flash drive for my research and more than half the time i can never view the images on the computer or get the flash drive to work not worth buyin 
very sad about this the card worked fine for my son s graduation and a family holiday but became corrupted during my brother s wedding and i lost all the photos from that event i still can t believe it happened if you have an ipod or other remember to back up your photos as soon as you can to try and avoid this 
doesn t cut it i bought the product with the intention of printing from across my house the room i m printing from and the room with the printer aren t separated by any walls so there shouldn t be a problem checked the manuals and it said there was a range of m took the measurement and found it to be only feet about half the distance that was advertised i reconfigured their positions and still nothing would work the printer didn t have a problem as it s brand new and ideally should work but nothing good has come i resorted to the old fashion usb way another miss by hp 
terrible i purchased a cd player to play cds out of the box it wouldn t work then i was told it couldn t be returned it took three weeks before a shipping label arrived and that might make it too late to get credit as it had to be returned in days i sent it back as soon as i was in receipt of the label i protested through my credit card company i am not pleased and will probably never use amazon again not a good start to this relationshi 
don t bother microphone input generates high noise i tested the product with both my desktop and laptop and the recordingfrom the microphone generates tons of static its simply not acceptable just no way that i can use it to talk through voip 
sandisk sddr mobilemate good luck the reader didn t read my g minisd i have another reader that does so i dumped the mobilemate and took the lost 
maybe i got a bad one my experience i got this from fm not amazon the dvd player rattled pretty loudly sometimes but not always when i put in a dvd i tried several the picture quality wasn t all that great and the screen got a horizontal line thru the middle after a short time that would not go away plus one of the other reviewers was dead on about the remote the layout makes no sense at all ! very poor human engineering imo i brought it back to the store for a refund i saw the same model under the emerson name for lt at wm but was hesitant to buy it 
charger is fine transmitter is awful there is absolutley nothing wrong with the car charger it works fine however the fm transmitter has problems for me the connector is not long enough to connect through many of the protective cases made for zune so you have to take it out of the case the signal is very weak and did not work for me in either of my cars i ended up buyin a cassette adapter which worked much better and there was a better sound quality 
annoying and difficult to use the user interface was horrible the product documentation was even worse i still can t figure out how to perform a regular scan no ocr this was poorly designed poorly supported get some other scanner this one is impossible 
design both very good and very bad i wanted this product to work very badly it has an elegant simple design and finally a transmitter that makes use of the radio s rds function it also is simple looking enough to discourage theft since it appears to be a simple charger the bad is very bad first the sound quality was very bad in the northern california area this is both in dense and thinly populated areas there always seemed to be interference whenever there was a break in the music second the plug kept popping out of the cigarette lighter i ve used other car adapters and they always feel secure this plug was poorly designed i would be listening to great tunes when pop i am interupted by loud unpleasant static i gave this stars as opposed to zero because there is a chance that the plug will work in your car and a chance that there will not be static in your area if that were the case this adapter would be great otherwise this product fails in the simple areas that would make this remotely useful 
drive itself is great u software troublesome as a sysadmin i am administering windows linux and mac pcs all day and need this device to go between them all seamlessly pros lots of room for data after much headache i uninstalled u and the drive now works on all platformscons the u caused trouble from the start confuses linux machines i wasn t expecting u to work of course but it is supposed to appear just like a data drive on non windows pcs instead it just failed failed to work on a mac failed to work on vmware windows images failed to work on windows pcs where the pc has some policies that prevent full access to the pc ie most work corporate environments other cons are that it doesn t fit well onto my keychain it comes with an extremely flimsy cord to attach it to things so flimsy it was immediately obvious that it would break on a keychain with the way keys get used throughout the day so i ditched the cord and fished the keychain loop through the actual plastic hole on the end of the key but it s too small to allow for free movement so it is always tangling up my keychain the lid appears to be getting looser the more i use it too ucom has the uninstaller product it works fine and now the drive acts just like a gb plain data drive i recently bought of these for distribution at work we unpack them and immediately remove u before handing them out it would be a support nightmare otherwise my advice is to buy a drive without u or similar technology while you still can 
it would it being great if d link implemented raid better i recently bought this product and returned almost immediately after i find out that d link implementation of the raid was very unreliable this unit would it being great if you can start with drive and set is as raid enable so in the future you can buy another drive switch to raid and the device automatically knows to reformat only the new drive and start mirroring with drive instead the device only let you run single drive configuration while you had only one drive and if you want to add another drive in the future as raid it will reformat the old drive so you will lost all your data unless you backup first most people buy this device as storage because they don t have more space on their desktop pc so it make no sense to force the user to backup what they had stored on drive because they won t have were to put it if you don t care about raid configuration then the device may work for you because you will be running or drives independently on single drive configuration however be aware that every time you upgrade your firmware the device warns you that you should backup your data because it will reformat the drives what in the world d link was thinking the device format your drives using linux ext file system so you are not comfortable with this avoid this device there are free drivers on the internet to allow windows to mount ext drives so if something happened with the device you can recover your data from windows but so far these drivers don t work under windows vista and are not recommended computer users that are not familiar with file systems or partitions 
very disappointing overall my experience with this mouse pad is very disappointing i had this mouse pad for more than a month and my experience with it is average to very poor the only positive is it is a very sturdy mouse pad i have used an optical mouse and a laser mouse on this mouse pad both were manufactured by microsoft the optical mouse works ok on this mouse pad but the laser mouse micro does not work at all although i have not tested mice from other manufacturers i believe this is something new buyers should be aware of before they spend any money on this good looking mouse pad 
the worst phone i ve ever owned this phone system is now in a box where all my old and failed electronics go you could be feet from the base and all handsets still sounded scratchy like an old cell phone i have a ghz and a mhz phone in the house and they work like a champ and have been where the uniden base was so its not the location if i could give this product a zero star i would ! 
acronis disk director works great for partitioning a hard drive but when it comes to adding another operating system i ve been pulling out my hair the directions are vague and the customer service stinks everything is done with email and if you want to talk to someone it will cost you for a one time occurance check it out at www acroniscom look around before you buy if i would have i would have never had bought this product 
buy the cheap ones using the component input on your tv can make a huge difference in picture quality but the differentce between the lower priced monster cables and the most expensive monster cables in not noticeable save yourself and buy the cheap ones 
they denied the rebate request what a rip off your rebate submission has been received unfortunately your rebate is denied for the following reasons request postmarked after close of program deadlinerequired postmark before actual postmark there was absolutely no cut off submission deadline given except the purchase by date and submit within a certain time after receiving purchase all were followed to the ti submitted the rebate immediately after i received the merchandise from amazon give me a break i ll never touch another thing from viking except with a pole if it was not so piddling an amount this would be worth reporting to fcc but the state of customer protection in this country make you jump through even more hoops probably for nothing more heartache just forego rebates send viking back to the boat and purchase another brand 
poor quality product was missing ac adapter couldnt even plug it in after hassling with it and trying to rummage around to find an ac adapter to work with it i gave up and packaged it up and returned it instructions and documentation are horrible would not recommend this product 
subwoofer has no power literally i have been very disappointed by these speakers i have the series iii ones while the treble sounds fine perfectly clear this system has no bass ! my husband recently bought a set of computer speakers and subwoofer and his setup sounds x better than mine because the subwoofer feeds power off the stereo reciever it s hooked up to and does not have its own direct power supply or amplifier it literally lacks power this subwoofer is the biggest joke ever ! i can barely hear the bass on most things even with the volume cranked up bose products are extremely overrated and overpriced do not waste your money buy something worthwhile for a fraction of the price ! and make sure the subwoofer has its own amplifier direct line to outlet 
avoid this product i have had the unfortunate experience of dealing with of these at the office each one is plagued with the activity lights flashing constantly when there are no other wireless devices in range flashed to the latest firmware i tried multiple locations even going as far to bring one home and see what happened i live the middle of no where so i am sure there are not any wireless devices around also the fact that neither a or g would keep a constant m connect sitting the laptop foot from the router and the speed would fall back to lower connect speeds constantly after trying multiple wireless lan cards and multiple laptops i can honestly say this ap is a piece of garbage and i would not recommend it at all 
terrible product i bought this product to replace a previous hp all inone printer i had this is by far the worst printer i have ever owned it does not like photo paper it is unreliable and it goes through ink quickly as the cartridges are tiny and overpriced do yourself a favor don t buy this product 
review of amazon process not the product hello i purchased the avic d xm and the ipod kit from amazon i then went to my local installer and confirmed with them that they could install all three devices and still allow my factory rear entertainment center to function in the new setup after hours they failed i decided that i d return the items because i needed to get an alternative gift before christmas and i didn t have time to find another way to get it installed i was able to return the d but the gex pxmt and the ibii are not returnable it turns out that amazon brokered my sale to three other companies that have differing return policies had i realized that amazon would sell me something that i can t return i would have purchased elsewhere at this point i will never purchase anything else from amazon ever again 
not as good as my camcorder s internal mic perhaps this would work well in an area with alot of noise such as a sports game but i wouldn t recommend this for any other reason in fact i returned this mic because it wasn t as good as my panasonic gs s internal stereo mic i did identical tests with this mic and with my camcorder s mic the atr did pick up better on voice clarity and depth when in close range but it brought in too much outside ambient noise and the cable makes alot of noise ! it s hard not to rub against the cable with your fingers when it s mounted on a small camcorder the bottom line you may want to do research on a more expensive mic like the rode videomic i hear it s great yet haven t tried it yet i guess you get what you pay for 
nice appearance but break easily i received a box of these cases and about out of were broken upon arrival because they are so fragile if they are handled carefully they work well but the hinges are easily broken unfortunately not a lot of selection on amazon for this type of clear cd case 
terrible product i had to continue to send back this product because it wouldn t work i ended up going through before i gave up entirely this product is not reliable and i didn t even want to give it star 
this phone does not work with voip this phone seems to have great potential but does not work with voip internet phone this is a known issue perhaps because siemens sells a voip adapter version of this phone you use that phone with the built in voip adapter i loved the color display and the phone number list was easy to work with and easy to use drat that it wouldn t work with my voip setup which is why i bought it also watch for steep return restock charges it was cheaper for me to give this phone as a gift than to return it 
texts and pictures on the labels smear ! i just bought these matte labels when i printed a photo i noticed that photos come out at the ultra lowest quality and the worst part is that everything printed on these labels smudge when fingers are lightly run over the labels has anyone experienced this please share your story 
broken item item arrived broken amazon reimbursed the cost they have not reimbursed for another electronic item that was ordered at the same time both arrived in an unusable manner they have not replied to my request about the other items status will not buy electronics from amazon again 
not as good as the mhc gx i thought this new model would be a good replacement to my old mhc gx which was a bit big for my new smaller room but i was the mhcec minisystem is truely mini and inferior in quality to the older mhc gx which was around and was well worth it this system does not deliver the watts compared to my older system which used to blow up the room moreover it lacks an auxilary and game sync so you can t hook up your tv ipod or xbox to it 
noise canceling or music amplifying stylish comfortable good sound quality and utterly useless at noise cancelation great for allowing one to conveniently eavesdrop on seat side passenger conversations while listening to your favorite tunes and you ll be sure to not miss any important safety instructions on your next flight perhaps there s a reason there was no floor demo set out of the box i suggest you insist on this sure turning on the noise cancelation sliding button would seem to somewhat reduce ambient noise but as far as i can tell the only thing it does is slightly amplify the music volume 
mechanism so loud you can hear it over the film i recently purchased this model from a source outside amazon it is easily unlocked to play all region dvds and the picture quality is excellent however the unit would only work using the s video connector not separate connections the spinning of the dvd itself was ridiculously loud 
great if you like being on the receiving end of a hot poker seriously this is great ink if you have a lexmark printer especially since nothing else will work in my printer anyway lexmark has a reputation that seems deserved from my limited one year experience basically they are known to sell cheap printers they do and charge high prices for ink for those printers which of course you need great quantities of moreover this ink does not last very long ok that s just my experience decide for yourself and if you are already owned by lexmark i mean you own a lexmark printer then you have to buy this ink so there you go enjoy it it s fine ink 
disappointed this cartridge does not fit my hp c as advertised the color cartridge that accompanied it did however 
don t waste your time i purchased this yesterday after only using it for minutes i have decided to take it back it will stay attached to my zune it has too much static when there is little static the sound is not clear 
it didn t work the radio for the boom box worked the cd player did not work i had to return it to be repaired or replaced i do not have it back yet 
wrong adapter amazing i read all the reviews and assumed the problem with the wrong adapter was resolved since reviewers have complained since i ordered the casio ctk keyboard clicked on the recommended power adapter and trusted the folks at amazon knew which model i would need wrong it doesn t fit since we bought this keyboard to travel this summer it has been very inconvenient and we haven t had time to resolve it 
arrived broken it s still usable for the purpose i bought it for for waking up a year old for school but it is disappointing that it arrived broken the light for seeing the clock at night does not work and the increase time button for setting the time or alarm does not work so i always have to set everything from the decrease time button my mother sent it to me over seas so it s a real hassle to try to return it so it will do for now at least my child has a clock to wake him up for school in a few years i will order him a better one 
stopped working after using twice mp after spending hours downloading songs the player quit on me tried replacing batteries did all the trouble shooting nothing i purchased it january and it is now past the return to amazon please someone tell me how to get my money back 
piece of junk does not consistently work ! i have a toshiba a win xp pro and sometimes this works but usually it doesn t lately it either works perfectly or it gives me a blue screen error and restarts the computer it used to have problems where i would restart the computer and it would say card not found which forced me to reload the driver but lately it s just been giving me a blue screen i have used pcmcia cards before and never once had any issues dlink needs to support their faulty product with a new driver ! bad customer service i will never buy a d link product again ! 
microsoft bw wireless notebook laser mouse one of the worst pieces of hardware i ve purchased in the past two years short on features functionsshort on range suggest buyers consider logitech 
doa twice don t buy these they are total garbage they won t turn on at all i followed all of the instructions and still nothing avoid this 
poor quality the mouse works fine the keypad is pretty much crap the rubber anti skid things on the bottom came off the first time i used it and the plus and minus keys no longer work i haven t even tried all of the keypads functions yet to see if they work as i ve only had it about weeks i m returning it i do like however that both the mouse and keypad have an auto off feature after a short period of not being used 
lots of bad burns i had so many bad burns with my first spindle that i had to ask for an exchange the new spindle had at least bad burns too also the edge of the disc wasn t rounded but had a sharp lip on the underside never again will i buy memorex discs dvd cd or otherwise 
woof the radio dials are not accessible when the radio is in the case i cut slits in the case with a knife to be able to tune the station and volume when in the case i can t believe the case didn t come this way and that s just the start of the problems the dials are fussy and it s not easy to carry this radio even in the case without nudging the dial to the point you must remove it from the case if you haven t cut any slits in it and re tune your station in minneapolis st paul wcco am radio comes in fine in a suburb miles from downtown but that station has howitzer power forget about tuning in virtually any other am station in the city granted i didn t buy this to listen to fm or shortwave it was to be an inexpensive radio to listen to baseball with the minnesota twins having moved from wcco that won t happen as this radio is incapable of pulling in the twins new am radio home or any othe am signal in the area that s really difficult to imagine being other radios i own even chintzy giveaway promotional radios can pull in most any station in the metro area if this is an example of grundig s work i d say they rely more on their brand name than their products 
dont even think about it i had been using philips adapter that i got from walmart and was quite satisfied with it until the wire broke when it got entangled i bought this one just because it was maxell and i had to make in order to qualify for free shipping but the moment i inserted it in my stereo i realized my mistake it sounded terrible the very same day i went to walmart and picked up philips adapter once again you can try others as well but dont even think about this one 
too small for most computers i would not recommend this unit for most computers as the battery is too small to provide reasonable runtime under a w load it only lasted minutes while the back ups es lasted almost minutes the es is only slightly more expensive but provides much longer runtime in my opinion this ups is only good for very small loads less than the average computer 
looks are deceiving it looks great and has a great price but when i got this one in the mail and keyed in the code it worked to turn the t v on and off but after i threw away the box and everything and then tried to actually use it to change channels and change the volume it would not work the company which sells this is very good and gave me a credit for my purchase i will do business with them again 
not practicable in windows xp in non administrator accounts like most device drivers the turtle beach specific driver needs to be installed with administrative rights nothing unusual however when a non administrator logs on as is good security practice the driver says is needs to be reinstalled which is not possible without administrator rights catch not usable for me as i don t use the administrator account except for special purposes a security best practice without the turtle beach specific driver it works as a generic usb sound card with the default microsoft driver no reinstallation required no special sound effects then so not worth the extra price premium over a generic usb sound card too bad the poor software implementation ruined a good piece of hardware as when it works it sounds great 
nothing but problems from the time this unit was removed from the box it has been a nightmare this main problem is each and every record both s lps skips at the end on the last track my records friends and even neighbors i returned the unit to teac and the seemed quite good about the turn around with the repair in which they claimed to have replaced the enter turntable assy but it is doing the same thing again right out of the box i would not recommend this monste 
in review of the seller i placed an order for this kingston memory stick only to have my order cancelled without explanation very lousy customer service 
disappointed i brought this at the same time i got my ipod mini the latter s great the case smells very bad a chemical smell very strong also the part that covers the screen s scratched im not returning it because i dont have time if idid i definitely would like people already mentioned it does also bulk to the ipod and wont fit into the belt clip the screen part does attracts lints making the screen not as clease as it can be without the case 
ok performance but can be dangerous to be short the performance is less than great but ok but i can live with that since i have dozens of them i don t care if it runs out faster but what i couldn t stand if that it also set my charger on fire since one of them leaked i couldn t imagine what would happen if i didn t come to my desk in time 
low price low quality no technical support this transcend gb x cf card was purchased along with a gb x and they have not failed yet but the transcend gb x cf card that i purchased a month earlier failed and i lost some very important images i was using it in my canon d i tried several different software recovery programs to retreive the images and none of them worked i have tried to contact transcend technical support through their website but they failed to respond i do not recommend transcend cf cards this experience has taught me to pay a little more and stick with the proven brands sandisk lexar and kingston 
do not buy this product i should have read the reviews if i had i would have known this product does not work on intel based macs what a waste ! 
cheaply made look for something more solid when i got this product out of the box i hadn t seen one in a store before i was surprised by how lightweight and cheaply made it appeared particularly at the price they charged about at the time the box i received was also missing the insert for the ipod nano and the nano won t sit securely in the ipod socket without it i returned this product and for about the same price i got a much more solid and better sounding boom box with an auxiliary input jack that allows me to play songs from my nano though admittedly without the remote that allows you to scroll through your ipod songs this wouldn t be a bad ipod speaker set if you could get it for but at it s dramatically overpriced 
love hate usb is wonderful pci cards are very easy to install unfortunately the card is odd shaped and does not fit well into all pcs 
very disappointing not only is the microphone not mac compatible as stated in another review unfortunately posted after my purchase the entire headset is incompatible with some cellphones as well with three different model nokias as soon as the set was plugged in enhancement not supported flashed on the screens never had a problem with other headsets it would have been helpful to have had a list of compatible devices to view before purchasing i ll just have to pass these on to a pc using friend and hope they have more luck 
brother never again i was with hp for years needed mfp read all reviews here and decided that mfc dn will be a good choice other option was hp it has everything i need copier network print scan fax easy setup i am in it for years everything was almost perfect the only complaint you need to keep in mind it eats watts when starts printing light could flash it was ok until i reached pages mark it start printing small dots every no problem need to clean everything per my experience and confirmed on brother s web site cleaned it was the biggest mistake all outputs were with tons of small dots all around the page called support times after few hours of troubleshooting they advised me to replace drum hey its only pages nowhere close to promised ! after i mentioned it they offered me discount on it what s about warranty sorry i spoke to supervisor he explained that support in philippines can t do it the only option to call usa office i replaced drum now counter shows around pages and i have same problem again hey i heard this before never say never still as of today i would never never buy brother printer mfc again 
more development work to be done by pharos yes it s inexpensive when compared to some alternatives but the devil is in the details these suppliers all differentiate themselves on the software and feature set since the underlying chips tend to be common so this is where you will want to focus when comparing things i like about this system the hardware is well done though the cable to the receiver could be a little longer the option to view satellite positions in their software is really neat integration with contacts for route planning is nice however i just returned my pharos system for the following reasons it crashes my dell axim x pda and this is apparently a known issue on investigation the vendor s web site has a faq on what to do in this situation unfortunately this is not a rare occurrence and it is clearly a software bug another bug in the navigation software showed my distance as a bird flies increasing to the destination while i was actually headed towards it on the interstate prescribed by the routing software after about minutes of this it abruptly fixed itself as if nothing had ever gone wrong the route calculation is so slow as to be unusable and this is on a mhz dell axim x with a ton of memory a very highest performance device map inaccuracies are such that it occasionally indicates the user is off route while on a major highway or the interstate i think that this is a case where map position coordinates for the roadway are at least to feet in error maps have to be manually loaded from region to region even if present in the memory the user has to instruct the software to use it this is a big hassle and one that is not tolerable while driving generated routes are terrible in town and out and i found myself using a paper map for the sake of efficiency instead of this system as an example of how ridiculous things can be the device instructed me to exit interstate in the middle of nowhere then immediately get back on the highway this was not related to a map inaccuracy the exit ramp stop sign and entrance ramp were exactly where they were indicated to be but the instructions made no sense there are also a number of product features and tweaks that should be addressed in my opinion a route builder tool is needed where the user is presented with route options or can constrain the routing engine to use a certain highway or road set without real time traffic information school zone locations etc this would be necessary even if the routing engine were good and wile not a panacea this would also speed the calculations up as a side effect the display should auto center when one zooms drawing a zoom box on the screen only instructs the unit what scale you wish to see rather than zooming in on a specific region the map view tool is weak making the process of transferring maps to your pc and pocket pc slow and tedious there should be an option to adjust the amount of detail shown on the map low medium high i saw situations at both extremes that i would have liked to adjust actually needed to in one case it would also be nice to have basic trip computer features like eta at destination as well as waypoints or road changes average speed a speed profile etc the unit should be able to store and upload actual detailed routes to pharos web site for analysis this would allow them to tweak their routing engine to a point of usability and perhaps generate rules or algorithms that would allow it to finish calculating before you arrive conclusion at its current stage of development this is a toy at best i don t what alternative to suggest yet but would like to hear from you if you have a good one best regards ro 
button presses not registering i bought this for an exam with restrictions about what kind of calculator i could have in my prep work i noticed a few times that button presses weren t registering on the screen might also have explained some of my answers but as luck would have it in the exam it was happening often i was on the alert for it though so it might have always been the case my fingers were feeling the click though anyway a calculator that can t be relied upon to register button presses is useless 
not network ready the printer works great as a usb printer a fax machine and copier it may as well not even have a network port on it the networking driver will find the printer but then it goes back to searching fora printer and this loop continues till you give up i can t tell if thr network scanning works because of the above driver problem i can tell you that a dell works great as a network printer network scanner fax copier we have of these and we tried this hp and i would not reccommend it to anyon 
extremely disappointing after having used the real eb being an enthusiast of the eb and already owning a softwareversion and an old paper edition i was very thrilled by thepossibility of having access to the eb on my pda as well nomore would i be left musing about a strange place nameon a book read in the cafe or wondering what the currency ofa country might be called it was a disappointment then to find that the concise in the name of the product is aneuphemism for grossly abbreviated many articles do little morethan state the obvious about their topic moreover one wonderswhy this needs to be the case as current sd cards have becomecheap and have enough capacity to contain a lot more text isit the desperate need for claiming illustrations 
stay away from this device i read the other reviews some glowing others well not so glowing the price was right rebate so i thought i would take a chance i read the other reviews so i have no one else to blame but myself first off i am only interested in playing videos from my computer so i have no idea how well the image viewing or mp playing works i also notice other people reviewing this product had all kinds of problems with wireless connections my house is fully wired with cat therefore i am using this product wired not wireless i was able to get the device connected to my network and reading files from the media server within minutes of opening the carton so far so good the first thing i did was check for updates an update was found and updated successfully i then had the dsm look for media servers it found the tversity server right away and i was able to see the contents listed this unfortunately is the end of the good news it s all went downhill from here neither server tversity or the dlink were smart enough to view a folder of vob files as a movie they listed them as vob vob etc so for example i clicked on my casablanca folder i would then need to click on vob to start the movie when vob ended after about minutes it did not go to vob i needed to use the remote and manually select the next item to play arrrgghh p os thing as another review stated the ff simply does not work properly oh sure if you press ff the movie will fast forward but there is no way to stop it if you press play while the movie is ff wding the movie starts to play from the beginning of the current vob more arrrrgghh this alone is enough of a nuisance to return the device which i will be doing first thing in the morning my final advice to any prospective buyers s t a y a w a y my final advic to d link great idea but your product absolutely sucks oh one more thing someone mentioned that their tech support was very freindly yes the two ladies i spoke to were both very friendly their english was terrible guess which county you call for tech support oh come on just one guess it also sounded like each of the tech support personnel are sitting shoulder to shoulder to one another i could hear at least other tech support people communicating with their clients which made it very difficult for the lady helping me she needed to ask me to repeat myself over and over sheesh i must have read my phone number to her at least times before she got it right one last interesting tidbit on the packaging they mention nero recode ce so i went to the nero site to check it out nero has a list of supported media players listed and you know what d link is not one of them i will return this d link junk and purchase one the nero certified product instead i bow my head in shame as i had read the reviews but i bought the product anyway 
very disappointing i bought this unit for my wife and we are very disappointed for one thing this does not have the resume feature that means that when you are watching a movie and have to turn it off when you power up again it does not remember where you were in the film this feature is greatly missed the other problems are that the screen occassionally goes black and or the picture freezes the only way to fix this is to power the unit off and restart it this of course wouldn t be so bad if it just had the resume feature 
chintzy design very misleading pictures based on the pictures shown on amazon as well as logitech s web site one would believe the dropping your ipod into the dock charges and provides the audio connection to the speakeres you d be incorrect on both counts you still have to plug into the computer to charge this thing and there s a cable not shown in any of the pictures that you have to plug into the top of your ipod to make the audio connection we returned this item and went with something by altec lansing in the same price range instead were much happier with it 
save your money i loved my previous microsoft keyboard this one doesn t work i ve spent more than hours on the phone not including waiting time with microsoft tech reps somewhere in india finally i was told if i was not satisfied i should return the keyboard they d run out of ideas i m running a dual core processor dell computer with windows vista ultimate i m still finding it hard to believe that microsoft s own hardware designed for vista cannot be made to work i suggest logitech 
does not work with large sd cards buyer beware this reader does not work with large sd cards i could not get it to work with a new gb sd card my gb cards work fine but anything over that will probably not work i confirmed with with lexar technical support as they have not tested this yet 
just a comment about the different circuits this is not technically a review although based on what i ve read i do plan on buying one of these however i found something on smarthome com which will inter connect the two main circuits that most houses have thus allowing devices like this and x work from any outlet to any other this is not yet tested by me but is at least promising device is here httpwwwsmarthomecombhtmlexplanation is here httpwwwsmarthomecomimagesdgmbigjp 
not suitable for heavy books this bookstand despite the description is not suitable for heavy books if you put heavy books on this the stand that props up the whole unit is likely to snap off 
save up you can do much better the previous comments about these headphones being distancesounding are right on the mark they have very little soundstage and the mid range sounded muddy to me bass is decent and they have treble but do yourself a big favor save up some more money and go for the sennheiser hd s for about you ll be getting a killer set of cans with great soundstage if you get a chance to a b the difference between the hd s and hd s you will not be able to buy the s the hd are very close in sound to sennheiser s primo hd s but cost less than the s go for the real value of the hd s if your really in a pinch for cans i think the open ear koss ktx titanium phones for about bucks make a much nicer sound than the hd s comfort of the hd s is also a big issue they aren t nearly as comfortable for long wearing sessions as the sennheiser series headphones or the koss in summary the hd is a mediocre headphone even at this price range 
not so pleased with the cobra road trip hand held cb radio i tested the cobra hand held cb on california rt today not so good tuned into truckers channel for north south traffic and heard mostly noise there was very little discernible language so i squelched out the noise and waited and waited i called out for a radio check and got a comeback loud but not clear the speaker in that hand held cb is awful it s abrasive to listen to it is my opinion that the short inch magnetic roof antenna is ineffective in receiving clear signals and if you do get a clear nearby signal it is unlistenable because of the poor quality of the speaker this cb radio needs some work to make it worth using on the road perhaps a longer whip antenna in the roof mount along with a better quality extension speaker will make the system less annoying i was looking for a portable system for temporary use but the cobra hh road trip cb is pretty poor personally i wouldn t buy it again 
great printer but unreliable i bought this printer after my hp tn started needing us to press the button on the printer every time we queued a print job at first the seemed the answer to our needs it was very easy to set up for our home office and kids machines it printed and copied fast and sharp that lasted for about pages and then it started producing a huge white area down the middle of the page removing and shaking the cartridge would fix this for a a few pages and then that stopped working faced with a long and frustrating time on the phone with support i decided to just get a new cartridge this did the trick for about pages and then it started missing the whole center section of the page again shaking the cartridge fixes it temporarily of course it always does it when we are in a panic with a customer proposal or homework due that day i am using genuine hp cartridges which are each my advice is to look at the competition great idea but it doesn t print ! 
design defect makes unusable i knew this cable was on the economy end of monster s product line but i expected it to nevertheless be a quality product due to the monster name the cable simply doesn t work because the terminals are not split they do not hold tight on the connections on the video component you put them on and they just slide off this was the case on both a new dvd player and a cable box so it wasn t a question of the video component being out of spec monster should pull this off the market and fix the design defect 
power adapter good thing i read reviews prior to purchasing power adapter thanks to of reviews i found that the adapter recommended on this website for the model i own is in fact the wrong one why hasn t this issue been resolved the reviews are dated from dec to july ! 
doesn t work i got this and installed it it can t read cds or dvds it can t write cds it can only write dvds 
still getting telemarketer calls the telezapper has been a very poor substitute for ameritech s privacy manager which worked of the time the telezapper may have reduced some of the telemarketing calls but it has definitely not eliminated them and we ve had it for months i d recommend looking into alternatives before buying a telezapper 
not worth it just got this item recently to split my vga output on my comp this particular item is not worth the price the cables are not shielded and you will get ghosting even tried buying some ferrite cores to no effect do youself a favor and don t be cheap for a couple extra dollars you can get a splitter that s shielded 
poor kept dropping cell calls i returned the entire motorola c system it kept droppong cell phone calls i then purchased the panasonic kx th and it works great 
cheap cordless solution mediocre voice volume terrible with voip ie vonage i bought this phone to replace an older vtech phone which incidentally is a far superior model i saw that the is ghz and on the merits of not interfering with the wireless network traffic buzzing around my house i bought it this proved to be a terrible mistake caller id functionality for vonage mysteriously stopped working even though this phone s ren is rated at b i spent weeks on the phone with tech support additionallythe voice quality is terrible any time we make long distance calls we are constantly told that it sounds like we are conversing into the handset from across the room we have to yell to make ourselves barely heard out of desperation i used my rudimentary electronics skills to put my old ghz vtech back together i cleaned it up dusted it out charged it and guess what voice quality is back caller id is functioning once again as well regardless of whether you have vonage i would avoid the phone altogether for vonage users however it is an absolute no no save yourself months of misery and frustration 
usually like panasonic but not this one bought this phone a few months ago to replace old cordless panasonic ghz that died this is probably the worst phone i ve ever owned several reasons the range is worse than the ghz i had ! i used to be able to get great reception in every room of my large one level home and in my big yard now i can only venture about of the distance i could before and then the connection starts to break up and i ve given up taking it outside the voice enhancer is useless it doesn t work the sound is worse than just leaving it in normal mode love the speaker phone feature in the handset but it doesn t work when you have it sitting in the recharger base dumb it d be nice when the battery gets really low to be able to use the speaker phone while it charges but nope if you run out of charge the phone is useless until it recharges again i still can t figure out the phone s weird caller id inconsistency sometimes it doesn t register incoming calls at all and worse it doesn t register all missed calls so i can contact people who may not have left a message and instead of listing each id in the order it came in especially duplicate callers it ll just put a check mark by a recently called entry so you know that person called more than once but you don t know when yeah if people leave messages every time they call this wouldn t be a problem but you know they don tim usually not hard to please but i m looking now to replace this phone that is fairly new 
worked ok for about days then stopped the drive arrived at the end of december was quick to get up and running and worked fine until yesterday then it got the machine equivalent of lockjaw and i ve been unable to get the tray to release so it s a good drive while it operates but i ll probably make sure i pay for at least a year warranty on my next purchase as far as my recommendation goes it depends very much on how inconvenient it is when one s drive fails yesterday i just went to a backup burner and kept working if i had needed to get the job done and i had not previously developed a strategy of always keeping a backup device handy i d have been in a seething hair pulling rage computer hardware is never reliable but is it worth the risk to purchase a device that is known to fail in less than a year 
your mileage may vary i bought this tv base on its positive reviews and i was pretty satisfy with its performance both picture quality and viewing angle are comparable to much higher price units unfortunately my tv died within two months the unit won t power on and i m force to deal with olevia support olevia say they will ship out a power unit to me and then i have to call back to schedule a tech to install it it s been weeks and i still don t have the part and get this i live within miles of olevia s warehouse ! olevia support s hold time is at least minuts each time you call i say buying a olevia is more of a roll of the dice if you get a working one then you re fine however if anything goes wrong with it then be prepare to be without your tv for a long time 
a fair shake i ve owned two pairs of these for over years and used them in different environments multifloor house single floor apartment and have to concur with others that it is nearly impossible to get a clean signal static popping cordless phone conversations from other houses apartments etc is the norm i ve also tried tuning across the variable spectrum with the same failed results they work for my purposes but i can t honestly recommend these to anyone 
short life i bought this thing because i lost a memory mod to a power surge it worked fine at first but now it has no battery life recently the power went out and my computer shut off immediately like it was not on a backup at all of course the alarm was still screaming but so what my computer was already shut off without any warning i had this thing for two years but i will be going with a different brand next time 
don t buy this junk i bought this and within ten minutes it failed i was completely dissappointed with this purchase i loved the concept but the product is cheap and will not hold up to normal use lesson learned 
big problem anamorphic picture i bought this product it was excellent before i found the picture is anamorphicif we see anamorphic wide screen movie at a screen the shape is perfectly anamorphic if you don t select letterbox but even in the wide mode at it still little too much anamorphic if you watch carefully the screen human face looks longer than the standard and circle looks ellipseafter i saw this it border me i could not watch the movie i tried several different movies but same result i went to best buy circuit city and comp usa and tried all portable dvd players maybe you don t believe it all screen dvd players had same anamorphic problems philips polaroid initial insignia etc i think all companys are from same lcd panel company i have returned players polaroid low contrast panasonic do not have av input insignia anamorphic problem toshiba not clear dark picture and av input image is terrible and philips anamorphic problems finally i bought a durrabrand player at wall mart picture is not progressive but very high contrast and very clear and realistic and not anamorphic and av input image is also good it is just like panasonic quality av input even little samller screen the but now i am very satisfied of the product i am also disappointed of the famous brand panasonic specially toshiba and company of inch if you don t mind the anamorphic you can buy philips or any chipper but i don t recommend itif you don t mind av input buy panasonic 
faulty wiring i detest this printer i ve bought quite a few printers in my day lexmark canon and have been quite happy with most hp s but this was the pits the first one i brought home worked fine the first time but when i tried to turn it on the next day it wouldn t cut on it just died on me i unplugged it plugged it back it then it worked for a little while before dying again this time for good i returned it got another one same problem except this time it keeps going all i have to do is unplug it before each and every time i turn it on nice huh now i m browsing online again and i ve learned my lesson for sure no more el cheapo models i m at least going to shell out for a midline price with some heft to it that will last me a year or two 
caution the drive is speedy no doubt about it it had good features such as ability to create a secure and unsecure partition but all its features are useless when the design of the product is flawed as noted by others the metal casing connects to a plastic right around the usb connection that can break no matter how careful you are when you pull the drive out of a usb port you are applying pressure to this plastic part and it s guaranteed to break at some point unless you re careful all the time it s extremely fragile having said that i would not buy this drive if i had known this before 
waste of money the range on this product is no where near what was advertised i purchased units and neither will work consistently beyond feet from mac attempted to improve operation by relocating mac using usb extension cable and changing id on transmitter with no improvement extremely disappointed 
regrettable purchase from all outer appearances this item looked like it would function well in my office the day i received it i eagerly placed paper in it only to question if i was using it correctly i discovered that this item requires an hour or so to warm up before it will shred anything as fed but here are some suggested ways to work around it first you can leave paper in the mouth and it will sit inactively for minutes before it arbitrarily shreds the noise level is comparable to a sink disposal a second alternative is to feed the paper from bottom up and hit reverse because that is the only working function available from the get go 
junk don t buy fell apart within about weeks of mild use when tuning veneer cover pulled apart and splintered not worth 
great idea but lacks follow through the gps works great ! having said that i m disappointed with the overall i could not get the free map updates from tomtom because hp does not include the navigator product code with the hp s support promised they d get the maps and post them for users but that hasn t happened after several months of promises the wireless worked only with non encrypted networks and even then only for day i have to perform a soft reset at least three times a day because the system hangs mps play fine it will play video albeit they are very choppy usb connections to the computer seem to work only after loading the very latest ms activesync and only after a soft reset even then having the computer recognize the device is very iffythe unit is a great idea if you travel maps email internet music contacts appointments etc but if it doesn t work it becomes a paperweight i ve read dozens of forums with others complaining of the same issues hp support so far has been nothing but lip service my recommendation dont fall for the marketing hype this unit still has to have a lot of bugs worked out 
ati radeon mb agp x i bought one of these cards at christmas and my wife bought the xl they look just alike and both are a terrible card for the money we paid she paid at newegg and i bought mine at zipzzoomfly for we both paid to much for these cards i just upgraded last month to a new nvidia a i paid less for the card and it outperforms it in everyway i would never buy another of these even if all i did was surf the web they run hot a cause lockups and ati when i talked with them said they were aware of the problem and recommended a fan why did nt they put one on i asked and they said it was due to cost there technical support is the worst i have ever seen as for gaming my daughter runs a mb x sis made by elite group and it smokes this card i know this because i used aquamark to bench test it pay less and buy a nvidia card with a factory fan and be happy i am ordering another one of the nvidia a s for my wife 
scratched my macbook as long as its on it will prevent scratches but its tough to get off and that act can scratch your laptop it scratched my macbook when i pried it off the guy at the apple store who snapped it on a macbook beause i requested a demo couldn t pry it off and after embarassing minutes he called a colleague over and they pried it off together and to be honest this makes the mb look ugly kinda like putting a veil on a supermodel 
not for running i wore these yesterday for the first and last time i bought these headphones in hopes that they would stay in or at least near my ears when running they didn t last one minute they are very light but at the same time very flimsy the over ear design does nothing in the way of supporting the buds in you ears like i had hoped the buds are set at an awkward angle and found myself having a hard time even when stationary keeping them in or on my ears as far as sound holding them on my ears they sounded terrific albeit very uncomfortable holding them in place also pretty much defeats the purpose of having headphones another thing to be noted the volume control on the cord is a terrible idea the volume pod itself probably weighs as much as the headphones unless the volume control is secured somehow it is very problematic doing any sort of activity these are probably what to expect out of a set of headphones comfort sound design costbenefit 
poor quality it didn t work when i try to transfer video from my camcorder to my laptop there is no image neither sound in my lap according to the manufacturer s laptop technical support staff the problem is with the cheapest cards i stongly recommend to buy a well known brand name card 
worked great at first till it only started taking left turns i was impressed with this controller at first and found it to feel comfortable and work well it was played with once and a while for about a month total hours max some time after that the next time i went to use it it would only go left in a game that used the left joystick i could not get it to center or even stay still it would just keep either steering the car like burnout or whatever the left joystick would do for the game no matter what i tried it several times and it has never worked since i fire it up once and a while to see if it s still doing it and it does i am very dissapointed in this and i was pretty careful about getting this newer version of the logitech controller i think i paid about locally for it and i just bought a pelican extreme edge from radio shack on clearance for that works and feels as good but is less than half the cost i don t really feel like going thru a warranty claim if it s even covered but it still annoys me every time i look at it in my xbox drawer of extra stuff i was going to go totally wireless units and luckily didn t run out and buy more of these logitech controllers i instead bought some extra microsoft s controllers as they are still one of the best feeling controllers out there if the pelican holds up model pl version i might go get some more if i can find them locally 
that s why i hate apple never seen a worse less intuitive inconvenient to use and worsely documented software that itunes apples is up to it s usual standard that s precisely why i prefer not to mess with it 
palm fan says awful for some time i ve been buying a new palm every couple of years this is first time i ve really regretted my purchase im now on my third tungsten t having sent one then another in for warranty repair really they just replaced it the second one froze up and died after only one month at least the first one had lasted a few months before it died even the replacement i just got crashes with regularity i haven t even installed any third party software on it yet the touch screen goes completely out of alignment every few hours sometimes so badly i can hardly get into settings to fix it the sd card reader is also not working i probably won t send it back over that though because i m sick of paying to send it in for repairs when it s working properly i generally like it i m annoyed that it has no vibrate function though i don t know why they eliminated it and i wish it had wifi capability instead of just bluetooth at this point i d really just like to get my money back but it s too late 
functional but disappointing i purchased this clock as a replacement for an older timex travel alarm clock that i lost while this model functions on a basic level it is disappointing overall as another reviewer mentioned this clock gains time quickly after just a couple of days it will be minutes ahead of the actual time if you only use the clock for weekend trips this probably won t be much of an inconvenience but for longer trips or regular use at home this is a bit of a nuisance i can honestly say that in my entire life i have never had any clock watch or other appliance so poor at keeping the correct time i have also been disappointed with the quality of the indiglo backlight on this clock on my last travel alarm as well as my indiglo watch the indiglo backlight is bright and makes the characters easy to read in the dark however on this clock the indiglo backlight is feeble by comparison it s just bright enough to qualify as usable but if your eyesight isn t great the combination of the weak backlight and the fact that you probably aren t wearing contacts or glasses in the middle of the night may make this clock difficult for you to read as far as the user interface is concerned the time display is very large but other on screen items such as the alarm on indicator are not necessarily obvious by a quick glance at the display the indiglo button as you can see in the picture is in the middle of the face of the unit my last travel alarm placed this button on the top of the unit if you can imagine trying to illuminate your clock in a pitch dark room you can probably guess which location is more convenient fortunately all the buttons you need to set the clock are easily located on the lower half of the face of the unit for setting the time alarm the clock has a pair of up down buttons that move the time in one if you press and release or if you hold minute increments this is particularly useful for making small time adjustments backwards overall i have been very disappointed with this clock it lacks some of the ease ofuse features i m used to and it suffers from poor craftsmanship it was relatively inexpensive and it hasn t technically broken but if i could go back in time i would most certainly purchase a different travel alarm 
destroyed my cd i wanna give this product minus stars before the repair process there was one bad track on my cd after the repair process the entire disk was unplayable took it back for a refund with billions of cds in the world is this the best that the st century has to offer

fatally flawed problem with controller causes lockups an excellent idea with a fatally flawed implementation it appears to be a limitation of the midi controller drums will fail to sound intermittantly br br an except from my so far unanswered request for support from ion audiocombr br i have found a problem with my new ion ied electronic drum set the drums appear to conflict perhaps in the midi interface perhaps within the alesis controller br br when playing the drums a pad will fail to sound intermittantly and occasionally the whole system will mute momentarily br br i hope this isn t the first you ve heard of this issue and that a fix is available br br of course i ve checked the connections checked to be sure i m hitting the pads squarely and in the center tried swapping pads though the issue affects all of them not just the snare etc br br if fact i can often reproduce the problem by simply repeatedly striking any two pads together one a split second after the other when it happens the second appears to mute the first before the first fully produces a tone br br br untilunless this issue s resolved you ll find the set a cause of repeated frustration whether for learning practice or performance 
canon paper on the package it says x postcard size paper we thought it was describing the size of the paper which we wanted for prints however it was x postcard stock which was a little deceiving we will use it but it is not what we wanted 
surprisingly thin tinny sound first a little about myself as a listener i m no audiophile so i don t put any stock in the reviews from bose bashers or the claimed audiophiles i know what i like when i hear it i have the acoustimass system attached to my home theater and i love it the size makes it unobtrusive when the object is to watch a movie and the sound is really great for my den i have the polk lsi speakers attached to some high dollar gear and the sound is awesome i ve skimped on my computer speakers because i didn t see a use for high quality sound coming from the noisy box under my desk but i d hoped to change that with a nice set of bose speakers that were unobtrusive like my home theater i have a logitech thx system that sounded decent and it sounded better than these speakers at one third of the price since i moved my computer room to the attic i can no longer mount the logitech speakers due to the size setup of this room so i needed a system as for the companion system the quality of the components is very good i like the control pod and the setup was fast and easy however immediately apparent with the companion speakers is the thin tinny sound coming from the satellites it sounded like i was listening to my computer through a phone line unlike the acoutimass system i was very aware of the fact that all of the base was coming from the subwoofer and i was equally aware of the location of the base module i checked the documentation for correct placement and was discouraged to find out that i had indeed placed the speakers correctly still i moved things around and around and fiddled with the settings and moved things around until i found a placement that delivered acceptable though not really good sound quality i had to place the subwoofer directly behind my monitor with the satellites right next to the monitor to get a sound that would keep me from returning the system im not thrilled with the bose speakers and i ll go back to my logitech system if i relocate my desk again i wish i had a recommendation for a nice system but i wouldn t recommend the companion system to anyone looking for a good sound from a set of computer speakers 
product controls the throttle control is to small and not in a good location on the joystick the different buttons are ok but for use in flight simulator they are not in a good location overall performance is ok but not exceptional i feel that the price is not consistant with the expectations of the joystick i expected more

service after purchase they want the buyer to call for the service agreement of course you want a hard copy that is why you bought it just do it 
flimsy avoid avoid avoid star i wrote an initial review that praised these headpohones but after a recent breakdown i had to readjust my rating from to star below is my initial review followed by the update i can t really say whether these reviews are accurate or not because i ve only had my pair for days they were a valentine s day gift i can say this much so far so good the cons like others have stated already the sound is good but not great and they don t get very loud the bass is virtually nonexistant too the coord is long but it s also incredibly flimsy for a set that s supposed to be high quality the pros i gave these a star rating simply because so far they re durable they re affordable and despite what i ve read quite comfortable in my opinion i ve spent hours and hours spinning records with these on and i haven t had any discomfort i should mention that i have small ears despite the heavy mileage i ve already put on them again i may not be the best judge because i ve only had them for days the package also contains a few cool skullcandy stickers an adapter for stereos mixers and the like a nice looking travel bag that has room for more than just the headphones and a pair of black ear cushions if you don t like the camo my personal opinion as a dj while these aren t the worst headphones out there you should probably go for something better if you have the cash i swear by the senheisser brand but those and other high end brands can get a little expensive depending on the quality level you want i think skullcandy spent more time on the cosmetic aspect instead of focusing on performance but i d easily recommend these to beginners or those that want a more affordable above average set of headphones well see if i can say that they re durable months from now though i ll update this review if they turn out to be crappy but so far they aren tupdate march like most of these reviews have stated these things don t last i went to turn my set on and they just gave out on me i haven t had them for more than a month itll be a month on the th i haven t dropped them or yanked the cord or anything of that nature yet my headphones have failed on me for that very reason i reduce my rating from to star these things are terrible 
ok if you don t need it more then feet from base after the last panasonic line debacle key failes in months on all handsets yikes ! and with not having a lot of other choices on the market we were forced to buy the new edition of the panasonic phone how bad could it be we figured they have to have figured out how to build a decent handset buy now well the handset is probably ok but when we took it feet from the base we lost signa what called panasonic and of course customer service probably had never seen the phone suggested to unplug the battery for heaven s sake hang up call back next person educates me that ghz just means clearer signal but range is shorter wtf we immediately boxed this piece of junk up and sent it back do yourself a favor buy from a different manufacturer 
don t buy these if you are a runner these are a huge waste of money don t buy them ! i used them on one three mile run and they must have fallen out of my ears times i came home and tossed them in the trash save your 
fooled again once again i m amazed at how the reviews were so highly in favor of this product these are terribly uncomfortable for my ears and don t really provide that great of listening experience the frequency response seems muted until you use the largest possible surrounds and then they become distractingly uncomfortable but of course this is just my experience your mileage may vary as they say personally i found my apple ipod phones to be better 
never buying an hp printer again i ve tried to install this printer on several machines running windows xp via ethernet and every time on each machine there has been a problem with the installation which btw takes about minutes to complete this scanner s twain driver does not work well at all with any version of adobe acrobat writer ive tried versions and one cannot scan documents directly from adobe acrobat to create a file hp support does not recognize this as their issue as i am someone who relies heavily on acrobat writer which costs twice as much as this printer i cannot tolerate this incompatibility i am sending this printer back and going with my father inlaws advice hp is no longer a quality product but another brand like brother overall i am very disappointed in this product it is sad to see that my old hp bubble jet printer which is years old and still working fine is built with a much higher standard of quality than this current 
poor reception and constant static this phone has constant static and very poor reception it constantly makes a clicking soun 
not good very clear image ! probably the best that i saw on this kind devices ! no software availble device is useless if you do not have windows media os absolutely no linux support good hardware but useless you have to buy software for to be able use it 
good for about cards so after scanning my first batch of cards which it worked great for the scanner simply stopped working correctly it couldn t be recalibrated and won t read any more cards i called tech support only to learn that this is a known problem there is no fix available and that it s likely due to their outsourcing of the manufacturing of this product i m returning the one i got and i d strongly recommend against getting one until the quality issues are resolved 
defect cf card i purchased how can i get replacement i have had a canon g since i used to use viking mb cf cards and had no problem in october i bought one viking cfm mb cf card from amazon i did not use it until this summer after i had taken more photos and reviewed i immediately found a few images corrupted no matter how i tried e g format the cf before use there were alway corrupted images i wonder if i can return the defect cf card and get a replacement from amazon or from manufacturer sherwoodla count 
far too overpriced for this length you shouldn t spend more than much like the previous reviewer i urge you not to spend lots of money on hdmi cables hdmi specs state that only one pixel out of every billion can be lost therefore there is no reason no matter what the cable is made of to spend money on hdmi cables search the internet you can find plenty of good ft hdmi cables for or less digital is zeroes and ones in hdmi s case either the cable is connected or it isn t 
no noise cancelling effect these headphones have a dececent sound but genuinely no noice cancelling effect the battery powers the speakers a bit which does make them a littel louder but nothing special as you see the price is down to which is probably a good price for these unfortunatly i bought them at and had to return them 
not worth it as the title it not worth the money at all even at such a low price the picture quality is bad very bad i d rather spend this money for other web cam 
sucks bought new around cd player and lcd clock stopped working within months now nap function and radio are all that works if only i could find the damn receipt 
update password can t be registered read my initial review below which was on july on august kensington told me that they do not know when the password registration process will be working and they strongly urged me to send the product back for a refund on july i wrote this should be a great item at a great price and as far as i can tell it works fine kensington has some serious technical problems however the encryption installs and becomes fully functional before you can register your usb key and password registration is essential in case you lose the key or forget your password this is a big problem because as of july kensington s registration utility was down and not expected to be working until days current estimate worse the message i got when attempting to register my key the first two days was authentication failed which told me nothing even worse their overseas technical support person did not know about the problem so he also thought i had a defective key and we wasted a lot of time discussing replacement and timing im about to leave on a trip and really wanted this protection for the trip when i finally realized that i would not receive a new key before i left i asked whether i should uninstall the product or whether i could register the key verbally in case the key was lost on the trip i figured the answer was no but i was getting desperate he went away for a long time then he reported that he would have to call me back that took minutes and finally he reported that probably my key was fine it s the registration that was offline and no there is no other way to register that s part of the security so the encryption is in place the laptop boots and runs fine but i have two days to decide whether to risk taking my laptop and losing the physical key which means i would have to wipe my hard drive or risk uninstalling the encryption and having the laptop stolen in which case i still lose all my data and sensitive data is exposed the laptop will be at risk in hotel rooms and the key will be at risk on my person as i will be swimming and snorkeling kensington claims the thing is waterproof maybe i ll just buy one of those little waterproof capsules and keep it around my neck 
slow slow and slow do not buy this product it is incredibly slow by far the slowest usb drive out of the dozen or so that i ve used it handles small numbers of large files rather well but it immediately chokes whenever faced with a large quantity of small files i attempted to copy mb files directories to the disk and it took almost minutes to complete the copy ! that s roughly k second deleting the files was painful as well taking at least minutes to delete everything for kicks i popped in an old mb kingston drive and was able to copy the same set of files to it in under seconds and the delete took under seconds bottom line is don t be fooled by the drive s small physical size large capacity and price point it simply doesn t perform 
don t waste your money i had pair that lasted about weeks they did exchange them for me from the original seller the next pair made it month the company won t even answer me i am still trying to reach ho but i don t seem to believe they will be answering me either these are a waste of money the sound comes and goes at first now they are not working at all very very disappointed

poor sound quality i recently bought this radio primarily for my car but also got the home dock it was easy to set up and install both types of kit unfortunately the sound quality was very poor in both configurations the fm modulator for the car was pretty close to hopeless it only has maybe channels i found one that was free luckily but even with a clear channel the sound had a terrible hiss that went up and down in volume at apparent random even when everything was stationary the occupied channels actually worked about as well still lots of hiss except when the underlying channel broke through even disregarding the hiss the sound quality on the music was not very good i thought the problem was probably with the fm modulator so i tried it in the home dock connected to a very good home hi fi system the hiss was gone but the sound quality was completely unacceptable for whatever reason this particular receiver doesn t like the compression artifacts very much satellite radio quality is at best about like an average mp with highly compressed signals some channels better than others this receiver seemed to exacerbate the effect and it sounded a lot like a tin can and string telephone most of the time it was vert irritating very quickly the form factor about the size of a modern walkie talkie was fine and pretty easy to fit in the car it also seemed to be pretty solidly built but all of that is completely moot if it doesn t work properly i returned the receiver and both kits the next day 
not to be used with ipaq this keyboard folds out well and i liked the feel of the keys however the ir connector needs to be in direct connection with the ir port in the pda for the ipaq this port is at the bottom of the handheld the degree arm does not rotate to this area in order to have the proper connectivity you have to turn the handheld on its side this then requires another software program download not freeware that i can find to rotate your screen to the landscape view unless you can read sideways without getting a headache before buying this product check your handheld to see if your ir port is between o clock if so this may be a difficult keyboard to use 
scratched my macbook as long as its on it will prevent scratches but its tough to get off and that act can scratch your laptop it scratched my macbook when i pried it off the guy at the apple store who snapped it on a macbook beause i requested a demo couldn t pry it off and after embarassing minutes he called a colleague over and they pried it off together and to be honest this makes the mb look ugly kinda like putting a veil on a supermodel 
this phone has no battery life even with a brand new set of batteries this handset still fully discharges in a few hours even when no calls are made i have the older motorola md and it has usually a day life even when making several calls a day don t buy the 
hello can i hear you i bought these because i just could not stand the headphones that came with my cd player slsv they were extremly uncomfortable so i went ahead and bought them i pluged in the headphone and i couldn t hear anything the volume was around the area and the player only goes to i could hear music on but it was still too quiet i put it on the highest volume and automatically i heard distortation i was very unhappy with these headphones they are just so quiet just save yourself the money and don t buy these headphones 
don t waste your money i bought this at a department store and that should have been my first clue that it would not be the greatest in quality i should have just gone to a store that only sells electronics but now i am stuck with this piece of junk don t do what i did the radio never picks up any of the stations i used to get on my other radio which i am now having to use again my cds constantly skipped and forget about playing a burned cd that will never happen it s just junk that s all don t waste your time or energy 
disappointed am is now making a clicking sound very weak looks great but not as strong as i had thought in terms of sensistivity i love poratable am fm radios 
worthless sony premium grade t vhs tapes used to be pretty darn good these days that is not the case the past few times that i have bought these tapes to record movies from the satellite dish there have been to many flaws with the tape one problem has been a line through the middle of the picture like you sometimes have when you rent a movie thats about years old and also there have been jumping pictures and small audio flaws as well i use various brands of videotape so i know that the problem lies here with the sony videotape basically the record about as well as a tape you have recorded on over and over and over they show too much wear way too soon get maxell tapes instead 
awful do not buy this may be the worst product i ve ever bought it has never worked properly i ve kept fresh batteries in it but it s still no good within feet of the laptop i ll click three or four times and nothing happens then i ll click and the slides go in fast forward until the end it s quite embarrassing to be giving a professional presentation and have this happen awful product believe the bad reviews it s worse than they describe the only positive thing i can say about the product is that it doubles nicely as a cat toy my cat loves the laser pointer 
did not work i plugged this cable into my tv and the tv did not recognize the source i m not sure it the tv needs to be digital 
avoid at all costs do not by this product it has several issues go to the forums on the linksys website and see for yourself most people myself included have problems with the cable modem crashing and requiring a reset on a regular basis this device also has firewall issues that cause problems with the wii and xbox it s spi firewall component is at fault and can not be disabled without turning off the entire firewall even in the face of the number of users having problems linksys has never released a firmware update and it doesn t appear that they will 
features don t work and panasonic is aware i have the ghz version and i love it but it does buzz sometimes because of my home wireless network so i thought i d try the ghz what a surprise to find it isn t as good yes it has some nice features that do work but over all it way over priced and flawed it s really hard to get a call off hold once you place them on hold i never did figure out how to do that it s really difficult to call in to get your messages knowing what to push waiting to be told and you better have a lot of patience if you push a wrong button it s supposed to page you when a caller leaves a message my pages me with the caller id of the person who left the messages from the main unit the hand sets page me with the number of the handset so i know which one the message is on the new pages you with a blank page you don t even have a way of knowing for sure that it was your phone system that did page you it dials your pager then nothing so i get paged with a blank page as if someone called my pager and didn t leave a message or my cell phone with number held the pause key doesn t work in the paging portion of the phone so you can enter a number and a pause to wait before continuing to enter numbers the worst part of the phone system is panasonic i m sorry to say i buy a lot of panasonic products but i won t be so much in a hurry to buy this name brand they do not answer emails i spent hours on the phone only to have the techs read to me from the manual that i have they don t know the phone no one bothers to ask or look into anything and after they read to you from the manual they hang up on you so you have to start over i took it back and i went back to using my which is many years old or when i finally did get responses from panasonic via email i was told that that feature doesn t work that feature doesn t work that feature doesn t work and if that feature doesn t work return for replacement i had to go back to my email to see the order in which the questions were being answered very impersonal 
save your money let me come straight to the point this stuff is garbage please save your hard earned cash and purchase something different this does nothing to remove or repair scratches if you want to waste dollars you can rip up a dollar bill and flush it down the toilet if i could rate this item as zero stars then i would 
no charging units i bought these way radios thinking they came with charging units not amazon should send everyone who bought these radios under false pretense rechargeable batteries 
familiarity breeds contempt i wanted to give this calculator higher marks on paper it appears to have alot going for it o two line displayo editable equation historyo persistent function memories o functionso bitwise logical operators and five number baseso neat cheat sheeto equation solverhowever the more i got to know this calculator the more i disliked it the large glass panel covering the display and the top rd of the unit is highly reflective and makes the display hard to read under flourescents the two line display is a source of continued frustration the top line which at first appears to be the input area shares this function with the bottom line function key presses register immediately on the top line the bottom line is for numeric input which only registers on the top line when a function key is pressed yuk ! i often find myself having to delete redundant digits due to this input area confusion not so with the casio fx ms the algb function suffers from s poor functional separation of input output prompting for variable input is severely restricted only the numeric input line is available thus no expressions only simple numeric literals to populate the variables with expression results you must first evaluate and store these before executing the algb operation the equation solver is also lame no underlying algebraic rewrite rules are in effect as with the casio fx ms and hp s so if you want to perform a time value money series you will have to rewrite the equation yourself for each variable of interest periodic payment period interest rate number of periods principal future balance with its beaucoup functions i m sure this calculator has alot to offer engineers however the function memory and equation history persistence don t quite compensate for its disturbing lack of elegance 
confusing basically the o comes with very few instructions and you have to go on the internet to find any manuals and so on even with the online help it is very confusing and i have not been able to get it to work at all the instructions you do get assume that you have used other midi devices in the past and so that just getting a hint written in computer jargon is enough 
junk horrible support i got the coz it was an ati card and i have built my last systems with ati cards this card is not ready for prime time i could not get this pos to work with my sapphiretech x pro hdmi card i did a clean install of mce downloaded all the latest drivers and even bought the required amplified antenna hdtv signal through mce showed bars yet tv signal could not be found error message tried with catalyst mc and got nothing but macroblocking ati s support suggested that i had overscan issue bios issues and finally suggested that i try a rd party software vendor well i ll try a rd party hardware vendor until ati figures out their issues i build pcs as a hobby and have never had such headaches as i did with the ati pulled these cards for a reason and re released them with the requirement of an amplified antenna look to spend an extra support slow and inept look elsewhere unless you feel like spending the extra money for an amplified antenna and paying for someone to come out and sort through atis driver issues 
it was a nice set until they service the warranty over a week ago i noticed my month old olevia lthvs locking up and shutting off by itself i callled syntax brillian corporation to take advantage of the warranty they said they would ship the parts out right away and then send a technicain over to install them i checked back with them days later and they said they would ship the parts out tommorrow the customer service is abominable this is my second olevia set such a shame because when the olevias work its a great product at a very competetive price i will tell you this based on my experience with the warranty in the first year i would not by an extended warraty from sytax i am shopping for a third party one that can give me quicker service i will edit this when my set is restored 
if i could find a better pouch i would i would not buy this again the edge of the pouch impinges on the earphones connection and already wore out i set of earphones the attachment to a belt is tricky to use cant be done one handed and frequently unlatches when i am moving around i am in the market for a better one 
faulty product unresponsive customer service this is the only card that has ever failed to work on my palm tungsten c so i know it s not a hardware problem with my pda the handheld device recognizes the card and filez shows that the programs and databases are present and available but the program doesn t run the only response i get is loading from card please wait but nothing happens my repeated queries to tech support via its web site have gone unanswered don t count on any help from the company if you also get a lemon 
great for women but what about men prior to my zen v plus i had a creative muvo tx fm which came with an armband and belt clip in the box it was a very comfortable and easy to use until it was stolen as a replacement i thought i would upgrade to the zen unfortunately the armband for the zen v plus had to be purchased separately i chose to go with the creative branded band based on my previous experience to my surprise the creative armband is too small for me now i m but i m not much of a weight lifter so my biceps are only however the available strap length is less than that so i cannot get a comfortable fit it fits too tightly and tends to pops open as i try to secure it due to lack of slack i looked online and found that the average male bicep is in circumference about the same as the armband s strap as previous reviewers have stated the included silicon skin is nice but it seems that this unit was designed for women children and smaller than average men so guys unless you have a bicep or smaller i would look elsewhere for an armband to use while you work out 
poor execution of good ideas this phone has many features that i really wanted ability to add addition hands sets shared phonebook speakerphone on each handset ghz dss i didn t find any other phone w these features even though to me they seem like minimal features in a modern phone anyway i am really disappointed each feature is poorly executed such that it is really a pretty lousy phone the shared phonebook is a nice idea but so hard to access and find the number that its really quicker to dial the number yourself the voicequality of the handsets is inferior to every other phone i ve used the only sorta exception is that the handset speakerphone voicequality is even worse dss is nice but the range is short doesnt reach out to my driveway even though my baby monitor works fine in that location i recommend that you not buy this phone wait till another company implements this feature set in a better phone 
it crushed so often on vista the drivers can t be installed very unstable on vista 
stay away you may be tempted to buy these because of the sony name but be warned do not buy sony cd rs off of amazon i bought this same pack and had to throw half yes half as in of the discs out because they had read errors and god knows what else i find this strange though because i ve bought and still do these same sony cd rs from best buy and at target and at staples and they ve always worked fine i thought i would give it a go buying the online and i m sorry i did if you want the sony cd s just go to your local target and pick em up there at least i can tell based off my experience they ll work can t say the same for the ones coming from amazon 
bad news i have a lexus gs and this item failed miserably the skip function did not work and the unit randomly changed the tracks on the ipod without any user intervention and the mechanism itself made so much noise that when the music was set at a lower volume you could hear the cassette mechanism turning over the music top that off the sound quality provided by the unit was fair at best disaster 
don t buy it really just don t do it i have used it for months and it s been tearing apart since the first one besides that it is cumbersome to fit it correctly with one hand the way i use it i run a lot the ipod end up soaked in sweat at the end of the wourkout lately i ve been having problems with my sensor receiver i don t know if that s due to be so wet so often but the armband won t prevent it a bit you can get use to control the music and volume with it but if you wanna see how fast or how long you ve been running you have to wait until you finish your workout that s an obvious flaw screen covered but the bad craftmanship and how difficult is to fit it worth mention it 
not recommended the holes giving access to the thumb stick volume buton and zoom button are horrible the case shifts a little and pushes a button or most commonly presses the thumb stick one direction or another for example my case liked to push the thumb stick down the volume button got pressed somehow and my rhino went mute i promptly cut the plastic away from the buttons problem solved only other problem was fogging between the display and the transparent plastic solved by cutting away more plastic and using adhesive screen protectors messed up the fit a bit too i recommend just using adhesive screen protectors the rhino might get roughed up but the screen will stay ok 
installation nightmare i dont know about the installation on this thing tryed to install this with the bluetooth card supplied and my new hp pavilion with bluetooth built in you would think it would be easy no way after two hours on my own then two hours to a guy in india who did not know anything i gave up boxed it up and sent it back its also bigger then you would expect its not something you can put in a brief case with a laptop its way too big your better off bring a cheap lexmark printer with a usb cable 
bad customer service bad customer service its been almost a month and i still have not received this product ive sent emails and called twice noone really helped me with anything neither did anyone answer the phones i dont even know how to rate the item because i dont have it im pretty sure its really nice its just ive been waiting for almost a month and this is getting frustrating with no help

try to find a port i own a sony vaio computer in the computer there are no ports to put in this cord ended up buying something for money to convert it to a usb connection then i couldn t find a program that would be able to send and receive data to my etrex gps via a usb port was definitely a hassle 
definitely stay away bought this about two months ago never liked it for two reasons the rubber cap is so easy to lose guess that s why it comes with spares though utterly slow ! this is what was most uncomfortable with the drive yeah it s slow only with groups of small files like everyone else said still it s annoying to have to zip a bunch of small files everytime before you copy them over to the drive then unzip when you want to use copy them not practical and now well it just stopped working last week i mean completely for no reason just great like one day before i was going to sell it to someone else stay away from this one 
quality control issues i saw this set at the store and it was a magnificent picture has an integrated hdtv tuner and all the connections you will need looks sweet too however i got one off amazon which was a dud poor picture quality and white light bleed from the top and bottom of the screen a problem another customer complained about samsung telephone service help was great and agreed it was defective amazon was terrific and paid for the return and refund be careful with this set and wait a little for other feedback oh one annoying feature while the hdtv tuner works well you cannot dial in a specific digital channel like unless the search program has previously found it and there is no way to save the found digital channels so that you can reposition the antennae search for signals again and then have a compiled list channels locked into the memory in other words if your search found in one antenna position but not there is no way the tv will let you dial in even if you reposition the antenna optimally you must then reprogram the search to find but then after that is completed you wont be able to dial in after turning antenna back because the tv did not permanently store that channel prior to the new search my sony xbr can do this no problem 
lost budapest photos i was in the middle of my second day of a long awaited trip to budapest when this card died i was using my new canon rebel xt which had no problems with my gb cards throughout my day trip i lost an entire day of photos i would not recommend this product to anyone 
for on compatibility i tried this adapter with two different ipod docking port devices a belkin tunebase fm transmitter for the ipod mini and the ipod connector integrated into my car s pioneer radio with the belkin my shuffle charged but no audio made it through the adapter with my car stereo i got the message ipod communication error on my pioneer display screen so this was a nice concept but the adapter did not work with either of my devices 
memorex blank dvd s in each pack there have been several dvd s that aren t any good too many bad discs in my opinio 
good product fatal software upgrade very very poor service initially my tomtom one was excellent then i made the fatal mistake of allowing tomtom home to automatically upgrade the software the device never worked again because it could no longer find any satellites ! my computer has the maximum security offered by windows xp and norton internet security so it seems unlikely that the process was contaminated in any way on feb i contacted customer service nice courteous responses but no solution finally on their advice i returned it to the retailer on feb it finally arrived at tomtom service on th march that was the last i have heard of it i rang tomtom customer service on nd april and they could not trace the unit over the following weeks i tried a series of faxes and online service queries but have received absolutely no human intervention or assistance in summary i bought a good product the online software stuffed it up and over the following two months tomtom service achieved nothing except for apparently loosing my tomtom postscript finally almost two months after seeking replacement of the faulty item i have been advised that it is to be replaced no apology or expression of regret from tomtom but at least i will have a gps even though i vowed never to tangle with tomtom customer service again and i am free to choose the replacement model and manufacturer i have found that tomtom one still offers the best performance price balance for my purposes i just hope that my new tomtom runs well so that i will not have to be serviced again by tomtom 
poor support for defective mapping engine if tomtom s maps fail and you submit a bug report the nice support site sends you to teleatlas s site which promptly closes the support request it took two requests before i realized i was being redirected away from tomtom s site the real problem is not with the maps which is a good thing but with the mapping engine determine how to find a point on a map i submit the request to the main support group only to have those bozos close the request saying that the problem is with the map at this point i don t care who is wrong since neither tomtom nor teleatlas will say who owns the mapping engine this stupid device failed when i needed it the most driving in new jersey ! the tomtom go cannot map roads that are broken see bug submission below for more information so why two stars it fails when you need it i could scroll around the working map and find the right street but then i need to stop in an unsafe state er i mean place and use the device like it was my trusty aaa map support does not read bug reports i want that job with zero accountability please ! does it work yes it does and it does work very well when you have a nice clean streets with a good map it does take some time to find its gps often but its tolerable it manages to lose signal with tree cover seriously i can still see the sky moral of this review verify with an online map service before driving to unknown places defeats the prupose no tomtom go did find my way around some detours in nj near trenton and get me into the parking garage saving me time and frustration the prupose of this device updatesafter using tomtom go for a few months i have seen more problems than i care for i have recommended everyone in my family to not buy tomtom products the map for my area king of prussia pa more than two years out of date it got my dad lost going to a hotel which is miles away from me in some areas you will fall off the map the most annoying new feature is tomtom alterate route functions i am headed to a fork in a road in the middle of nowhere tomtom wants me to take the long way to my destination by switching from the state route meaning route or route that i m on to the another state route at the fork the thing is if i tell it not to take the other state route the damn device will tell me to turn around once i pass the fork it keeps telling me to turn around when i choose to re run the routing software from where i am it figures out a new route completely passing the road that i need to take the road is on the tomtom map but it won t take it until i get on to it what gives bug report submitted to tomtom tomtom go v the mapping engine is broken it cannot handle a road that is broken into several non contiguous sections the city pennsauken gave several distinct streets the same name destination cooper ave pennsauken nj if you map the destination on any internet site and scroll around you would see that all points map to real locations but are not on the same physical road they are on different roads by the same name in the same city the tomtomgo s map actually has these locations on it but is unable to map to anything but the first occurance of cooper ave cooper ave pennsauken nj trying to find the intersection cross street of two streets cooper ave and park ave does not work even though the tomtom s map clearly shows that they do intersect tomtom can only see the intersection of cooper ave and derousse ave that area has several other streets sherman ave for example that are also non contiguous 
too expensive and my headphones broke in weeks i am a person who actually uses these items alot after weeks of using these headphones the right earpiece quit playing and i hear ms is not suppporting anything that stops operating also it is too expensive i am enjoying the zune but all the accessories should be a little more accessible 
needs redesign mouse does not glide smoothly on some surfaces due to the large depression on the bottom of the mouse designed to hold antenna mine would not glide smooth on rubber mousepad or plastic nor my corrian counter top the idea is good however because when you insert the antenna the mouse turns off this being said it may deserve stars if the correct surface is used 
save your receipt i own a brother hl so of course i have to use this toner cartridge but if i had a choice i d try someone else s the problem is always the same after a few months of great printing and btw i print maybe a couple dozen sheets a week if that a vertical line develops down the left side of every page about three quarters of an inch from the paper s edge don t bother with tech support they ll tell you to clean the corona wire and drum which i did a million times to no avail eventually i gave up went out and purchased another cartridge and voil problem solved for another couple of months anyway and then you have to trash the old cartridge which as you ll be able to tell from shaking it still has a heavy load of toner left in it great little printer lousy little cartridges suppose that s how they make their money though 
i must have different stuff after multiple applications and rereading of directions i can t see any discernable difference maybe with polishing cloth 
review the adapter which allows you to connect your cd player to your car s stereo system worked fine and i am completely satisfied with it the cd player is a different story it repeatedly would not recognize disks that worked fine on a different player or would read a disk for a while but then stop just generally very poor reliability i didn t return it as the adapter was what i needed the most and i had another cd player that worked fine my advice is to buy the adapter by itself and then get a different cd player 
it made it years so long well we had liked this product for the years that it worked we are sending it back under the replacement warranty that we purchased it now sounds like an old vehicle clunking down the road it was used relatively lightly for printing and fax in our small office 
where is it i ordered an hp printer which does not come with a cable on oct th based on advice in the ad for the printer i ordered the subject cable also made by hp in the same order the printer shipped on the th of october an ink cartridge for the printer arrived nov th but i have not received the cable i do not know how to rate the printer or the cable and i have already lost days on the printer s warranty i sure would like to be able to rate the cable and printer to date the order is weeks late since it s estimated shipping date of oct i have not even been able to find a way to contact customer service to see if there is going to be a long lag time in which case i would know that it would be wise to cancel and order from someone else bottom line not satisfactory at the moment 
warning this is not a car holder if you are buying this thinking that you will be able to use this to mount your magellan into another car forget it don t be fooled basically when you buy a magellan you get the unit a mounting cradle and a mounting arm the mounting arm attaches to your windshield with a suction cup the mounting cradle then semi permanently mounts to that mounting arm this cradle allows for easy insertion and removal of the magellan unit if you buy this all you are getting is the cradle without an arm this is a worthless piece of plastic not even a very pretty piece of plastic that could serve as a christmas ornament 
battery and charger i have had it less than a year and charging the battery as with all the palms is a major disappointment they don t last very long palm is great but what is great if it doesn t charge thanks to service plans i have exchanged every palm i have had due to defective batteries now they know better and don t have the plans like they used too my advice buy something with a replaceable battery you can do yourself 
not as advertised on amazon with serious sirius reception problems in my office and no option to mount outside i looked to this antenna to help solve the problem adverstised dimensions as x x inches ounces i thought i was ordering a huge monster antenna the dimensions must be the size of the package it s actually about the same size as the sirius stock antenna with no appreciable improvement in signal reception not worth the price and falsely advertised by amazon 
doesnt play hd only outputs in hd good standard player bought this product to stream hd media from pc usb storage all though advertised on the box and website it does not play the hd media i tried to play the media from all available inputs wireless ethernet and usb hd and several formats that are supported avimpegtsmp the hd movies were choppy at best plays all other non hd videos without a problem divx videos as well even though it doesn t say it plays them on the box worked well with gb usb drive but not needed would not recommend because hd feature is useless dlink technical support said to take it back to the store there technical support grade is d 
not for the non geek user without a doubt the pepper pad has potential but it isn t really ready for prime time it is nicely made and priced well below many of the other ultra portable laptops and umpcs unfortunately the manufacturer still has a significant of issues to work out before the pepper pad rises to the user friendly level it must be at to garner the mass market there are a of software glitches that are also causing user irritation that may or may not be addressed in upcoming software updates if you are not familiar with linux and enjoy the user friendliness of windows there is a relatively steep learning curve linux devotees however love this product they enjoy tearing into the software and souping up their pads you can not print or use officetype applications with this in conclusion if you are fluent in linux don t need to print or use office type applications and are fortunate enough to get a pad devoid of the touch screen problems and with the needed software updates the pepper pad may be for you 
the worst my purchase of bose in ear headphones was the biggest waste of since i was in vegas while the quality of the sound may be good the stupid rubber ear buds are worthless they will not i repeat not stay connected to the actual headphone you get three sizes the largest would perhaps work for shriek the smallest for alfred e neuman after them falling off for the umph teen time i superglued them on to the headphone and sure enough after a couple of days of in and out of my pocket they too fell off ! whoever designed these probably drives a ford pinto one star is much much too generous for this product save you money 
not a quality item this item worked for a while but required fiddling unplugging and replugging repeatedly with the lighter socket each time i restarted my car eventually however it blew out the fuses in both my lighter sockets don t waste your money on this piece of crap 
wireless doesn t work picture quality is poor i spent two days and couldn t get the wireless to work with the camera configured using wired ethernet cable the unit worked fine picture quality is poor and doesn t work in low light i used two infrared light sources and the camera doesn t pick up a picture ptz is kind of cool but it doesn t provide any value if you can t get a decent picture 
year service plan for televisions i purchased the year service contract thru amazon actually years since the st year is covered under warranty i never received a conformation mail from the third party vendor service contracts from newcorp i have called their customer service and am currently waiting for them to send me written confirmation it is also unclear on whether i need to provide them with additional information before my service contract becomes valid since they had no further information about my purchase from amazon eg model number of the tv etc if this is any sign of the type of service i will be receiving i have serious reservations about this service plan 
uncomfortable but it does work bought these to use with the xm myfi they are not comfortable to use they put pressure on your ears now the good news they do get decent reception i tried them in my office in nyc which has a northern exposure and it got good reception 
impossibleto receive sw i bought this radio years ago my worst dollars it is pratically impossible to get short wave station i have tried everything nothing nada also the slide for the volume is terrible you can t control the volume they should remove this radio from the market or at least remove the short wave reception since you can t hear nothing 
you get what you pay for well for i shouldn t have expected much but most of the reviews here were so positive i just couldn t resist what have i got to lose with taxes shipping and handling about the construction of the headset is very flimsy almost toy like but thats ok if handled with care they could still be servicable for some time the real problem was with the sound quality my intended use was for late night tv watching but the bass frequencies are so muddy and rumbling it was annoying to listen to and made voices almost unintelligeble sp 
lacie d hard drive extreme failure gb it looks as tough as a tank but it isn t once it crashed eveyone told me it s a very delicate piece of equipment i did not carry mine around for one it is too heavy i also only fired it up when i did my monthly backups so i didn t have it running all the time so it shouldn t have over heated as others have mentioned but after less than months the computer stopped recognizing it it hums but never gets anywhere i changed the ports bought new cables all to no avail as it happens my computer had failed and i was relying on the lacie back up drive to retrieve my files what a shock when i couldn t get to them tried other computers both macs and pcs and still no sightings of the lacie drive on the desktop even though still under warranty i got no help from the lacie help desk their suggestions to use a data recovery application is unhelpful since i couldn t see the drive to select it they don t even give you a toll free number to call they also expect you to pay to ship the heavy thing to them even under warranty they give no help to retrieve data if you allow anyone to open the case it voids the warranty but they won t send you the hard drive separately even if you send them the item intact and it turns out that it s something else head aches head aches if it worked it would be great but it s not the drive that is important it is the data and if lacie hasn t figured out a way to help clients when their products fail they shouldn t be in this business buyer beware ! i wouldn t buy another lacie ever again also learned my lesson two copies are still not enough especially if one of them is lacie 
not universally compatable i have used this rw with my sanyo dvd recorder the result is that i cound not play the recording it wil freeze up and some times they can not be formatted they will not function well if they are used for the vr mode i have used other brands such as tdk or fuji they are ok 
if you bought the old dymo labelwriter turbo you will be disopointed i have used the old labelwriter turbo for our veterinain praktices for years when finally the first one broke down last month the choice for the new labelwriter turbo was a no brainer atleast we tought how disapointed did we get first of all is was nolonger possible to put the labelwriter off when we went home not good for environment then it became clear that it was no faster then the old labelwriter turbo and even worse it pulls the label forth and back before printing which makes changes of labels gettting stuck in the machine very high which happend to us a lot also when printing to it from another computer it stops just before the end then after a second pushes the last peace of the label true which means for us that we pull the label of the machine to soon and then it gets stuck in error mode the software has lots of problems for example if you repress bad labels in the software it won t print at all my advise look for a diverend labelwriter 
awful product i picked one of these up from the apple store and used it that day not only does the product not broadcast well i had to hold it two feet from my radio it didn t even get a signal in the car on any frequency but it dosent stay in the dock connector the transmitter actually will not lock into the bottom of the ipod the transmitter also appears to turn off after seconds of not touching the buttons the lcd screen turns off so you cannot see the frequency it is transmitting on because it worked so poorly i couldn t tell if it was broadcasting or if it was simply broken an indicator saying whether the transmitter was on or off would be helpful and not a huge battery drain if you want a knockoff transmitter that works only when placed perfectly next to your radio than get this if you want something that works consider the itrip by griffin 
what did i expect for bucks after finally figuring out that i had to turn my mic inputs all the way up i still can t get more than a db signal from my guitar save your money 
unreliable and awful support the printer worked well for a while then after about a month simply spat out two sequential pages of blank paper each time we tried to print with it hp technical support was extremely poor i had to sit through an hour of a fellow called raj saying will you please be pressing this button or that button will you please be turning off the printer and turning it on again and trying out a whole series of inane tests that i told the tech support person i d already tried to no avail finally we were told to return the printer which should not have taken an hour ! and the support guy said please be sending all your printer s accessories and new ink cartridges with the printer please so we did including brand new ink cartridges the duplexer and the rear paper feeder as raj instructed and after a few days received the same printer back minus the duplexing unit the rear paper feeder and the ink cartridges ! it took a lot of cajoling with hp support to have the duplexer replaced and the rear paper feed unit was never replaced at all they claim to have lost it then after a week the printer started malfunctioning again in the exact same way no one in the company can afford to spend the time for raj or his friends to put us through a long series of tests give us misleading information send us an incomplete unit following which we will waste more time engaging in frustrated diplomacy sorting out the mess hp will make it s just not worth it good technical support pays for itself about five fold in customer satisfaction and referrals the standard of hp support was so abysmal that i cannot recommend this printer 
garbage i knew better but i did it anyway thinking that it would be a good compromise we have ibm dell and toshiba laptops and a sony really nice monitor no modem port not a surprise but would have been nice the video display is well you can see stuff on the monitor one of the usb ports isn t reliable i could go on but you get the picture don t bother 
short life time after few months it just stopped working also it is not rechargable and need to replace batery every week 
terrible sound i ve now returned two of these for the same problem a terrible screeching sound the first unit did it constantly and the second did it intermitently especially between songs one unit is a quality problem two units is a design problem 
timex xm radio this antenna does not fit the timex xm clock radio antenna port therefore you must guess which xm radios it might fit 
months and no longer works like other users have experienced this unit is no longer functional after months the wired base is still working but the wireless range extender no longer fires up all led lights poor product netgear 
not mac compatable purchased this item was thrilled that it was so inexpensive cable got here i take it out of the package it s too short to use with my windows xp desktop pc unless i want my ipod nano sitting on the floor under and slightly behind my desk it does work but i ve got a longer better cable for that same purpose but that s ok we bought it as a second cable so that my husband can use it with his apple ibook and his mac os formatted ipod video so he plugged the cable into his ipod and into every different usb port on his ibook nothing happens this cable is not compatable with macs ! if you re not a windows user don t bother it won t work for you i had to get a refund for mine the seller was nice enough to give a refund without my having to even send the cable back since i suppose it would have ended up costing them more to reimburse me for shipping it back to them than it did to just give me my money back the product page needs to specify that this is a windows only compatable cable although if i hadn t experienced it myself i probably wouldn t have believed it that a cable can work with one os but not another 
like everyone says weak pins i have disconnected this cable two times only to temporarily relocate the tv and guess what yes one of the pins got bent and broke off now this expensive cable is just a worthless piece of junk don t by this monster cable try a different brand 
poor item the only reason i even gave it one star was that it did turn on the battery lasts about hour fully charged which is just sad i could not communicate with a vessel that was mile from me which again is sad spend a little more money and get a better product 
poor sound i have already sent the t v back to toshiba to have the volumn repaired the t v is in the kitchen and you cannot hear it at max volumn feet away after being repaired its no bette 
no usb cable included i bought this printer as part of a package the package included the computer monitor and printer i didn t really need the printer but the price was great for the computer monitor and the printer was basically a freebie i hooked up the computer system i thought about the printer i already had it was older and jammed once in a while when i was printing so i decided what the heck i ll hook up the new printer i unboxed it and was starting to hook it up i looked for the usb cable i couldn t find it started examining the styrofoam packing materials to see if it was shoved in some crevise or other no cable then i looked on the instructions and the show the contents of the box printer power cord cartridges and docs software they didn t show a usb cable on the outside of the box they also show contents and in tiny little print it says usb cable not included what kind of cheap manufacturer doesn t include a usb cable with a usb printer it s not like i have a choice of whether to go usb or parallel the printer only does usb without a usb cable the printer is a paperweight in order to use this printer for anything you will have to buy a usb cable ! why didn t they include one it is just stupid 
don t buy the psus i ve a psus for over two years now i m awaiting the return of a forth replacement unit from linksys they stream my lan and kill connections linksys tried to claim the warranty was one year even though the pdf on their web site states three years when i cross shipped the last return they charged my credit card early and then took forever to refund the money now they claim the unit is on back order for over six weeks already this is the last linksys component in my lan i ve replaced every other device with other brands linksys stinks 
way radio not up to mile range we bought these units specifically to take on a cruise ship there was not one minute on any of the many channels that we did not experience interference pick up other way users or had no signal at all we were so dissatisfied that we returned them to amazon for refund 
how sad i purchases this karaoke machine for my daughters th birthday i gave it to her first thing this morning only to be very disappointed and sad to find out that it too like the other two people that purchased and reviewed it didn t work the cds didn t even turn around the microphones worked my daughter was very sad that we had to return it i think that it should be recalled i purchased it at toys r us and they took it right back without any problem i wish i had opened it to make sure it worked after i read those reviews 
wish it would work ! defective item received times this item was a gift to be used at our family holiday festivities we put it together it sounded and looked great but the cd player was defective contacted amazon on christmas day a new one was shipped cd player was defective yet again now we are waiting for a new one both times i communicated that the shipping packaging may be the problem i recommend this machine but buy it from a store not amazon i just wish there was someone in my area that sold it ! 
overpriced underprotected just received the flex skin and my first thought is that this is way over priced this is a piece of soft plastic that will do very little to protect the unit it will protect against scratching but only the areas of the unit you re not really concerned about the screen is totally exposed so it can be scratched when in the unit i m sure that s so you can see the screen better but a clear protective cover that can open and close over the screen would have been nice anyway at this is too much to spend i m ordering a leather cover with a kick stand which by the way you need if you want to stand it up on your desk or on a table for less than the price of this product i feel i just flushed bucks down the drain hopefully you will not 
incompatiblr incompatible with my ibook apple has such a phobia against providing system requiremts for their accessories finally found the list on a vendors website amazon did not have this list one has to do major resarch to find the info apple won t provide ! 
unit keeps reporting incorrect password dispite having a confirmed that i have working skype account tested via a computer and usb phone the cit which has been correctly set up as per all included instructions keeps returning an incorect password message every time i try to log into skype with it no i am not trying to log in when my pc is logged into skype and yes i am sure that i ve keyed in the correct skype name and password into the phone linksys outsourced tech support is useless they can do no more then rundown the same checklist that you can find yourself it all comes down to reset the phone reset the base station and it does not work im sure that there has to be an identifiable reason for this to be happening but i ll be returning the phone if skype tech support who i hope just might have a clue can offer no suggestions 
works great for a few months then it is crap easy to set up and worked great for months then it just stopped working horrible customer service ! will never buy from this company again ! 
believe the negative reviews if after reading all the negative reviews you say this product can t possibly be this bad like i did well you d be wrong even the strongest fm stations that come in perfectly clearly with the cheapest throwaway radios are garbled noisy and static y on this radio this product is a blot on sony s reputation 
very poor quality device i normally don t like to write bad reviews however i m compelled to do so for the linksys wcg version due to the chronic instability of the device im truly sorry i bought this device and i m frustrated at linksys since they do not appear to be offering any firmware updates to fix the issues both my wife and i work from home so device outages are readily apparent we have a comcast broadband connection that has proved reliable since we got it in until we bought the wcg we were using separate devices for the cable modem router and wireless functions and decided to upgrade to the wcg since it has all three functions integrated below is a list what i have observed in the last months of using the wcg i ve found several internet posts that detail similar issues for other folks there seems to be a correlation of these issues with comcast users however that may not be conclusive since comcast has such large market share frequent crashing of the device when wireless users are connected the device will often stop responding and require a reboot when we re using its wireless capabilities this occurs several times per day if we don t use the wireless the crashes still occur however they are markedly less frequent i ve also noticed that changing the wireless security settings seems to change the frequency of crashes the device would crash hourly when using wpa or wpa security the administration pages stop responding after the device has been running for some time usually about a day or two in this case the unit will still process traffic however i must reboot it to get into the administration interface the administration pages when working sometimes stall for seconds the modem log doesn t always work properly i ve cleared the log and had old entries come back after a reboot to be fair linksys does make other devices that work better i ve been a linksys customer for several years while i ve seen quality issues before they usually come out with a firmware upgrade to address them 
does not work with docking station these speakers do not work with the laptop i have more specifically a dell latitude d with docking station it works with the just the laptop but not through the docking station whacked so i dont know what they sound like yet beware that they have bugs 
don t buy very poor quality on my rd set i originally purchased this hdtv back in september but it had to be replaced because the digital tuner atsc was defective and the atsc would crash while i was watching digital tv so the picture would freeze and i would have to restart the tv to watch digital tv olevia replaced that defective tv with a new tv same model and it worked fine for about months now it has an unsightly thin vertical blue line going threw the middle of the screen so now olevia has to replace my tv for a second time in months i ve never experienced such poor quality electronics in my life and i will never buy another product from olervia syntax i would give this product stars if i could dont buy this 
successfully burned cds out of a spindle of this is the second time i ve been dumb enough to buy these both times i saw an uncluttered surface no loud logos and the sony brand name and assumed it d be good quality only after my burning software failed again again and then my cd drive stopped recognizing any discs at all until rebooting did i realize that i d been through this before with sony discs a year ago i can t imagine what could possibly make these so bad i ve used just about every other kind of discs with no problem reading the other reviews here makes me realize it s not just me it s pretty upsetting that i ve wasted or so on these things for a grand total of maybe usable discs 
expensive and no good i must say i bit into this senheiser scheme i paid a lot of money on a product that should not cost that much first of all i should say that i only paid dollars for it and i still think it is much more than it is worth now the problems it is called open air design or something like that bottom line is everybody in the room and the neighboring rooms can hear what you are listening what is the purpose of the headphones then i could play my games using the speakers and have a better experience the highs are too high and the lows are too low first time you use them you say oh it sound great but after a time it gets annoying these are supposed to be audiophile ones i play my guitar sometimes at at night this was the reason for the new headphones i got tired of my old ones they had a very short wire now the problem is i use a lot of distortion and because the highs are too high and so on they are horrible i went back to my old ones and i am only using these with my computer during the day or when nobody is at home anyway my opinion is that i should have bought the phillips model that i used to have before these 
didn t last long what a waste of money try buying something else this lasted me only a couple of months 
broke twice i bought this months ago and while i had some problems with the set up i got help from the store where i bought it it has really nice sound but it has a serious problem not once but twice when my children inserted dvds in the player they would not eject ! since no one could service it locally i went to places and each claimed they could fix it but then later admitted they couldn t since they would have had to open it up i had to send it to bose that cost a lot plus bose charges a minimum of about i forget the exact amount to even look at it now the exact same thing has happened this is the second episode they say you can repair this easily but i went through the recommended procedures with a bose technician over the phone and it didn t work there s no way i m sending this machine back to them i m getting something else ! any recommendations finally lest you think the kids are somehow to blame let me note that they work daily with other dvds cd roms cd players and personal computers and have never had any problems with any of them i normally don t like having to pay extra for a warranty but if you insist on getting this product i d recommend buying it from a place that sells it with a warranty 
i ve had problems too i set up a wireless network with the belkin wireless n router and three computers containing the desktop card the first two worked fine although they ve been lightly used they re both within feet of the router the third computer unfortunately my main desktop is located about feet away on the same floor down an open hallway it s hard to know exactly what s going on because the computer freezes periodically with the desktop card installed when it doesn t lock up it has video problems and switches into some god awful default mode all three computers are running windows xp but my computer is the only one to have these problems during the brief intervals when i m actually able to bring up the belkin wireless networking utility it either shows the wireless network with minimal signal or the wireless network doesn t show up at all i ve uninstalled reinstalled updated drivers and everything i can think of to no avail i also have a laptop running the pc card n adapter it works ok but the signal varies between good and poor again in the same room feet away from the router needless to say this has been a discouraging experience and has soured my impression of belkin as well as n unfortunately as i ve read reviews of competing products they all seem just as bad i think i m going to break down and run a wire to my bedroom and drop the wireless desktop effort for now 
junk dvd player worked great for about a month after that it stopped powering up dont buy 
crippled design requires installation of bloated software on every windows machine you want to transfer files too only works with a windows machine from the manual of which i couldn t copy and paste from because it is copy protected a note states tracks that have been digitally recorded on a hi md device and then imported to sonicstage cannot be written to audio cd so if you hook up a digital mixer to the md to record your band you are out of luck transfers to and from the computer often fail and corrupt your file the manual states tracks that have been recorded on a hi md walkman can be imported to sonicstage only once so you re out of luck if there is a power outage while transferring that recording of your band s greatest live performance from the manual tracks transferred to the the md from another computer cannot be transferred back to my library on your computer so god forbid if you actually use more then one computer to manage your the audio you record with this device 
not reliable the only good thing about this product is its price i saw it being sold at on some other site there are several shortcomings though the greatest drawback is the complexity of the menu there is no home location also there are only two navigation options available shortest time shortest distance so if you are caught in a traffic jam for example there is no detour function also you cannot see the next few turns when you are navigating hence you cannot plan if you immediately need to turn right after a left or vice versa the maps are probably very old i used this device in nj va mn in every state i faced problems multiple times when the unit did not know that the road bifurcated ahead it would not tell me to keep on left right or it would ask me take turns when there were none the unit was very slow in calculating routes i dont know how the sirf star iii chip helps also it would freeze often i would need to reset it at critical junctions the viamichellin website is only dedicated to europe when i went to register my product i had to register it in viamichellin uk since there was no option for us ! i dont think they have any support for the us models the pois are very less compared to other competitors within the same price range i returned this product after trying to make it work for months it was great on part of amazon to accept it even after expiration of return policy although they deducted restocking fee 
not worth the price shipping i bought these head phones because i read all the reviews that gave it s and s so i expected a lot out of them the truth is you really shouldn tthey don t sound particularly awesome and i was rather disappointed that i actually spent close to after shipping and stuff the mid highs and highs sound fine but i had issues with bass and mid low response especially when i plugged it into my computer plus they are not super comfortable either the hinges nip at your neck when you don t have them on your head and they fit funny if you have glasses all in all i wished i had spent my money on something else but they do look pretty cool 
average performance installation was very easy but i had later troubles with this unit but after reinstalling the driver it was ok performace is average 
sound cuts out after under months after light use less than once a week for under months the sound began to cut out i noticed it would cut out over of the time i was listening either entirely or a large portion of the sound range would suddenly dissapear usually mid range vocals and below would cut out if the cord was held just right it would come back for a few seconds but then cut back out also they are slightly tight on the ears while wearing glasses 
wrong adaptor i like the other customers ordered this adaptor based on the recommendation from the site and was disappointed when on christmas eve i realized this was not right for the keyboard we had ordered this situation was particularly misleading since the adaptor was practically bundled for sale with a product for which it is not compatible 
stop and save your money i waited a while before submitting a review to give this unit a good try i already had a portable unit garmin but wanted an in dash unit for my other car at the time this unit was twice as much as the garmin but it also played dvds i was very disappointed once i got this unit which cost twice as much as the portable and more than most of the other units of the market the biggest disappointment was that he does not guide you a fraction as well as any of the portable units on the market the garmin will take you right to the door of the address you put in this unit if it can find the address gets you there and says you have arrived but where which side of the street which building etc my garmin will take me right to my own front door and this expensive unit gets me in the area and then i am left to figure out which building all having unique addresses i am looking for the detachable controls for the unit would make you feel that you paid for the unit it feels like it is mostly plastic and that it couldn t cost them very much to make the radio unit i had in the car prior had a great detachable unit with its own carrying case you get no such thing with pioneer i thought that was a bit cheap of pioneer not to even include a carrying case for such an expensive unit the interface with the unit is awkward and time consuming when you put in an address it apparently searches in both the state of washington where i live and in oregon i called pioneer to ask if i could just search in washington since i didn t care about the addresses in other states at this time and when i did i could just put that state in by the way this is a regular feature on the portable units pioneer tap dances around the answer but the bottom line is no what can you expect from the only unit on the market where you have to put over to the side of the road and apply parking brakes multiple times before switching addresses i would get into the problems pioneer has with getting its map upgrades out again something i spoke to them about and you should hear the song and dance they give on that however if that was the only thing wrong with paying twice as much for a unit that delivers half as much as the portable units i would just complain to pionner save money if you want a good reliable gps unit look at either the portable units or one of the other brands of in dash ones as for the built in dvd players you can get one of those put in your car for a fraction of the price remember you can always take back one of the portable units but with the pioneer you have put out an extra to get it installed as well so no real taking it back i urge you to shop carefully if you are at all looking at purchasing this unit on a positive note it is fun to watch the screen come out and pop up with you first turn it on but i am not sure that the price was worth that 
only bought because imation sonix stopped making their label no where near as easy to use as my old system but with trial and error can have a decent amount of control over your projects but one interesting thing someone mentioned earlieris that regardless of with system you use these labels can alterthe way dvds play making them stick and freeze and wondering if its the disks burner or what after some experimenting i didconfirm that it was actually the labels i was having so much fun making it might be the weight but i think its possibly the way the beam shines through the disc and reflects off the white label backing dunno but if you all of a sudden start having problems try a labeling tape or a sharpie 
danger will robinson not compatible with linksys wireless pci adapter okay it s late and i m crabby after wrestling with a wireless network for most of the day i bought this bad boy to strengthen the signal for my network a few really insanity making points first as several other reviewers have pointed out apparently you can hook this thing up to your router not that the directions tell you that though the directions only show connecting to a free standing pc how silly of me to think i could follow the directions i popped over to my local microcenter and bought a linksys pci card and this hsb ill usually try and stay with the same brand but microcenter had neither a linksys signal booster or a hawking pci adapter if indeed either company makes such a beastie i got home from the store slapped the linksys pci adapter in fired up the computer and went to connect the hsb things were going too smoothly as soon as i unscrewed the antenna from the pci adapter the signal disappeared which is to be expected i then connected the hsb and still nothing rebooted still nothing checked hawking s website no user forums no nothing checked amazon thinking that i might get some good tech advice the reviews say you can put it on the router what a concept i unscrew the antenna on the router a linksys wrtgs only to discover that the hsb connector doesn t fit argh i call the tech support from the back of the manual wrong search the web find the right i call and after a fairly short wait a pleasant surprise i get a guy from india no surprise there i can usually understand these guys but the connection was horrific had to start phonetically spelling everything like a wwii fighter pilot kilo bravo whiskey foxtrot anyway the tech support guy right away starts talking me through the router end of things i told him that i was following the directions im goofy that way and trying to connect to a pci card after a short stint on hold mr tekkie informs me that the hsb is incompatible with the linksys pci adapter this despite the hsb package that says also works with other certified wireless network adapters and devices with removable antennas except that it doesn tsomr tekkie then suggests i try to hook up the hsb to the router end of things at which point i inform him that the connectors are incompatible another short moment on hold and he comes back and tells me that i need a hacst coupler to connect the hsb to the linksys router will the hsb be compatible with the router even though it s not compatible with the pci adapter i ask tekkie assures me that it will be amazon lists a hacst coupler at about usd cant wait to see what my local microcenter hammers me for it for installing my network i at least had the wisdom to buy locally so i could return things easier when i go and pick up the hacst it ll be trip for the network i might return the hsb or i might pick up the hacst i m too tired to decide right now whichever i decide and i ll update the saga as it unfolds this hsb is getting one star for compatibility issues and inexcusable documentation and a user unfriendly website stay tuned update see my comment that follows this review for an update

don t like it at all i think this is a very bad wireless mouse it didn t work wireless for me even though i charged the battery for more than hours according to the manual so i had to connect the recharging cable with it all the time that makes it a wired mouse the buttons on the receiver and mouse are so tiny that you have to use a pen or something to press it the battery cover is hard to open this mouse does not have a sensitive signal the motion of the cursor lags behind your mouse terrible mouse ! 
battery problem i am very unhappy with this panasonic model as well the battery never gets fully charged even though the indicator says someting different the phone keeps indicating tobe placed near the base even when it is like a hairline of a distance away this phone can die on you and i have changed the batteries for both my handsets times in the last months ! i would never recommend it 
lose the belt clip i recently bought this product for my palm tx and was equally disappointed as well as annoyed with the cheap belt clip it isn t apparent in the photos but there is a screw attached to the back of the case which makes it impossible to lay flat this i found extremely annoying the clip which you can take on and off is extremely cheap and doesn t secure well it flops and swirls around otherwise the case would be fine i do not recommend 
incompatible with my burner this media did not work on my brand new asus burner even after updating the firmware 
keyboard works on mac software doesn t the keyboard does a nice job as a usb unit the packaging does a less than stellar job of clearly stating up front that none of the educational software is written for the mac 
good from far far from good as a new skype user i wanted to have a headset to talk and listen at the same time however i didn t want one of those bulky headsets that go over both ears i looked at this product which looked great ! i love the look of it and how it seems it will fit right over the ear snuggly it also has reviews claiming it is the greatest thing ever i thought i found the perfect lil headset and i mentioned it to a friend who was also new to skype and ordered one for each of us well it came and like a kid in a candy shop i went at it the ear piece doesnt fit nicely it was very klunky and uncomfertable unlike those sony over theears and some bluetooth headsets i tried looking past that and connected the cables to my computer as i had itunes playing some music i right away heard the sound which was ok i suppose for a cheap headset but not as good as basic earbuds then i made some test calls and no one could hear me unless i was yelling i do not like to yell everytime i am speaking to someone and this piece of trash is being returned asap bottom line is do not buy this either go for a headset that goes over both ears with a proper mic or if you dont mind your calls coming off your computers speakers just buy a mic i am ordering a logitech usb microphone from amazon and i will review that seperately after it arrives 
do not order this item from blueproton the product is fine but the shipping costs are astromical i put in an order and subsequently canceled due shipping costs of for a dollar order that is lucky to weigh a few ounces my advise is to not to order from blueproton till revise their shipping rates 
slow and noisy i have this printer in my office and am considering replacing it with an epson i has a lot of features espcially for the price ie direct input from a camera or a memory card but it is very slow and noisy the print quality is very good as are most ink jet printers in this price range but it is very slow and noisy did i say slow and noisy 
shame on epson many thanks amazon i bought my epson printer cx last yr thrilled w it and the price because i was using mostly color however the thrill is gone now my experience has been exactly the same as the other reviews only i thought i had done something wrong when the brand new black ran out and after cleaning the nozzels the color was gone and it didn t tell me which color i had to replace if i hadn t seen these other reviews i may have taken it into my repair place and spent a bundle tyring to find out why too bad we can t send these all in one reviews to epson thanks very much for the forum 
mismailed tomtom one charger i love the tom tom one and very highly recommend it however the extra electrical charger i ordered does not adapt to the tom tom one as i am miles away from home the electric charger is a disappointment but the tom tom one is terriffic it makes adjustments to my wrong turns and keeps me on track i m thinking seriously of buying a second one for my wife as soon as i get back home 
utter disappointment my adesso cybertablet was very disappointing i had to have the computer guy come in to install the software and the only way he could was by downloading software that wasn t even given to us with the tablet but even after that the software would have to be reinstalled every time the tablet was plugged in to a different computer over a short period of time the tablet started to lag and it would draw messy grainy and skipping lines it was almost impossible to make one line with one single stroke of the pen to accomplish one grainy line you would have to use the tablet very very slowly in no time at all the mouse was broken and the pen was doing wierd tricks with my photoshop if you pressed the pen down against the tablet surface a gigantic pattern would appear on the page the pattern resembled a slinki i thought it was really wierd eventually the pen s cursor would get stuck up in the top left of my screen near the applications menu so i couldn t do anything i am now in the process of e mailing adesso to ask some questions about what i can do 
good product but only lived a short life year it was a great product when it worked sleek design super user friendly sharp image and easily unlock to all region never had any problem loading or playing until last week went completely dead for no reason in the middle of a movie swallowed the dvd with it it would ve been a greater product if it lived pass year at least 
more trouble than it s worth this is a gadget with more promise than delivery it was a retirement gift to me and i m sure glad that not a penny from my pocket went toward the purchase difficult to operate and the end product is not worth the trouble you have been warned 
over hyped over priced if apple makes everthing works as it advertized then it s worth it 
hp ripoff this printer is a piece of junk the print mechanism is constructed of flimsy plastic so that unless care is taken in inserting the print cartridges the mechanism is likrly to be damaged like other hp printers operating under xp it is almost impossible to cancel a pring job in case of a problem e g paper jam paper out cancelling a print job results in a deleting document message which remains until printer is disconnected you can turn it off under these circumstances and computer is rebooted often xp hangs up and the computer must be poered off withexiting windows properly which results in a long diskcheck on repowering i have long had this problem with an older hp model but had hoped they had corrected this problem in their software by now but alas the crown of it all is the life of the ink cartridge the tricolor cartridge costing about at wal mart lasts for about x photos before the ink low warning comes up in sumarry don t buy this printer whatever the price it would probably be wise to avoid hp inexpensive printers altogether 
rodney the concept of the unit is that you can use your house wiring as the carrier for the signal the problem with the design is that it cannot overcome the physics of electricity netgear does not clearly explain that you cannot push the signal past the homes breaker system in their ads and hence the only way this system works is if your router is on the same circuit as the adapter new homes break up room equipment loads into smaller circuits for safety virtually stopping the use of a system like this my complaint for netgear is that this is not put out there as a significant technical consideration although i continued to use their router i had to go wireless to make the system work and wasted money and time getting to the solution 
everything nice except most important feature this would have been a nice phone set but the reception was awful ! i got static sound no matter where i was in relation to the base and no matter where i put the base in the house the manual said to place it away from electrical objects such as microwaves and tv s first of all it is hard to do that nowadays second i did try to move the base and little units around but i got no change in reception quality otherwise this would have been a really great phone 
won t fit your ipod don t bother with this product i purchased the dlo action jacket neoprene for gb ipods for my wife for use on walks etc around town however the ipod doesn t fit in properly the circle that is supposed to line up with the ipod s doesn t the plasic part covering the ipod is awkward and doesn t align either so you can t press the play button so since the ipod doesn t fit in the case overall this product is useless pls save your time and money and consider another ipod case 
it aint no keytar but it dud lay kick hmm it doesnt sound much like a grande piano two me more of like a strange drumset sometimes or a synthy or people claping at me when i didnt even play anything i push le button hard wild hooooogg 
no audio punch through the remote would be fine except it will not allow you to punch through the volume to your receiver only your tv this makes the whole thing pretty useless our home theater like almost everyone s uses our surround theater for sound why you can t punch through the volume controls to it is completely baffling i did a web search and it s apparently baffling to everyone else as well back to the store it goes ! utterly worthless 
not so great i wear these headphones at work for several hours a day and i don t find them very comfortable for extended use the wire that is hidden in the back plastic piece has begun to slip out in places plus the ear pieces are a little large and shiney in the middle so i feel like an insect when i m wearing them 
worst warranty service i have ever experienced this tv has a great picture and would be a star rating if it had acceptablewarranty service i bought this tv in december and it worked great for about a month the cooling fan for the bulb started malfunctioning and would only allow the tv to work for a few minutes before shutting it down i reported the problem to samsung and have waited for three weeks with no resolution they say the reason for the delay is the lack of a local authorized repair center to perform the in home repair i have no idea of how much longer i will have to wait before i get my tv replaced or repaired i cannot recommend samsung because of their poor warranty service buy a sony ! 
there are better options that cost less i m sorry to say that this product failed to meet my expectations prostight connection to laptopcons too easy to accidentally change the combination which makes it difficult to set the combo and remove the lock this product is built to fit on the right side of a laptop if you re laptop is like mine where the plug is on the left side you have to turn the laptop around in order to unlock it unless you don t mind doing it backwards 
looks good but the player came in excellenct condition exactly what we were looking for compact sturdy a pleasure to look at easy for a yearold to use but as a previous reviewer commented it refused to play all songs on any cd inserted out of songs it only played i tried many different cds but to no avail my product was returned the day after i received it 
one broke other complete fuzz i purchased these speakers about a year ago if you d like to know what your likely useable time is with these speakers feel free to use this example i m on amazon right now buying replacements another brand for these that have completely failed they worked fine at first then got fuzzier one quit completely tonight no power nothing the other still works with lots of fuzz i find myself re tuning the signal a lot time for a replacement if you intent to use wireless speakers spend some extra bones and get a different brand i m trying the acoustic research aw s now they supposedly have better range don t settle for cheap unless you have to you ll probably be replacing them in a year if your patience lasts that long ! don t say we didn t warn you 
poor product technical support is even worse if you are looking for a reliable quality switch look elsewhere the first switch we received was doa tech support turn around was more than a week and they ship ups ground as a result we had to rely on an old hub for over two weeks ! the new switch worked well for about two weeks then it too failed if you need a reliable workgroup switch look somewhere else we gave up and replaced ours with a bay networks netgear fs switch for about the same money and we can rest easy with good support so far it hasn t broken either 
not all that it s ok at best the ugly white cord and white antenna make for a real eye soar i can t see how it would look good anywhere except your kitchen 
coby tv the price was reasonable the screen size is great the few channels that did come in had a great picture and the sound was great my only problem is it automatically tuned into channels so my local channels did not all come in only the spanish stations came in clearly and i do not understand spanish it does not have a dial for you to go to channels and that is a big draw back seeing our yr plus old portable tv has that feature and all my local channels come in on that one this tv would be perfect if they can make one with a dial for channels and not auto tune 
ordered ten packs tried different chargers only batteries worked i had heard some good things about lenmar nimh batteries about two years ago but had bought another brand this time around with the good price on amazon i gave these lenmar batteries a try i ordered two ten packs only out of batteries would accept a charge i tried an energizer charger a lacrosse bc charger and a ripvan lightning pack n charger the lacrosse is a high end charger including diagnostics on batteries voltage etc displayed for each battery none of these would charge of the batteries even in the recovery modes available on the ripvan and lacrosse returned the batteries to amazon 
one terrible product i bought this because i have a toshiba and toshibas are notoriuos for having bad air circulation i didn t know this until i d had the laptop for over years i thought it was just mine this is a terrible product its cheap and plastic there are three fans but one hardly ever works and the other two barely move it isn t wide enough for the feet on my laptop to sit on it so my laptop sits directly on top of it not allowing for any type of air flow also the fans are not placed very well nowhere near my computer s two fans 
beware i have an infiniti g coupe and have been using a standard cassette adapter just fine based on this i felt that the smartdeck would be a great upgrade however it would not work at all ! no sound no skipping tracks nothing it just switches fron side a to side b and then ejects the price was great but you may have to return it be prepared 
this product has serious deficiencies jewel cases are diffucult to open and are extremely fragile 
bad cable the test i used this longer gold plated cable to replace a shorter non gold plated s video cable the result i saw a much more grainy picture delivered only in black and white i tried several different inputs and outputs but the problems were fixed only when i removed this belkin cable and replaced it with the older generic cable the verdict this cable delivers substandard picture quality and robs you of viewing video in color it does not work fine as attested by other reviews if you don t want to shell out the cash for a higher quality s video cable upwards of six ft stick with less expensive a v cables 
waste of money not very user friendly limited vocabulary finally threw it away when it got stuck on turkish which was a language i have no use for hope there is a better product out there as the concept is good 
two single packs cheaper than one double i cannot believe they will not change the price single packs are cheaper than double pack i have told them several times that www staplescom has it for and www officemaxcom has it for and with a order free shipping too when they can meet or beat this price i ll buy from them amazoncom if i run out before i ll go elsewhere 
use it carefully first of all as proved by many computer experts the performance wi fi and x devices are far less reliable than mbps ethernet nics if you decided to buy one bgn router in order to get the wireless convenience be prepared to face the inconvenience of some new problems i have used several brands and models of wireless routers including linksys belkin and netgear in the past three years none of them were perfect and i had to spend some time to figure out how to work around some technical problems this one is my latest router and i have been using it for five months i have to say this one has many functions that i like it is usable but the reliability is not good i really spent some time to find the firmware upgrade web page from belkin as the automatic upgrading function seemed not working belkin does not have a direct link from the product page of this model the reason that i was trying to upgrade the firmware was that the router didn t support wi fi constantly and pushing the reset button or rebooting the router didn t always help after the firmware upgrade it still has some problems including the web mode to configure the router does not work in many popular browsers such as firefox if an administrator password is enabled every time after i input the password it will report error but thank god i found opera browser works in my linux system sometimes even though i set up the administrator password i can still configure the router without inputting the password this is definitely a security hole the router doesn t support cookies instead it uses ip address to recognize a user but ip address can be customized easily by anybody who wants to initiate an attack the dhcp for wan internet does not work well all the time when electricity is out for several seconds it may take a long time to get the dhcp work that means you may not be able to get online for minutes even though your cable or dsl connection is totally fine to avoid this problem i use static ip for both wan if allowed by isp and lan since this router also has functions such as port forwarding and several wpa modes which is much safer than wep i will continue to use it but very carefully 
low range i left behind my d link dwl mbps when i was on vocation which work great for me over a year after read all the reviews i decided to give this one wusbgs a try the signal range was dispointed dlink dwl have much better range setup with push button with linksys secure easy setup is easy with linksys router but i lost connection on my other laptop pc which is not linksys wireless adapter i go back to re setup my laptop than this adapter on desk top lost connection because of changing setting on the linksys router one way or another i spend hours still unable to make both adapters work with linksys g router 
did not work this did not work what so ever don t please don t buy it and waste your money on it vance william 
brother dr replacement drum cartridge i received the cartridge however it was a bad one they said they would send postage to send it back and when they received it they would send a new one i still have not received a new one and i have not heard from the company it has been quite a while i will not be buying products from this company again 
mine broke quickly ! software is terrible i agree with all the other feedback saying this product is faulty the on off button is terrible it takes tries to turn the unit off after months of using this the unit would no longer talk with the satellites i sent it back to delorme it tested bad now i have waited weeks for a replacement that is backordered customer service rep will not refund your purchase after days ! the software claims it will compute driving routes for you but it will crash your pda instead i had to buy inav iguidance software which is outstanding to get software that will actually compute road routes for me i would not recommend this product to anyone it has been a complete waste of money for me 
do not but this phone the caller i d has no light the caller i d requires batteries if you are on a call and your call waiting beeps the phone does not tell you who s calling don t waste a dime not a dime period 
don t like it my sister bought this for me for xmas i m not crazy about them there okay but you can t talk on both at the same time which stinks for my kids talking to grandma they do have alot of static and the range if you can say they have any is horriable i can go farther with my older cordless phone these i can t even walk outside my old phone i can go anywhere outside and it works great i would not recommand these phones you can get better phones for the same price or less keep looking 
this product doesn t work on my board and is supports a short list of boards can someone tell me what boards can i buy for this memory 
stay away from this brand i ve not found anything from memorex that works right try maxell products from amazon you can t find better products and the best customer service on the net 
really not worth your money and its overpriced i was very interested in buying this product even before it came out but i have to say i am disappointed this product does not offer any thing that a digital watch timing your run a play list that is constructed before you run and figuring our your miles before you run on the street and it is even less useful if you are going on a treadmill i say less useful on the treadmill because it keep track of the distance for you and when running on the street its not that hard to chart out a running path for you before you go out and run this product is not the breakthrough that a lot of people think it is i am a fan of apple products have owned ipod ibooks an imac and a macmini but after buying this product i have decided to sell it because it doesn t do any thing that can do on your own i don t think that my mind would change if they added a heart monitor because you know that they up charge for that probably into the dollar range i have been running for the past months on a daily basis and have run k k and half marathons in the past

cd changer died can t get a replacement part for warrantee like many others here my cd changer died after a couple of weeks and it wouldn t read any cd it s in for repair but they say the changer part is on national back order and they don t know when they will be available no surprise i guess given the number that are breaking the jvc parts web site says the changer is not available for more than weeks i hope they will replace my unit with something that works 
bad cables i hooked up the cables and they worked one day then i had to get rid of them bad choice on my part it would have cost me more to send them back than what they are wort 
wgx prone to hardware failure i purchased a wgx about months ago the first unit i purchased failed after a few months netgear replaced it because it was under warranty the replacement unit worked nicely for about months then it failed too with pretty much the same symptoms the unit only has a one year warranty so netgear told me i would have to buy another i m not going to do that because the units don t seem to last and i don t want to have to buy another one every months or so ive seen a number of reviews on various sites by other customers who have had the same experience be warned 
wrong protection plan amazon recommends the apple protection plan for the ipod shuffle nd generation be advised the apple store offers a yr plan for just the ipod nano nd gen and ipod shuffle nd gen both plans work great if you have one of these two new machines save yourself 
muddy sound you will be surprised how crummy this sounds compared to the panasonics that cost about the same this is my main problem the sound quality sucks compared to the competition out there the speakers are lightweight and shoddily built they sound muddy and the deep bass from them is nothing to write home about they are fairly light weight meaning very small magnets in them these are way speakers for really good sound on the cheap speakers need to be way the sound input consists of a headphone type jack in front not even standard phono inputs at the back its advertised as watts which is meaningless since the speakers suck what good is a high power amp with crappy speakers and in case you know some audio watts is only twice as loud as watts log relationship for some reason this is not even half as loud as my w receiver no user adjustable equalizer only presets possible cannot connect a different pair of speakers to upgrade because of the biamping type of connections the receiver sucks even my sandisk flash player seems to have a better receiver i concur with the other reviewer death to sony ! shame on them for taking consumers for a ride this company nowadays makes it stuff for ultra cheap and prices it competively with the others meaning fat profit margins 
ritz camera sucks i m sure this product is fine but don t order it through amazon through ritz camera they just cancelled my order without warning having listed that the bag was available freaking idiots 
scans ok but very poorly constructed first let me say that i could not review this product completely as it quit working after about scans minutes after charging it for the first time i did have the chance to perform scans at dpi as well as in black and white and bit color i was also able to install the software and import about scans into my computer it did scan photos well at both and dpi but it was tough to get the images to scan in perfectly vertical at the higher resolution and higher color bit the scanning process took to long about seconds for a full page when scanning at dpi and bit color it took about seconds per page also the scanner actually turns off after each scan thus it takes seconds and button pushing to reboot the device before scanning another page importing images from the device to my laptop while it was still working took about minutes the ocr software paperport was good but the scan quality black and white and dpi was too poor to allow it to be functional the mb internal memory is not enough and the mb or mb expansion card is definitely needed what i was most shocking was the very poor craftsmanship there were seams on the device where the plastic was glued one of the two main buttons was recessed into the device also the indicator lights were misaligned with the overlying symbols i cannot emphasize enough how poorly made this was i am returning it for a full refund day money back and day exchange if bought from planon do not buy this product addendum april th i have had a very difficult time dealing with the planon company to return this product within the first days and get a full refund you must first get an authorization which required no fewer than phone calls and e mails once i finally had returned it they said they had credited my charge when they never did upon calling them they said it would take some time to see the credit come through that was weeks ago they do not return phone calls or e mails and in order to return this it has required alot of time and effort there business practices product quality customer service and return policy are poor at best i will re emphasize do not buy this product 
i threw half away it s a shame that garmin won t allow you to buy the individual components in case something gets lost i had to buy the whole mount just because i needed the rod connecting the base to the nuvi holder for the portable friction mount 
terrible product this tv only worked for three weeks then for no apparant reason it suddenly would not turn on i sent it back to coby for servicing and they sent it back still broken and with a new crack on it no one should by from coby 
maybe better with a sony adds volume but overall i would say the sound quality is very similar or not as good without this device i use it with my olympus ws m maybe it would work better with a sony it is also more prone to have interferance and it will make a loud noise when it picks up on something i don t use it just in case it makes that noise i don t want it to ruin my recording 
software is for windows only first let me say that fasttrack works perfectly for my needs i needed to get a mic signal through an xlr cable into my mac powerbook for demos absent of my usual protools software and clunky hardware the mac sees the fasttrack immediately but you should also know that none of the bundled software works with the laptop and considering this is an input box and software you and i are paying for if you re on a mac you should go elsewhere to buy the box alone instead of this package i saw new units at the amazon new and used link at the top of this page sans sessions software for a much lower price not exactly fair dealing from m audio as they flat out name garage band in their product description and then talk about how great the accompanying software is for that reason alone this package only gets stars from this mac protools user 
didn t work with my linksys wireless router i couldn t get this product to work with my existing equipment the netgear extender had a default ip address of linksys routers serve ip addresses in the x range i couldn t get beyond this incompatibility my search of the internet for a solution only found more people reporting the same problem i finally returned the netgear extender for an equivalent linksys product which i had no problem getting to work 
wireless feature is useless for this camera i installed this camera and worked fine i took it downstairs for wireless it is so slow you can take a nap if you trying to use to see video from work overseas or from another wireless computer forget about it it does not work even i enabled port on camera and opened the ports on wireless router it worked as long as it was sitting next to wireless router if you take if far from wireless router it does not work i returned it and using my logitech quickcam wired 
worthless the previous model the was an excellent pair of headphones that would only set you back about ten dollars sony replaced the with the the has the same good quality sound as the previous model but it is smaller even standing still the headphones slip off of my ears causing me to constantly adjust them i don t know if it is the smaller size or angle of the headset but the fact that it won t stay on my head makes it totally worthless i have many other kinds of headphones and have never run into this problem before so it is a faulty design not the shape of my head i would stay away from this model 
worked great for a couple of days i was so excited about how great this product worked when i got it i had purchased the fm transmitter for my wife and they do not work so great so i thought since my car had a tape deck i would give this a try i was excited that i had all my ipod music with me but after less than a week it the sound started going down hill to a point where i couldn t listen anymore with it it is now in a landfill somewhere my guess is i will need a radio in the car that is ipod compatiable cable for now just have the radio and cds i burn 
you can do better i bought this for my god daughter for christmas i actually thought that i was ordering a schoenhut baby grand but for some reason i ended up with this anyway it is not a piano it is a toy it doesn t sound like a piano it doesn t play like a piano it just looks like one and that is about it metal rods for the sound doesn t sound good at all you hit one key and get multiple notes with very little clarity and i have to pound on some of the keys to get it to work well or have a clear sound all in all i really wish i could return this item get my money back and spend the another dollars on a schoenhut or other good brand of childrens piano but the day i received it and checked to see if i could return it i could not i got ripped off by something else people this technically isn t even a string instrument and definatley won t really help in teaching a child music in my opinion 
remote woes it is to hard to set up with other tvs other then sony tv 
impossible to set up i spent two days tried to have it formatted by my powerbook g and set up a wireless network to replace my microsoft wireless router no luck it is on the shelf ever since people at the genius bar in local apple store may be able to help but it is too much troubel to set up other routers with a pc you can easily hire some one to set it up for you at your home for a couple of hundred dollars not apple if you don t have time don t buy this product 
weak power supply antec has dropped the ball on this one my power supply came in doa if you read reviews there are lots of reports of short life on power supply the case weighs pounds it is a major hastle to uninstall everything and mail it back to california it is a pretty case with some well thought out features but not worth reliability hastles 
looks great but beware wish i had bought this from amazon i paid more for it at staples this pack is cushiony great looking with lots of pockets but beware the zippers are very prone to breaking we ended up cutting through two of the zippers after they broke to get the objects inside this was after only months of use also the backpack is quite heavy i wouldn t buy this again at the steep price it is it definitely isn t worth the money 
less then what i had hoped for first let me say i am a big supporter of the zune and it s software i love it and wouldn t mind investing my money into a second generation early but these headphones suck sorry to say the sound was terrible i m a visual effects major and i m around various sound equipment on a weekly basis the quality is less then ideal the head phones that came with my zune far surpass these my major problems are below cons lack of sound quality can t get them to stay in my ear feel like i m probing my ear noise canceling feature definitively didn t work pricepros awesome carrying case magnet earphones work better then the original zune snap well 
encryption is not for macs yet not for windows domains i bought this because i wanted an encrypted device that i could use to offload personal documents i receive while traveling for work and then read them using my mac s at home lexar jd ii is the only product i found advertised to work with both macs and pcs at the same time my primary mac is an intel mac early on i realized the encryption utility only runs on ppc macs okay so i figured i d use it on the ppc mac mini and everything seeemed fine at first then i hit a problem where my mac mini could not read video dvds a little search on the mac support forums and i found that installing lexar jd software disables video dvd support on my mac ! fortunately there were instructions on how to uninstall aside from the problems with the macs i also hit the problem another reviewer mentioned which is that you must be logged in as a local administrator to use the encryption software under windows since my work pc is a member of a domain i had to create a local account log off the work domain and back on as a local user to use encryption anyway kingston data traveler elite works fine under windows domain logins unfortunately for me they don t have mac software yet so in summary the current lexar encryption software can t be used on a windows domain machine can t be used on an intel mac breaks the dvd on a ppc macit s not for me however if you are using the lexar strictly on stand alone windows pcs or you don t require encryption it should be okay 
terrible sound garbled and disappointing i design consumer audio professionally i bought the igroove for premium sound in my bedroom to listen to while my girl and i are getting it on this system sounds terrible with my ipod i tried a variety of different music the differen levels are all garbled there s no crispness at all no distinction the bass is fuzzy even at medium volume levels forget about high volume it sounds awful the remote is oversized and shaped oddly it s curved and doesn t sit flat i am going try and return it really not a high end stereo at all i m going to try something else 
buyer beware i ordered the colby cx cd portable cd player for my year old nephew along with a cd for his birthday when it arrived the am fm radio worked but the cd player did not this unit was obviously not tested prior to its release my nephew was so upset that he wasn t able to listen to the cd he has been asking for talk about a terrible birthday gift ! what a tease i would have been better off not buying anything at all than half a gift that was of no use to him in the meantime i m still waiting for amazon to send a label so i can return this piece of crap i will never buy anything branded colby in the future amazon unfortunately i m associating you with your affiliation to colby you would be better off dropping their products don t let them drag you down with them 
trash dont buy this one the wire dsl filter is much better i have the wire dsl filter and it is much better than this southwestern bell one the wire is much smaller and sleeker and does a perfect job filtering out the noise unlike the southwestern bell s 
not quite as advertised i have a dell laptop this inverter provides sufficient power to recharge the battery while i drive but it cuts out if i try to turn on the laptop to use it in the vehicle the information on amazon com doesn t make clear the limitations of this product 
too small the case is too small it just fits the laptop with no place for laptop accessories not even for laptop battery i wouldnt suggest this case 
reviews i read a year ago were great what happened i always read costomer reviews before buying anything i did just that with the pixma mp and was confident in my purchase months after purchase the thing cant print black now when revisiting the reviews there seems to be a comon complaint canon pixma mp wont print black keep in mind when buying an all in one printer that without black printing what good will it do wish i would have seen this complaint before maybe i did and thought it wont happen to me seems like its happening to over of these currently ish reviews 
an almost good product i have had this kensington fm transmitter for about months and in my hands it has very acceptable sound and not alot of static unfortunately it has one fatal design flaw that makes listening to classical jazz and any other type of music with any quiet passages very frustrating during the quiet parts the unit will shut itself off causing my car audio to emit a ear piercing screech when it loses the signal i haven t measured it but it seems like as little a seconds of quiet causes this behavior this makes this unit useless for classical music and quite a bit of jazz and other similar styles if you listen to quiet music avoid at all costs if you don t it is the best transmitter i have tried sirandar 
weightlifters beware i was pretty disappointed with the tune belt because of two main reasons first i had to take my shuffle out of the protective rubber case that i usually keep it in so that it would fit inside the tune belt that wasn t such a big deal since it is somewhat protected inside the neoprene sleeve but then i went to wear it for a run and the arm band was too small for my arm ! i have fairly developed biceps from years of weight training but nothing outrageous i would have thought that with a velcro strap there would have been enough range to accommodate most users this is unfortunately not the case so if you have larger than average biceps say amd up save your money 
definitely stay away bought this about two months ago never liked it for two reasons the rubber cap is so easy to lose guess that s why it comes with spares though utterly slow ! this is what was most uncomfortable with the drive yeah it s slow only with groups of small files like everyone else said still it s annoying to have to zip a bunch of small files everytime before you copy them over to the drive then unzip when you want to use copy them not practical and now well it just stopped working last week i mean completely for no reason just great like one day before i was going to sell it to someone else stay away from this one 
avoid memorex dvd media if using nec a use maxell or fuji disks they work flawlessly 
disappointed this product does not produce a clear sound the connection emits static and can be annoying to listen to we ordered two of these and they both have had the same results 
no improvement i replaced the antenna on my di router i am able to extend the antenna ft from the base but i don t see any signal improvement on my laptop or desktop that son wifi 
stopped working after one movie i was so happy with the first dvd i played then the second and every next dvd would not load the player has never left my kitchen table no chance for abuse i sure hope i can return it it was expensice 
poor picture quality it is almost impossible to get a clear picture on any channel and the sound quality is poor buying this handheld was a big mistake 
i really wanted to like these but i ll be returning the third set in a month first set headband broke two days in second microphone didn t exist as in literally removed that tiny cap on the tip of the extension and there was no little mic inside and the main volume control knob started going crackly where you have to pinch and squeeze and torque it to get all channels working third set microphone existed but the sound quality is wretched just utterly wretched and yep the volume control is now giving out just like the first two during the brief periods that it s actually functioned properly the sound was quite positional and fun for gaming of pleasantly acceptable but not audiophile sound quality not to be confused with product quality which this puppy comes up short on after even the third try 
gumy i do not know why they named these gumy headphones there is nothing gumy about them except the look they are large in size and as hard as a rock i bought them for my year old daughter and they are too big and uncomfortable i tried them in my ears and agree i recommend spending a little more money and getting something that is comfortable and it will sound better too 
not as good as you d expect from microsoft i have diabetic vision problems and thought the laser s capacity to magnify small areas of the screen would be useful for maps data sheets etc i ve decided to return it and get a larger monitor instead this mouse moves eccentricly and you move over the page or screen in fits and starts once you turn the magnifying function on it can be quite difficult to turn it back off in one case i had to reboot lastly it screws up some other functions like delete and highlight it s a great concept and i ll try subsequent versions when they come out but this one ain t ready for prime time 
useless piece of trash this mouse is designed horribly bad it opens fine when it is new but as soon as you put in the batteries it refuses to open i suspect that the designers of this mouse did not think about trying to open it when the batteries are in i would not recommend it to anyone unless you want a use and throw mouse i thought kensington was a good company did not expect this from them i will stay away from their products henceforth 
a waste of money i was given one of these as a gift i replaced it in my dolby digital dvd to amp signal path it sounds no better than the cheapo wal mart video coax cable i had been using for a couple of years then i thought isn t that the whole reason to go digital in the first place s and s don t know the difference between oxygen free copper and regular wire ! save your money 
i need more power scotty i bought these thinking they were a good deal but now i have to agree with some of the other reviewers i bought of these and one year later i have four left that will take any sort of charge the ones that died maybe had six recharges on them each i also have several high end chargers that don t want anything to do with the ones that died on the bright side i have several lenmar dlcrv batteries for my digital camera and they have been a after years 
did not fit product advertised this did not fit my second generation ipod as advertised and i did not get any response about returning it and of course i had to open the thing to find out it didn t fit 
when it worked the micro has some excellent features at the right price but it fails to work all the time first it was the firmware then it wouldn t connect to my pc now the hardware has failed i am going to buy an i pod despite apple s refusal to allow other forms of mp downloads 
tv ok service from amazon buyer beware buyer be ware if you have a problem with delivery or the tv you will be left on your own to sort it out amazon may or may not be a big trust worthy company but they will still leave it to you to sort out there is no personal customer service other then email run around bare that in mind before making any large purchase may be better to pay a little more through a company with a store front at least you will have someone to complain to face to face or take the item back 
poor range for me does not compare with motorola the range was poor interestingly when i pressed the call button that was transmitted but the recipient couldn t pick up my voice and vice versa if they work for you then you have a good deal but not for me 
too small i purchased this for my deskjet c so i would be able to transport my printer and have it padded and protected no way would it fit with the padding in place why bother with a case when a backpack will offer just as much protection for the printer maybe it shouldn t be recommended for this particular printer 
don t like it at all i think this is a very bad wireless mouse it didn t work wireless for me even though i charged the battery for more than hours according to the manual so i had to connect the recharging cable with it all the time that makes it a wired mouse the buttons on the receiver and mouse are so tiny that you have to use a pen or something to press it the battery cover is hard to open this mouse does not have a sensitive signal the motion of the cursor lags behind your mouse terrible mouse ! 
big hands beware also mac os x users i was hopeful about using this mouse for gaming and its response time did deliver it is more precise in it s cursor control than any other mouse i ve used however it was apparently designed for someone with smaller hands than me i find it s side buttons are difficult to use they re very small and their action is not to my liking further i was hoping that third party drivers would provide the ability to use all of the buttons when using mac os x tiger the steer mouse driver provided the best support and it supports everything except the right side buttons i ve found nothing that supports those buttons on the mac platform to date 
waste of money i truely wish i had found the prior reviews for this product before i bought it unfortunately i am now stuck with a product that will not start and will not run on my pc running winxp do not buy this product support sucks all around and there appears to be no fix now or in the near future to get software working i lost bucks on this one ! 
terrible piece of equipment after constant dropouts for the past months and no help from the belkin bozo ssupport i received a long delayed canned e mail answer to my problem which didn t help a bit i finally got rid of this piece of junk and installed a linksys network card both linksys hardware and software are a vast improvement no more dropouts i would suggest that prospective purchasers of belkin products hesitate before buying it s one thing to have a product that works intermittantly but it s really frustrating when product support is worthless 
bad labeling ad made it look like a charger that works in a car i am furious if i want to return there is a feewhat a joke 
major driver installation problems with se wasted hours trying unsuccessfully to install the driver for the iogear gicu port usb card on a dell optiplex gx running se this computer already has usb ports the main problem is that the add hardware wizard does not find a inf file in the iogear supplied cd folder and does not recognize the executable program that is in the cd folder user has to cancel out of the wizard and execute the driver installation file as a stand alone program this results in installation of drivers that show up in the device manager however the installation wizard comes up at every subsequent reboot and the user must cancel out of it just to get the computer going installed card seemed to work ok for a d link wireless adapter but did not recognize a digital camera that was satisfactorily recognized by one of the non iogear ports the following actions did not help swapping the card to another pci slot downloading and installing more recent driver file from iogear website three calls to customer support where i found sympathy but so solution 
unresolved difficulties this remote was easy to program but has not worked well for me it will suddenly turn on all the emitters which then blocks all commands for up to hours favorite buttons sometimes work other times do not work have tried to get help from universal but they ignore all my emails can t recommend this remote 
junk this product is aweful the gear strips the pad is staionary while the disk spins and this leads to circular scratches on the disk compared to the disk washer product that i had used for years this product is junk avoid it 
tremendous disappointment santa brought hello kitty this past christmas hello kitty is my daughter s favorite it was going to be the best gift ever instead it was her greatest disappointment the mikes music and lights were going to be amazing the one santa brought never worked so we contacted target and they sent a new one well that worked maybe a day we figured the drain on batteries was so great that it couldn t run for long so we bought an adapter which it didn t come with didn t help doesn t work so now i have broken hello kitty cd players and an adapter we spent including batteries and adapter for this 
stay away recent quality is terrible i ve previously purchased memorex media dvd r and have not had any problems until recently my latest purchase has given me infinitely more grief and frustration than the initial purchase price where do i start how about the fact that the media is labeled as x and only burns at x gray spindle how about the fact that files and videos have errors causing file corruption and or video dropouts stutter or dvd lock up i thought it was my recorder until i read all the reviews there has been a huge drop in quality recently if you want to gamble with the recent sub par quality of the memorex branded media and hope every thing turns out ok by all means make your purchase here for me i m dumping more than remaining on the spindle because the media is completely unreliable and worthless for anything other than coasters 
dont buy this junk i purchased my in september it s now january and it has never worked correctly at all it would say that i am in russia then lock up i live in nj usa the first time that i sent it it my expense magellan support sent it back to me within hours and it was not fixed it still said that i was in russia and would lock up the second time that i sent it to them they sent me a shipping label via email they had it in their paws for about weeks it came back said that i was in peru and then lock up i have an old lowrance and never had a problem receiving a signal it always locked on to my location albeit a little slow and it worked ive been trying to get a new shipping label for this piece of junck now for one month first they said that they sent it to me via email but they said that because i have anti spyware sw on my pc that my outlook is rejecting the label but i use web based email then they said that they will send a label to me via regular mail it s been two and a half weeks and i have not yet received that label they told me that they sent it out days before christmas and that i didn t receive the label because of the delays in mail due to christmas and new year s but it s now january who knows maybe i ll be lucky and receive the label before its clear to me that they have no intention of fixing this piece of junk it was a mistake to buy it don t you make the same mistake 
unreliable discs i burn about cds a week in live music trades i can tell you from experience that these discs do not last after a year or so they start to skip more and more and have all sorts of problems any scratches that they have only make it worse i recommend using sony fuji or tdk all the others are cheaply made in comparison and just don t stand the test of time so if you care about preserving your cds don t use these ones 
it doesn t work i bought this product to help cleaning the lense of my auto cd player i tried it for at least times but no luck wet clean the lense manually is the best way but that will include getting the player out from the dash board 
decent but not as advertised on amazon com pros solid construction good feel excellent sound quality works with power outcons keypad isn t backlit caller id isn t backlit contradicts advertising as of if on table then caller id visible only when looking down at phoneneutral caller id and programmable buttons of them dependent on aa batteriesi ve been on a quest for the perfect corded phone i wanted something with a cord so that there s at least one working phone in the event of a power outage and i wanted caller id since i enjoy knowing who i m going to be stuck talking to when i pick up the phone one of my requirements for caller id is that it have a backlit display so i wouldn t have to turn on the light in the middle of the night if i got a call i tried the at t trimline paired up with the ge caller id box but that didn t work well since the box wasn t backlit and it kept clicking on the line as if it were trying to flash it so you can imagine my delight after having read the specs on the at t corded phone according to the information on amazon com it had the trimline profile that i like a heavier weight to the handset so it doesn t feel flimsy and a backlit caller id unit built into the back of the handset plus it was inexpensive i bought one immediately when i unboxed it i was happy with the weight and design of the phone even though it doesn t have a backlit keypad like the trimline phones of old do like the at t that i was using a pity since that s a nice feature and one for which i would have been glad to pay more so anyway i hooked it up and tested it out the phone had a good feel to it comfortable to hold as well as cradle between ear and shoulder the quality of the sound was excellent both clear and without the tinny sound that can result from the audio compression in cordless phones i only had one complaint but it was a major one the caller id wasn t backlit moreover there was nothing in the instruction manual indicating that it was supposed to be either this was a big gripe since the real feature of this phone for me was the backlit caller id that amazon com advertises a possible problem for others considering the as a telephone would be the orientation of the caller id window as it s on the top of the handset you have to be looking down at the phone if you decide to rest it on a table or nightstand i e there is no accessory to clip on the back to give it an angled elevation nor due to the location and style of the rubber feet can an impromptu one be constructed this essentially means that if you rest the phone on a table then the caller id window is viewable only if you stand up lean over or pick up the entire phone along with the base and look at it of course if you don t care who s calling then you can pick up the phone and just take your chances to me however this defeats my main reason for caller id not having to talk to people i don t want to if you just use it as a phonebook of recent callers then this isn t a problem also if you wall mount the telephone then this isn t an issue at all i use this telephone in my bedroom but have it wall mounted next to the bed so i can see the caller id just fine in the light that is so in conclusion the at t is a corded phone with great sound quality and a good feel to it i wish that the keypad were backlit and i m quite unhappy that the caller id window isn t backlit this is a good corded phone that with a longer cord could be a great wall mounted kitchen phone i would not recommend it for a location where the lights may be out or the area could be dimly lit i am presently using it for a bedroom phone but if i find another corded phone in a trimline model that has a real backlit caller id then i will probably switch and move this phone to the kitchen or in a spare drawer for storage 
do not buy this product i have been on the phone and on the internet with linksys support suince i received this ite the install discs did not work the support personnel cannot help after an hour on the phone stumped you are cut off and have to start over e mails to linksys are ignored i am not computer illeterate but you have to have a systems degree to install this unit mine is still sitting here like a lump i will return it to amazon and ask for costs of shipping as this is a useless product 
it just doesn t work you have to move the dial really really slowly to pick up any stations plus the connection with the headphones doesn t work so most of the time if you can get a station you can t hear it anyway i m just going to throw it out and keep the headphones as an extra set 
case logic needs better designers fast i really need binders that can hold more discs as my collection grows and as so many new dvd releases are multiple disc sets so i was really hyped about the release of this new disc binder boy was i disappointed i bought mine at a local retailer but before purchasing it i noticed that the binder came with two types of sleeves each of the old disc design and each of the new disc design i thought the binder was tampered with so i started to inspect at least other binders and found the same allocation of sleeves in each of them so instead of potentially storing discs sleeves x dics sleeve i m left with only max at least it was accurately advertised as an disc binder but wouldn t it be better if it held but the bad thing is that the dimensions of the disc and the disc sleeves are different with the disc sleeve being between to shorter on a given side so if you have the types of sleeves interspersed in your binder you may easily miss some of your discs stored in the shorter sleeves when you flip through it i bought the binder anyways it wasn t until i started using the binder at home that i found really bad things about the new disc sleeves that just totally irritated me the openings for you to insert the discs are so minimally cut out that the only way you can take a disc out of the sleeve is to grab the disc with your fingers causing fingerprints and possibly even scratches on the surface to make matters worse the sleeves have notches in them that i am guessing were designed to hold the disc in place so that the disc doesn t fly out while you flip through the binder but these notches hold the disc so tightly that they make you have to grab the disc even harder to remove it from the sleeve the old sleeves though not perfect were designed much better because the cutouts were large enough for you to stick your forefinger into the disc s hole and slip the disc out by its edges my only option now is to hope the current case logic designers are replaced with more talented and creative ones soon because my dvd collection just got bigger with the new star wars release 
overpriced merchandise although i liked the bose cd unit i really felt that the sound was a slight step up from other music units if i am going to pay top dollar for a cd player it better give me than it does this unit would be better value for less it really isn t that spectacular for this money sorry to say i am such a music person and i thought that i would give it a try very little audio difference to make up for the overpriced ticket on this unit remote is small and cheap little better than a credit card in feel 
junk replaced first spindle and still junk will always stick with verbatim from now on 
has anyone else had this problem heres a new one i have recently bought two spindles of these discs and my computer imac w intel chip hardly outdated simply doesnt recognize them like i never put in a disc at all the kicker is that this spring i also ordered two spindles of these discs exactly the same as far as i can tell from which i burned one hundred discs not a single faulty one for a freind overseas i have no idea what the deal is but have a feeling that the issue is not the quality of the discs anyone got ideas 
no flash button on handset i bought the kx tg and an extra handset after being so pleased with it spredecessor kx tgthe handset does not have a flash button what you have to do instead is press the speakerphone button wait foroptions to appear on the screen and then press a different button toaccess the flash function and there is no way to figure that out whilelooking at the handset why 
waste of money i bought this cahrger and i was never able to use it i even bought the correct tip for my laptop but i can t get it to work i have no one to talk to at targus save your money stay away 
terrible sound don t understand how people can say good things about it this is a sincere comment on this product and my first one ever i bought it and i was excited to try it out in my bedroom the unit looks pretty nice and for the price it definitely felt like a good deal however the bass sound is absolutely terrible i did read about this in another review but i didn t expect that it would be this bad i actually checked the eq setting of my ipod to make sure it wasn t in a bass boosting mode or anything like that i was hoping that if i turned it off i d get an ok sound and i d not have to go through the trouble of returning it my advice don t buy this product its the only way we can tell these companies on the market just for the money that they cannot just have a good external fashion design and a good marketing campaign that they will fool us and make money 
monster cable is a rape i mean rip off if it s not already obvious monster cable is the carpetbagger of the home entertainment world with the rapid development of new hd and audio technology monster cable does their best to be the first to provide cables but not without charging a horrendously inflated premium in this case all you re getting for your bucks is an rca to converter and eight feet in between sony makes a great foot cable for less than four dollars and if the length is what you really need you can daisychain a couple of those together for still less than half of the price of monster cable s offering it is important to be aware than in the world of electronics and in fact everywhere someone will try to rip you off 
stay away terrible ! the cd rom didn t even have any data on it i am in the process of returing this junk for a refund 
burn in this product was purchased months after comparison shopping and on line reviews the picture was great until this weekend when i noticed vertical burn in lines whch approximate the boundaries of non hd broadcasts samsung s tecnical department blithely notes such burn in is common and that it is never covered by warranty the commercial hype by samsung about their built in system to prevent burn in is just designed to sell the product as the technician admitted it does not really help samsung should be honest and let prospective purchasers know the real of their sets which experience the problem my friends have panasonics which have never had the problem even after years usage 
beware of mail in rebate hoax the card works as advertised but sandisk does not send in mail inrebate even though i mailed it in with the upc barcode sandisk sent me a post card stating that i needed to resubmit it with the barcode how can i resubmit when they already have the barcode in my experience with sandisk i got rebate back on one of two cards that i submitted so you get mail in rebate of the time with sandisk i think mail inrebate is a big hoax perpetrated by these companies don t trust it ! 
they work but they are painful to wear they are decent headphones sound quality wise i have very complaints in that department however even after a few minutes they can become very painful to wear i suppose you get what you pay for but usually philips is better than this needless to say i plan on returning them also just a side note the current picture featured in this product listing is not what the headphones look like i m not sure what model those headphones are but the actual shp look nothing like that hopefully amazon will fix that soon edit amazon has updated this product listing now the picture now matches what the headphones actually look like 
too small for most computers i would not recommend this unit for most computers as the battery is too small to provide reasonable runtime under a w load it only lasted minutes while the back ups es lasted almost minutes the es is only slightly more expensive but provides much longer runtime in my opinion this ups is only good for very small loads less than the average computer 
be careful of what you think this is first of all i thought sat radio advertised commercial free radio was that it is not at all in fact i spend most of my time looking over the chanels for something not with commercials they claim they have nothing to do with that so this is a good buy if you want another radio player with commercials a lot of them and to pay for it i got this because i was tired of radio commercials and awful radio announcers who talked over songs and too much well sattelite radio is the same thing just with cussing so keep this in mind before you buy 
not as good as philips she i like bose products i also think they are a good company overall but these phones are simply mediocre in sonics put them on and they sound good enough but they are inefficient and give the impression of clarity via softness they do not compare to philips shes sonically the philips are incredible once you get the right sized ear bud on of course the same goes for the bose it is essential to find the bud for you or you ll never see the merits to in ear phones if you don t think that finding the right sized bud is important try carefully using in ears without any buds on and you ll get tinny nothingness you can tell the difference between these two makes by hooking them up via a large headphone adapter to a regular stereo system no comparison the philips are truly premium at c against the near you serve up for the bose again these phones are good at they d be a fair value even so at just under still they would not be as good as the philips shes at nearly the bose are overpriced and in my opinion you are paying for all the tv advertising they do if you have money to burn you can t go too wrong with the bose but you can do better two stars because they do work but since i now have five pairs of philips shes i doubt i will ever use the bose again they are not a value for that look to the philips shes 
if i could give it zero stars i would do not buy this laminator the first one i bought broke and the replacement broke the first time i used it waste of time and money 
harman kardon is so unreliable nowadays i ve had hk products since the s and generally like their products but this is the second hk cd that broke just after a few months of light use the first one after a couple of years cd should last longer than that i believe i want to stick with hk to have the same brand name in the house but unsure if i should throw good money after bad any more 
not usable due to sonicstage hardware awesome software a flop since you have to use their software the package is destroyed i will give you the final nail on the coffin for me i tried to put podcasts on the device using the latest sonicstage no chance it wants to be able to find each artist in the sony library this was bad for the odd bit of music it could not find but obviously it can not find the podcasts in their library i had bought one of these and had considered one for the girlfriend no chance now shame as the hardware was a 
poor usb performance buggy dvi switching while it appears i finally have this switch mostly working i have to say i m very dissapointed in it s performance iogear s usb emulation for keyboard and mouse works very very poorly with keyboard and mouse plugged into the correct keyboard mouse usb ports i would continually have a slow stuck keyboard along with really poor mouse behaviour i can work around this by plugging my keyboard mouse into the rear usb ports thus bypassing the keyboard emulation this works although you have to wait for all your usb devices to re enumerate every time you switch computers while my mac powerbook works fine with the dvi switch my pc quite often has problems recognizing the dvi monitor when switching back to it unplugging and reconnecting the lcd s dvi connector into the switch seems to bring it back to life no idea where the problem is but i have a dell fp monitor windows xp sp with ati radeon everything running latest drivers firmwarehow iogear could have shipped a product this broken is beyond me unless they release a firmware update that fixes these problems i can only recommend people stay well away from this product 
same problems as all of the above users my cd player has jammed in a similar fashion to those described above i called the harman kardon customer service line and they kept me on hold for ten minutes then i went to their website which is poorly designed and slow to load due to an overabundance of flash graphics the website told me to fax a warranty replacement form to harman i had to do that three times to get a response finally i got a return authorization after two days and several emails poor quality poor customer support guess what h k i won t be buying any of your products in the future this is a replacement for a sony changer that worked flawlessly for years and i may take hk to small claims court if the replacement doesn t work 
nice try one month after purchase one speaker power supply burnt out the support company recton is bankrupt thomsen has taken over support but you need to return everything just to get a power supply cheaper to buy a power supply at radio shack i d suggest taking your money elsewhere 
short and broken the retractable mechanism works well and the cable is compact but this cable is pretty much useless as a travel cat cable first of all it s too short in about half of the hotels where i needed to use it the network jack was at least a couple of feet further away than the reach of this cable second and more importantly it s not robust enough after a year or so of light use a wire inside got broken somehow and today i had to go in search of a regular cat cable on the outside there seems to be no damage to the wire in short it s one of those purchases that i regret enough to write a negative review 
bad design the irock s sound quality is on par for most of these fm transmitters they all sound bad i was aware of the sound limitations when i bought the irock my big issue is the design and placement of the power button it is set up in such a way if you put it in your glove box or just about anywhere you can guarantee something will press the power button and run down the batteries very frustrating the irock also limits you to only four station radio choices etc since i live in boston a fairly large city with many many colleges those frequency are being used so the irock is useless for me when i am downtown as soon as i get out of the city i m fine there has to be a better unit out there 
poor quality unlike many reviewers i had no real issue with the installation process i have installed many linksys products on my wireless network and a few minutes of reading on the linksys community forum revealed a good user install tutorial that worked just fine i was up and running in minutes the problem is that the quality of sound coming from the music bridge blows ! i had the unit sitting less than feet from my router and was experiencing a large number of drop outs not to mention the fact that the music sounded like it was coming from under water i know i have the most recent firmware etc many user forum comments indicate that one problem is network traffic hello if this product cannot work while my home network has other traffic then what good is it i am not even going to bother with further trouble shooting i wanted to give this unit a try because it was cheap and i have all linksys gear already i have been down this path with other linksys products and typically if their product does not work out of the box then no amount of tweaking will really solve the problem i am going to return this unit and go with one of the logitech wireless solutions which use a direct wireless connection not through your home network and have better reviews 
only trouble and big regret of wasting money after purchasing the item in december it didnt take even a week before the troubles started it kept freezing after switching it on and took quite long to rebuild the data at one point after two weeks i lost all my data despite downloading the software from the website the problems didnt disappear and i am basically left with a promising player which doesnt even allow me to listen to music without frezing since then i am struggling with creative technical support team as thereis advise given to charge my battery or download the software from the website which both is not been of much help this player hasnt been much of use to me yet and i deeply regret having paid usd i gave it stars because i was able to watch movies while waiting at the airport and travelling this was quite a pleasure 
ihome is a disappointment so when i first got the ihome for christmas i loved it well i loved it in spite of the glaring bright light that even at its lowest setting has to be blocked for me to get to sleep however after awhile the ihome will not register my ipods existence at all today i was able to enjoy thirty seconds of a song before it fell into disgrace again i would not recommend this product if you want something that lasts this device has become nothing more than a nuisance that won t even pick up radio stations so the alarm can only be set to a vaguely annoying beep when these functions are disabled useless 
disappointed i have this system for about weeks and today remote control stopped working 
p os i know that everyone else seems to love this so perhaps my complaint is more about apple in general my ipod mini pinkis a lemon the battery has never worked properly it takes longer to charge than to discharge and my current playing time per charge no changing settings not backlighting nothing but hitting play and waiting till the battery dies is about hours apple will gladly sell me a new battery but other than that tough it is apparently my fault thet they re selling shoddy products i m not saying don t buy it there aren t realistically any better choices out there than the ipod but buy it when you have a week to sit around and evaluate it and when they get around to opening a store near you as for me i think i m going to dig out my old discman 
not my favorite headphones i have to confess right now i m not an audoiaphobe or whatever it s called i just wanted relatively inexpensive headphones to plug into my hard drive so i can listen to music while i m at work and block out all the annoying noise around me i had the sony headphones which were similar to the jvc but i ran the ear bud over with my chair and crushed it so i thought i d get something similar but a little cheaper i wish i had bought the sony again these are ok but everytime i move my head i get static so unless i m sitting very still the sound quality is not that great of course when i am sitting still they re fine and get the job done but that pesky static every time i turn my head or move is very annoying i won t buy these again 
seems like a good idea but the dub cr seems like a good idea in card reader and two more net usb ports all in one nicely styled unit great for your laptop right okay as long as you have some place to plug it in it comes with and requires an external ac power adapter other card readers are happy to be powered by the usb port the first unit we bought managed to corrupt the file structure of a gb compactflash card rendering it unreadable in addition to being generally balky the computer would sometimes not mount the card reader drives tech support had us exchange it for another one the new one does not work very well either it can lock up windows explorer when you try to transfer files from a memory card and has difficulty ejecting the card a problem i have not had with other card readers sometimes it will not transfer the files at all i have tried the device on several windows xp computers with similar results maybe you will not experience these problems but i did and consider the device too unreliable to entrust with irreplaceable digital files 
eh waste of money the coolit usb beverage chiller is a great idea with not sogreat execution it only keeps the bottom part of the beverage cold and not so much that you would notice a difference the fan is loud all inall an unimpressive product i m sending mine back 
why pay for something i can get from my cable provider for a month i am surprised there are not more reviews on how ridiculous the prices are ! i really did enjoy the ease of tivo from pre hd days and wanted to go back from my comcast hd dvr i then saw the pricetag and unlike the other people i can not justify spending that much money for a dvr ! it is definitely not worth it for something i get for extra a month attached to my cable service yes i do love the tivo interface and searching but i will not pay that much for it it feels like business suicide for tivo to want to sell that product at a ridiculous price knock dollars off that retail price and i might change my mind 
defective design this item produced and marketed exclusively for the iaudio x is entirely useless the carrying case does not comply with the measurements of the device itself the only way to insert the device into the limited size and shape of this carrying case would be to cut the case wide open with scissors even if one could somehow manage to squeeze an iaudio into the tiny case the designers forgot to install an opening for the charger i returned mine immediately if you order this item you will be frustrated with a poorly designed ill fitting unacceptable piece of worthless junk 
paint wears off keys after months of use just like others have stated the paint comes off the keys after a few months of use you would think logitech would have made a better product 
cover advertised to go with mp i purhcased this items was advertised to go with the mp i had puchased and it was entirely too big for the item 
broke down in weeks product just quit working weeks after i got it sent it back to manufacturer garmin who said they would have it fixed on a priority and over nighted back to me that was almost two weeks ago and have not gotten it back yet still waiting 
waste of money i bought this cahrger and i was never able to use it i even bought the correct tip for my laptop but i can t get it to work i have no one to talk to at targus save your money stay away 
nice potential not all good though awesome product if it worked well i have a th generation ipod the gb ipod video when docked and playing a movie or scrolling through a title the radio makes funky noises out of the speakers that are really annoying i dislike that if i set the volume at and wish that when the alarm goes off in the morning it would stay at volume and not bump up to volume which is quite loud and dont wish to wake everyone else up in the house just gets bad feedback off of all ipod functions and all i got it for christmas and i dont even use it it sits on my desk with a piece of paper covering the extremely bright blue screen with my ipod in it charging i use my cell phone for my alarm in the morning andrew foxwel 
virgin s vm gb mp player is not worth it i purchased this item a a reputable retailer in new york ny bh photo you couldn t beat the price of plus tax for a gb mp player with fm tuner and speakers i had a problem with the set up i was not able to install the music management program to get my music onto the player the player did not come with any cd so i installed the software as instructed by virgin s customer support and as per the quick start manual i also updated the player with the latest firmware as per the instructions of customer support i still could not transfer my songs ive e mailed them twice within hours detailing my situation but all they wrote back was to do the same thing all over again as i explained abve they kept referring me to the web site but there is no link for the management software it only have the firmware updates and the player desktop update which does not contain the music management software the only thing that works is the fm tuner the player along with the speakers is a great deal for the money however given the fact that i cannot put my music on it doesn t make it worth it 
stay away bad design i purchased a white one of these for the holidays less than months later the connector for docking the ipod broke off from the circuit board unfixable really a bad design and very cheap wasted my money with this device in addition the clock radio features a gradual volume increase when the radio goes off at the set time not a bad idea except you can t turn off the feature and the volume starts loud and gets so loud so quickly that it will wake the entire house up the worse part is this is the only way for you to use the wake to radio ipod feature why you can t preset a constant volume when setting the wake time is clearly another bad design i would not recommend ! 
doesnt make sense to buy get a ps gig version it has this technology built right in plus u get the best gaming system on earth till oh yea and buy a good hdmi wire from here i got one for dallors and a inch flatscreen from walmart hdmi hdtv u know the full deal and its emerson so its not a no name brand i hope this review is helpful to yo 
sound is disappointing i bought this product to use in my small office knowing that with the size of the speakers the sound would not be suitable for loud playing or large areas with this in mind i have to say that i found the sound to be poor even with the bass turned up and the treble down it still sounded tinny and weak i did like the fact that it accommodated my older st generation ipod and had several attachments for the various versions of ipods i bought it because it did accept my older ipod and because of the price but i sent it back and bought the im which has great sound and accepts my old ipod for a price that is not that much more 
not sure if this thing does anything the first one i had was broken so amazon replaced it quick thanks ! anyhow it doesn t take a genius to figure out how to plug it in but they could have given some instructions what does the little knob do anything i can t tell any difference how should i point the antenna for best reception people and objects moving about the house can affect the reception channels come an go sometimes for no reason i can get the same quality picture just by hooking up a long coax 
broke after year overall the recorder worked ok a moderate inconvenience was that once in a while the recorded dvds could not be finalized for unexplained reasons however that is irrelevant now a few weeks ago the unit stop working i does not turn on at all what a waist ! it is out of warranty now 
stopped working after an year bought this from amazon worked well for compact flash cards always complained that i should format the card whenever i used multimedia card from kodak camera so i was never able to use it to transfer pictures from a kodak camera and all of a sudden it died on me had to throw it out 
flawed hardware simple to use sounds good but the input wire for the sound breaks only after a couple weeks use in the car i sent the first one back only to have the replacement do the same thing you need to use the lighter power supply ans the use of the internal batteries does not do it i eventually re soldered the wires myself 
totally unusable after installing this software successfully when i try to run the application it displays a popup stating it cannot find the cd the cd is required to run the application even though the cd is in the drive ! so far i have been totally unable to run this software what a piece of junk 
befvp v no longer updated by linksys the latest firmware version available from linksys for befvp v is dated don t waste your money and be sure to buy the more recent befvp v latest firmware available dated jan note that v of the router only supports ipsec sessions 
did not function as expected the maxtor onetouch iii mini edition did not function as expected it doesn t backup system files neither the windows folder nor make an image of the notebook s hard drive maxtor wasn t very specific about all it can really do in their webpage the software which comes with it is really poor and offers almost the same that i can already do in windows with or batch commands and schedule i do not recommend 
starry eyed over this one but lets me down upon the joyful news that we were having a girl my husband decided to invest in a new digital camera and a photo printer the digital camera still works great the printer is another matter while this one prints beautiful pictures the cost of ink far outweighs the beauty of them sometimes as we all know this is how printer companies make their money through the ink replacing every cartridge at once will run you about at a time give or take a few the gray ink is used up the quickest and has also been one of the hardest for us to find here locally the main problem i have with this printer is that the quality is excellent after you replace the ink but for only about the first pictures after that the pictures take on too much of a magenta cast and start to get out of register very frustrating when you re printing out any pictures let alone ones of your child yes we do what the manual sugests for such occasions and the main one is to clean the printer cartridge heads but this has only actually worked for us on one occassion every other time get us no results and we are still stuck with pictures that resemble something a third grader took a crayon to in the long run i will not be buying a photo printer for home use but will rather take them to a store for processing qualitywise it gets you in the beginning but doesn t hold out for the long run we have fiddled with it for two years enough s enough 
great when it works i got this for christmas in i treated it with kid gloves didn t use it everyday and was careful not to drop it and always unplugged it by gripping the plug and not the cable it worked perfectly until a couple of months after the warranty expired feb then one morning it simply failed i had copied a file to it to bring to work and when i went to transfer it to my work computer the next morning it did nothing i tried it in four other computers with the same result since the warranty was expired and seagate won t repair it unless you have a service contract on it see their website i took it apart to see what i could do there is a microdrive that s easily removed i put it in my compact flash microdrive reader and still it won t work if you use one of these don t keep important data on it that isn t stored elsewhere which is always a good idea in theory this should have outlasted flash drives but i have three flash drives that have lasted longer than this with more use and abuse i wouldn t recommend this 
not one of sony s most user friendly products i bought this just to use as a cd player at the gym sound is fine but display is only adequate and controls are very small i always need to wear my glasses to change any settings would not buy again 
piece of garbage the little box with a few lights arrived in good condition and on time which was the good bit i fitted it in my car even though the lead is highly sprung and a bit short so it kept pulling out of the cigarette lighter hole especially when i went over bumps in the road after pulling the lead tight and wrping it around the glove box door i managed to get enough slack on the wire to stop it pulling out and all was well this weekend i went on a long journey and passed many stationary radars at the first one the little box didnt give a peep but i still had hope as the radar might have been turned off passed another and another and still nothing i got my wife to drive and tried removing the box from the mount and pointing it directly at the next radar incase my mounting was not right still nothing i tried using it in city mode because the piece of paper they laughingly refer to as instructions does not explain the difference between city and highway mode and still got nothing whatsoever i reread the box and the instructions to see if i was missing something but only found out how to stick the mount to the dash board and turn the thing on i did notice that it said the box detects all types of radar gun which could mean it only detects gun type radars and not the static boxes so i am waiting to see one of the mobile radars to test this but i m not too hopefull i will continue this review when i have tested this out but for static radars it is completely worthless which is why i refer to it as a box with little lights on it rather than a radar detector tb 
no support let s be honest this product ain t cheap it s not something you can just throw away if it decides to stop working i bought mine at cpenusa com delivery was great only took them a couple of days however my c pen cable was damaged the connector to the c pen was for some reason cut in half without it you can t recharge or connect the c pen to the pc i called their main office all the way in sweden during the office hours no response i sent three e mails to cpenusa no response i don t care if the product itself is great ill never know now will i if you re unable to receive support when you need em you re screwed if you re just interested in electronic equipments just want to try things out and don t really care if you re on your own go ahead and try it let me know how this thing really is otherwise buy a product that you can trust on with respect to after sales support 
looks good but very wobbly this stand looks okay but it is very unstable when i put my monitor on it it took seconds to stop wobbling very unsturdy 
outrageous price for sb the average going price for this product is the price quoted herein of is so far beyond what might be considerable reasonable it s ludicrous doesn t amazon have any standards for their third party vendors whether or not you disclaim responsibility for third party suppliers they do appear on amazon s web site and nothing will prevent amazon from being associated with such chicanery allowing such postings is unworthy of amazon for a number of years i have held an equity position in amazon and fully understand and generally approve of using additional sources for products your customers want and i do understand the meaning of caveat emptor but this is an embarrassment 
big waste of money i was so excited to get nav dvd in our new suv however i hate this unit ! you can t watch dvds unless the car is in park the whole point was for me to watch movies in the passenger seat while my husband drove also you have to put in a navigation cd everytime you want to look for a new address this means you have to remove your dvd or music cd and put in this special disc you then have to be in park to put your dvd back in and start it again we have screens on the headrests the worst part is you can t use any features of the nav system while you are driving ! i have to pull over to enter an address or find a point of interest while my husband drove i figured i d be able to use these functions it is not user friendly we have read the manual and still cannot accomplish tasks such as programming the radio stations i regret this purchase immensely i do not recommend this system to anyone unless you are willing to put the car in park ever time you want to use any of its functions 
do not buy of these i bought for to race but only one rumbles i have called logitech tech support and they said ohwellthats the way it was designed nowhere on the box or the instructions does it say that and it is very illogical i will not buy logitech gaming products again 
old technology i bought this radio to use while i workout the radio has a cicular dial not digital to change the station while you move the station slips and will change on you you need to hold the radio with your hand to listen definitly not a good radio for excercising 
service plan i have yet to receive anything to indicate that i have purchased a year service plan i am still awaiting this information i should have been sent w my product or before my product has arrived i am not satisfied because i have not received anything at all about my service plan when you send me something i will be happyms budho 
useless as far as i can tell this thing doesn t work at all i have now tried it on cds and it did not repair any of them i should have just replaced the cds 
better players are out there as a heavy gym user who has sweated several mp and headphones into the trash i thought this was the answer but after using it for several weeks i hate the thing my biggest gripes the sonic stage program seems not to be able to find and import the vast majority of wma format files that i have never had a problem using on my other players the program seems like a shill to force you to use sony s connect store cheaper mp players allow you to drag and drop files direct to the player i don t want another program just for this device the entire industrial design of the player depends on one small keyway on the back of the plastic case which in my case was deformed after one week and would no longer hold the player in one position without the keyway you have a round player that is free to spin in the round holder which make this impossible to use without tying up both hands even when the keyway was working the controls are not easy to use when you are working out the armband positions the player so that the rear of the twist knob digs into your arm and makes it hard to navigate the controls with one hand while running it is almost like no one actually tried to use this while running in the design phase this is a case of a cool looking industrial design that does not serve the market it was meant for avoid this player ! 
poor battery life after using these radios two months i can say that battery life is poor a full charge doesn t hold three hours perhaps my batteries didn t come in good condition i didn t use them on aaa yet mile range is not true in a normal environment open sea or desert perhaps product works fine while battery las 
great idea bad product big disappointment the product does not work in my view i have to review every card and have to manually correct the extracted information in of the cases it is not much different than entering the information manually the character recognition software has a long way to go to be effective does not even recognize that wireless is the mobile phone number one would think that they would get it right after all these versions and years the only good thing is once you scan the cards you can throw them away but still have to spend the same amount time entering the information by hand 
not that great what can i write that hasn t already been eloquently and accurately written here already the idea was a good one but the execution is poor i bought this for my explorist hoping that these reviews were a little exaggerated not so much the may review by netzotic tech head salisbury md usa sums it up quite accurately 
this is not a photo printer the black andwhite printing is ok but the photo printing is terrible this printer simply cannot print black in photo mode i used the canon photo paper plus glossy one of canon s premium photo papers the blacks look gray the colors are dull it reminds me of a newspaper photo the review on cnet is misleading it says that the colors were a bit washed out but they were impressed nevertheless the only thing that can impress me is how much the colors are washed out i own quite a bit of canon photo equipment and i cannot believe that canon can make such a terrible product the printer came free with a laptop that i bought and i did not have high expectations for it of course but i did not expect it to be that bad for photos i have seen photos from printers that are brilliant compared to this one canon should have advertised this as an office printer with color capabilities the photo lab quality sign on the box is a big lie after a few tests i put the printer back in the box and i will give it away 
do not buy this item my company l communications purchsed fvs s through amazon to provide a vpn firewall to connect two locations via the open internet using a bench setup with the fvs s connected through a hub the vpn firewall shut down after about minutes requiring me to power cycle both s to restart a web search showed that others have encountered this and related problems the netgear web site suggests a command line procedure to change the timeout values i did as suggested it had no effect i really would like to give it zero stars 
extremely poor quality this card when it worked at all was a hit ormiss proposition many times i would have to repair the connection switch preamble modes or restart the computer to get it to see either the belkin wireless router or the linksys wireless router this was even when the router was no more than away second it was impossible to get the card to work with my toshiba laptop after downloading three versions of the driver there are one finally worked but was unable to pick up the school network which is nice strong if the card is removed from or falls out of its usb slot it is not uncommon for windows to forget about the card and ask you to reinstall the driver upon putting it back in i finally smashed the card against the wall it works as well now as it did then if i could give this thing zero stars i would 
interlink remotepoint is poorly designed i ve owned three of interlink s units but that was before competitors came to market with well designed units the interlink pointer plastic casing is flimsy and cracks easily there is no off switch to prevent the laser from accidentally coming on when the unit is packed or placed in one s pocket the advance and go back buttons function most of the time but on average miss and have to be pushed a second or third time at least times per minute presentation although i agree with many of the points made by other reviewers who score this interlink product better than i do it seems these other reviewers have not compared the interlink pointer with competing pointers that have identical features for example the kensington pointer is half the price the case is sturdy has a no slip outer coating has a comfortable feel in the hand and even includes a trench that serves as a holder for the receiver when not in use placing the receiver in this trench automatically disconnects the laser so that batteries do not have to be removed when packing the unit for a trip and the advance and go back buttons function all of the time not just most of the time ! 
high expectations from netgear brand not a great product i am not going to write what this phone does and what it doesn t you will read it from other reviews i will explain what problems i had and you might have with it at least it might help you to troubleshoot the similar issues first it was easy to setup the phone connect it to the router and phone line register your skype name and make your first land line call quality is good then i placed a skype call to a friend and first problem no audio nobody hears anything i tried to use another skype account on my computer to make calls to from sphd and no audio i looked at all settings on the device support website and found nothing i tried to connect to the admin webpage using provided on the cd documentation username and password admin and admin and couldn t connect second problem well i reset a base unit and still couldn t connect to the admin page i searched online and god bless internet found that documentation on cd is old and current username password is admin password and what even better reseting a base unit have helped with audio problems ! hooray ! now i can make good quality skype calls without need to go downstairs to my computer the next and biggest problem i ve experienced is no matter that automatic sign in option is turned on the phone and the web page is asking the password every time you sign off sign in the skype turning phone off reseting base phone using different skype id etc did not help i called support waited minutes and was told i need to register the product online first well it has sense i did so and called again minutes later customer representative from deli was ready to provide me with an excellent service first he said yes automatic sign in should work and my phone is not defective and asked me to do all steps i did already i e reseting etc no luck then he left to check about this issue and called me back to state that phone must ask for a password every time i sign in for a security reason ! what about remember username password option there nice lie to a customer to make him believe problem is solved note if you turn the phone off yes there is an option to turn it off please press and hold red button without signing off then when you turn the phone on it wouldn t ask you for a password right but all this time that phone is off friends see your status as online away and may try to call you well there is a solution i ve found for myself never sign off just change your status to offline i have not decided yet whether to return replace the unit or keep it maybe when you learn tricks on how to use a device it would serve you well but at current price quality i would not recommend it too bad there is not many alternatives good luck with it 
don t buy this bought two of these phones the answering machine base unit and one expandable unit they actually sound great when they work about a month following use of the extra phone it wouldn t hold a battery charge any longer amazon pointed me back to panasonic or the panasonic black hole i dropped another or bucks on a new battery same thing no charge i would suggest it was defective hardware and not battery related i swapped the other phone s battery with it same thing so phone number one lasted about weeks phone number lasted about months same thing occured to phone wont hold a charge tried all three batteries with the remaining unit doesnt work draw your own conclusions i don t have time for a phone that doesn t work i bought it because ghz was interfering with the wireless network ghz is definitely the way to go and i suspect most the good reviews of this product can be attributed to adopting the frequency get that feature in another phone i m off to the store to try another brand and keep my fingers crossed 
don t buy them i have gone through pairs in months because they keep breaking one thing after another either one ear stops or they both stop in the same hour i wouldn t dare unless you can return them easy 
garmin rino series dc power adapter item is advertised as working with all rino series but it does not work with the rino 
the ability to pause during recording am i missing something or does this unit not allow you to pause during a recording when i try to use the pause button during recording using dvd r to record a program a message pops up saying that function prohibited during record mode and when i check the user manual the only thing it says regarding the pause button on the remote is that it is used to pause during playback a recorder with no pause feature for editing on the fly what if you want to edit commercials while recording what if you re dubbing from home videos and you want to pause to edit out unwanted segments seems to me that s either really bad design or a rather remarkable oversight 
locks up no support buy something else we bought a magellan t and it started locking up right away we had to reset every day loosing all info called magellan after days they won t send me a new one or return money it locked up times on the way to florida and when it was working the touch screen would stop working tried to take me down countless oneway streets in tampa the worst electronic product and support of any product company i have ever experienced wish i had bought a garmin i have two garmin products on my boat and they have preformed flawlessly for years

intermittently working i just purchased a set of two channel westinghouse intercoms and they worked only intermittently if i tipped one of the units it worked sometimes as though it had a bad connection i am trying to return them now to the seller good luck if you purchase a set of these they seem to be hit or miss as to whether you get a good set 
it is not really a mp player after buying this for almost one i decide to write a review for this machine first this is not a true mp player i was convinced to buy this from amazon com mainly by the long battery life promised by sony and high capacity of the gb hi md this turned out to be true after i tried the machine however the use of this machine is a painful process i have quite some collection of mp and wma music albums and some mp audio books at first i thought i can just plug in this machince into my computer and transfer the files i need and listen to the things i desire in the end i found all of the mp or wma files must be first converted into sony s special format omg with the provided hassel software then you can transfer and listen them the conversion takes so much time although the transfer of the converted files are pretty quick in the end i have to quit the using of this and replace it with a creative muvo tx fm gb mp player this is not a true mp player sonys thought are very different from other mainstream mp companies ! 
another example of sony s failure to keep in touch with consumers the bean is small battery efficient and has a nice overall look to it thats probably the only few good things that can be said about this product this is not an mp player it is a trac player you have to convert all your mp s into trac format before the player is able to play them you also have to install their software which for most of us is an intrusive program trying to list every music file on your hd this can ussually result in other people knowing what music you own especially if the software regularly communicates online another horror youll deal with is the slow transfer speed this device has just to load a single meg file took an avg of seconds imagine how long meg files would take if your looking for an mp player that lets you just drag and drop your fav mps into the device so you can hear them hassel free this in not the player for you this device is the stalin of mp player requiring strict uncomfortable conformity play your fav songs 
cheap price reflects quality poor sound quality no features not that easy to use don t waste your mone 
if you see a price on amazon the list price is wrong the msrp from the casio site directly is at that price i m sure its a great calculator but if amazon is trying to sell at i would go for the fx es instead better value for money 
not ready for prime time primitive menu systemchoppy output at hdwireless not quite fast enoughno pause button if you stop the video you get to start at the beginning again media center software is at revision aits a good idea come back in months 
good printer when it works first the print quality is very good when it does work it seems to work very well i was pleased with the print quality and features and the print speed is excellent but the real problem is the extremely unstable software more than half the time i could not start a scanning operation without it failing and when it fails it really fails and the only way to get it back working again is to pull the plug on the printer thats right the power button won t turn off the printer power when this happens and restart the computer which was the target of the scan output since i normally do a fair amount of scanning this meant most days having to reboot both printer and computer just to do a simple scanning job the printing software was also iffy although not nearly the problem as was the scanner software probably of the time a print job would not complete the hp image software which came with the printer was a very useful and straight forward photo processing tool which i would recommend for the most part hp chose however to ignore all the normal windows software conventions like having a file and edit menu at the top of the screen so you are always having to hunt around on screen for what you want to do bottom line i hate playing the printscan lottery wondering whether my print or scan job will actually work each time i try to print or scan something this is not a finished product and i strongly recommend buying something else 
won t do slides unless you re willing to unmount them just a heads up for people looking to use this scanner to scan slides you will have to unmount the slides in order to be able to scan them given the verbiage on the box it caught me as enough of a surprise that i returned the scanner i m not ok with deception like that 
non existent customer service i am having some problems with my receiver and from what i ve found you can t contact a live customer support rep if your life depends on it i ve sat on hold for hours trying to get someone complete joke 
range is poor even with direct line of sight it s range is poor even with direct line of sight 
uncomfortable light on bass ok the only headphones that i can compare this to is the sennheiser hd which i paid for in my dog chewed the line and i had to buy another set so i decided to go with the zalman surround sound based on reviews i read starting when doom was released in sad to say these headphones don t have anything on the sennheiser hd the zalman headphones are very uncomfortable becuase they sequeeze my ears too tightly my ears star hurting after minutes whereas with the sennheiser hd i could wear the and gain only comfort i m used to heavy intense bass from the sennheiser headphones where i can crank up the volume and be blown away with the zalman headhones i find myself lowering the volume because everything is so high pitchedthe surround sound aspect are almost completely identical between the two imo also the left ear muff was detached when i opened the box putting it back on has been unsuccessful i m supposed to be able to just twist it on but even though nothing is broken it wont fit back in place im disappointed with these headphones i only bought them because of the reviews here i guess most people haven t heard what it s like to listen to games and movies through qality headphones alas i guess i can only blame myself for this purchase my advice for anyone looking for genuine quality skip these and go elsewhere 
did not work did not work right out of the box followed the directions to reset and it still did not work button on side is too small i returned it to amazon 
not very happy with this product i am not a tech person but i am also not completely useless i have three cards i use for my palm pilot and two digital cameras i have been very unhappy with this product the other two cards are not pny this card seems to work fine in the camera and palm pilot but will not work when i plug it into the sd slot in either of our laptops it just locks up the computers for a while then asks if the card should be formated clicking yes or no does not help i get a message that it cannot be formated i am sure it is the card since the same thing happens on different computers like another reviewer i unfortunately threw the packaging away because it appeared to work in the camera i even tried to have the camera format it it just can t be read by the computers none of the other cards have this problem i can t return it and it certainly isn t working properly i would recommend buying a different brand 
returned without opening the box returned to amazon without opening the box because i ended up purchasing a sony home theatre system that included an upconverting dvd player as part of the package i will say i was concerned about the number of negative reports i read concerning the samsung hd dvd player after i had ordered it in comparison to the sony equivalent dvd player 
bimbo electronics about the only thing bose has going for it is pretty packaging the sound build and electronic quality is mediocre at best given its outrageous price point my sister refused my advice and bought this system then i bought her a cheapo jbl powered sub and cheapo jbl satellites which cost about the same and she was stunned ! i just felt bad for best buy they had to absorb the loss 
network connection defective this printer works fine as a usb printer but it does not connect to a network hp will not replace says it must be something wrong with my network nevermind the other printers macs and winxp computers connected to it no more hp for me 
disappointing i read something close to a rave review in walt mossberg s technology column in the wall street journal checked the reviews on amazon and concluded that it was a good bet to provide extended coverage for my house it might have been a good bet beforehand but one can lose a good bet and i did setup was virtually instantaneous and the two xes started talking to each other and the roving laptop i was using to test achieved a good internet connection about mbps through its direct ethernet cable connection to the its xe that was while we were in the same room then things went downhill quickly many of the other outlets in my house barely got a connection with the netgear utility showing as low as mbps ! like another reviewer i think netgear overestimates true throughput i think actual throughput was much lower than reported given the time to transfer a file from my laptop to my desktop after testing a number of outlets i concluded that this product is not the answer for me the reviews have been very good why did i get such a bad result i concluded it had a lot to do with my house wiring outlets that were close to each other and on the same breaker box seemed to perform acceptably but not better than wireless g outlets that were further away and or were on the second breaker box in my house did far worse my advice to anyone buying this is to make sure you can return it without penalty if it doesn t work out if your wiring is old and especially if you have more than one breaker box be wary of the possibility that it won t work for you i suspect the netgear xe will work satisfactorily for far more customers than it it will disappoint but regrettably i m in the latter group 
good tv for the price moronic remote i purchased my ldg like other reviewers to replace my old kitchen tv i really wanted an lcd with a built in dvd player while i like the tv just fine the remote is another story i actually wrote to the manufacturer about the remote and gave them quite an earful included in my e mail was the following while i find the overall tv to be good i am appalled at thequality and functionality of the remote that operates and comes withthat particular model i simply can t believe that a name brand likesylvania would provide such a poorly designed remote to accompany ahigher end tv this remote is very uncomfortableto hold and operate it is as if your designers made no accommodationsfor how people hold remotes and what makes them comfortable seriously i cantt imagine who designed the actual size and shape of that remote or which idiot approved it s public distribution but the entire lot of them need to find other professions if they think that this remote is at all acceptable a remote should be at the very least functional and comfortable enough to go unnoticed dont you think aside from the horrid shape size and weight of the remote this remote has an absolutely terrible layout and lacks some of the most basic buttons that come with the cheapest of remotes i was shocked and horrified to realize that this hideous remote had no last channel button are your designers living in the s or do they just have their heads up their butts i havent had a tv remote in my hand without a last channel button in at least years since the remote is so huge how could it not have one of the most traditional buttons on it i consider the very lowest and feature less remotes to be those in hotel rooms they look like top oftheline models when compared to this piece of crap on top of not having the basic buttons and amongst other issues the remote is frustrating because the text is illegible the buttons are laid out in a way that doesnt make sense and when you channel surf the remote is so slow to change the channel that you want to throw it on the floor and stomp on it in fact if i can find a universal remote that works with this tv i intend to do just that of course to add insult to injury it states clearly in your owners manual that we do not recommend the use ofuniversal remote controls not all of the functions may be controlledwith a universal remote control great so you provide a bottom of thebarrel remote with your tv but then dont allow your customers to get adecent remote by making your tv uncooperative with them this is thefirst time that i have encountered this too btw finallyi hope that you promptly change the remote that comes with the ldg lcd tv dvd combo tv i expect that you will experience many returns of this product due to the crappy remote that comes with it this was their entire response thank you for taking the time to express your concerns regarding our product your comments and opinions are important to us please understand that it is our objective to provide the best possible product we hope you accept our apologies for the inconvenience you have experienced with our product i am on the verge of taking this back because of the remote 
disappointing i put this cover on immediately after i opened my ipod after reading how easy they are to scratch i ve never had my ipod without the cover on it and have had it weeks i now have an ipod covered with distracting scratches on the screen save your money this case is junk 
no tape monitor feature it has been years since i last shopped for a stereo receiver and back then there were certain features that all receivers came with regardless of how basic or inexpensive the model was well i took for granted that they all still came with these basic features and i was wrong i just purchased the sherwood rx and it does not have the tape monitoring feature it has tape input and output jacks but it doesn t have the monitoring feature that lets you listen to the tape deck s output while you are recording if you press the tape button the receiver switches away from the input source you are trying to record from ! the tape monitor function is also necessary for the use of an equalizer it baffles me that they are still giving you tape in and out jacks but don t give you the proper switching for monitoring i guess they figured they could save a few pennies by leaving out this function since the demand for tape decks has declined in recent years unfortunately there are those of us who still like to use an eq to customize the sound to our environment even if we are no longer recording on tape i have found it difficult to verify whether or not a receiver has this function since the specs and features list usually never mentions it if they have a good picture of the unit you can look to see if there is a button that says tape monitor just looking for tape in and out jacks will not help because as i mentioned above the rx has these jacks but no monitor function then there are some models that have monitoring even though the switch only says tape the best way to know for sure is to try out the unit first but this is not practical when shopping online i have even gone so far as to go to the manufacturer s website and download the instruction manual if the section on tape connections and recording doesn t mention monitoring it probably doesn t have it also many models no longer have phono input but this is easy to check just by looking at a good picture of the unit the rx also lacks an auxillary ac jack on the back of the unit not a big deal but a consideration if you have an outlet strip already filled up by other components another thing i noted that is worth mentioning is that many newer models such as this one have volume control knobs that do not have any position indicators or scale markings on them so be sure to turn down the volume before you turn off the unit or you could be in for a surprise when you turn it back on again if you don t intend to use an eq and don t need phono input the rx is probably a good inexpensive starter model the sound seemed fine and it had plenty of power for my application the tuner did seem to have a weak sensitivity some local fm stations came in with a lot of static in my research i have found the teac models rv s and ag as well as onkyo models tx and tx all have tape monitoring capabilities as well as phono input 
never again four months ago i used this product and had no problems except the finished cds did not play in one person s car player with this stack every one of the first cds i made did not play in most equipment although they played in the recorder where i copied them it was very disconcerting to put them in other players and get nothing or get something only after forwarding to the rd track didn t understand why this was happening but i ll not buy them again it was a waste of many hours since i was assuming they worked 
not worth the hassle after receiving the item i installed it in my explorer and gave it a test run while out christmas shopping the picture quality on the main unit was outstanding however the other monitor had distortion and what looked to be signal problems i returned the item and received another from amazon kudos to amazon for being so fast with the replacement i installed the second item and had the same problems needless to say we returned that one too and went with a different dvd player 
big on hype small on performance i bought the version of this cable with the audio pair for an outrageous at circuit city out of dire necessity i have never liked monster cable because they use physics mumbo jumbo and deceit to market some seriously overpriced cables to unthinking consumers i opened the package at home to find that the color coding on the cables was incorrect and that trial and error would be the only way to get the right connection at their usurious price point i find this type of defect absolutely unacceptable and furthermore i would note that the cable construction was unimpressive using a cheapish vinyl jacket on the terminations thanks to circuit city s return policies i was able to return this junk and get my money back caveat emptor cable buyers spend your money wisely and stop the monster cable insanity 
don t buy from philips this system is quite sleek easy to fit in a cluttered living room assembly takes about two minutes the instructions are very clear the sound is amazing especially when you put on your favorite loud bass heavy film why then do i give it one star it skips like nobody s business at first my wife and i thought it was the disks we were putting in as many of them were scratched but then we put in new disks no difference when exactly does it skip impossible to tell sometimes a little sometimes every frame ! sometimes it ll tell us that disks are bad then the next time we put them in they magically work until they skip so i called philips and they said that not only would we have to pay for shipping but they could not guarantee that they would fix it and it would take up to a month before they d ship it back save your money ! buy from someone else 
scratched my macbook as long as its on it will prevent scratches but its tough to get off and that act can scratch your laptop it scratched my macbook when i pried it off the guy at the apple store who snapped it on a macbook beause i requested a demo couldn t pry it off and after embarassing minutes he called a colleague over and they pried it off together and to be honest this makes the mb look ugly kinda like putting a veil on a supermodel 
sucks the player was alright for a while but after like a month the display stopped showing any text and then it stopped linking up to my computer properly and when you call customer service at sandisk they are of little to no help overall i would not advise this ite 
no sound you only have three choices of stations to use for transmission two of which were already occupied the third station should have worked but we were only able to get sound by turing the volume all the way up and even then it was quiet and poor quality the only good thing was that amazon was good about the return 
hub not recognized my dell laptop d running windows xp didn t recognize the device when i plugged it into either usb port i contacted targus support and they stated that it should have worked and that i should try it on another pc if it doesn t work on this laptop i have no use for it there is no cd rom for support drivers and targus support stated that i shouldn t need any drivers went to microsoft website for compatibility and the device wasn t listed i should have researched this before the purchase i would not recommend anyone purchasing it 
ok if they survive the shipment the majority of my cases were damaged in shipping i immediately threw away about eight but as i tried to use the rest i gradually found ten or so more that had sustained damage as well maybe i m alone given the other high ratings but these seem more fragile than other slim cases i ve used in the past i d give them stars because they re cheap if they didn t have to be shipped 
mislabeled this site says the product is the actual packaging says it s but when i placed my notebook inside there was a ton of extra room it looks as if this sleeve is large enough for a laptop totally unacceptable 
major design flaws buy kensington version instead i purchased this product but after months of frustrating use wound up throwing it away the first problem is that the structural support of the power tips between the laptop plug and the cord plug is the electrical solder ! the effect of this is that if you use the adapter on the road where it s subject to a lot of plug and unplug and varying mechanical stress the solder breaks you then at best have a tip with an intermittent connection i replaced the tip twice before giving up and getting another better designed adapter the second problem is that when i unplugged the power adapter from the wall it would cause my laptop ibm t to emergency power off unplugged at the laptop plug was fine i understand this to be an issue between the t power system and a surge issue in the adapter i replaced this with a kensington w adapter it looks almost like the same product same oem except they have stronger power tips it also didn t have the power off issue i loved the form factor but the product just didn t work 
not worth the money it s no wonder the product description was so sparse what i got was a small piece of thin plastic the size of the screen and a piece of scotch tape stuck to it i guess i was supposed to tape this plastic er the screen protector onto the screen but there wasn t even enough tape to keep the plastic on ! this is the biggest waste of i ve ever spent there are better cheaper products out there that are actually worth the money 
cables unlimited single db parallel pci i o card this item really sucked it never really worked i would of sent it back but being a low price it wasn t worth my time i tried it on differant computers and printers same result 
hp has awful software i installed this machine on a home office network via ethernet the install took awhile and changed registry settings without asking uninstall did not restore the system to it s original state only hours of manual resetting did that how many users can restore the registry further the software drivers do not like the printer turned off or missing if you install this on a road laptop you can expect a program hpzinw exe to search for the missing printer every seconds or so using all available cpu time if you are unlucky enough to be in the middle of a client presentation the chances are good that you have just lost the job if you turn off the printer in the office your office systems will also search for the printer and display an unclosable dialog asking you to switch to an unknown program while using most of their available cpu time please note that hidden dlls are also running at all times this software is totally equivalent to a virus except for duplication i returned this system and will never buy another hp product 
don t buy this remote i will make this review very simple no matter what features you find attractive about this remote its shear size makes the thing clunky and unuseable unless you have large hands you will have trouble accessing all the buttons without handing it make sure you go to a retail store and hold it first before you buy it in terms of features the remote has only the simplest of learning features if you want a custom interface for a piece of hardware it doesn t have a code for good luck 
buyer beware before you buy this drive be sure to google cypress atlp rc and western digital until yesterday i recommended this drive to everyone then my drive failed prompting me for new hardware and to install a driver for cypress atlp rc it appears that there is a chip in the drive housing manufactured by cypress that is failing in drives left and right class action suit anyone the western digital support staff is no help act like they have never heard of this error offer no option to just switch out the housing will replace drive but you lose all the data there are replacement housings available but you void your warranty bottom line if you buy this drive be prepared for it to fail keep everything backed up because there will come a day that this drive will fail 
unfortunately it s flawed as expected the audiostation sounds very good however there are some functional problems that ruin the experience on the unit both volume controls turn down the sound level every time the ipod is turned on while in the audiostation it defaults to shuffle mode regardless of how you left it the power supply brick was unexpected i hate them and it s too loose fitting the plug falls out with the slightest nudge i have no idea how this product made it through the quality control department shame on logitech drop this failure and start over 
mediocre remote inferior to other philips remotes this remote controller was quite a dissapointment i am using two other philips magnavox remotes that are far more convenient and operate better this one does not look like the picture which looks more like the model it does not cover the equipment i have while the model does it s learning mode is flaky and unreliable to say the least the range is shorter then that of the s conclusion this would make for a nice ornament it does look nice and if you are lucky you may be able to control some devices 
frisbees or coasters i looked for reviews of these and found i am not the only one having problems i have used about so far and they are generally recording fine in itunes the problem is that my car stereo will not read them the stereo works just fine with other brands of cd r but these just spin and spin until i get an error message next time i will go back to the hp cds and wait until they go on sale 
lousy sound quality even at i have returned this item to amazon i paid when they had it in stock the audio out on this dock is a stereo mini jack the connection is terrible from then getgo with low volume distortion and noise when the jack is jiggled i would highly recommend the dock they re currently selling at radio shack for it has rca outputs on the back and excellent sound quality it charges and the remote has a menu button 
buyer beware i returned this contract and asked for a refund but new ignored my first two emails then i called them and they informed me of their shady business practice that it would take weeks to refund my account i then contacted amazon and they resolved the matter in one day i read reviews for new and most people that actually had to deal with new were not happy the positive rating they have is misleading because the majority of people rating them have never actually had to use the product 
garbage we ve been through generations of this phone and they suck why we gave them a second chance i don t know the buttons that get used the most stop functioning after about a couple of years then it s off to the landfill i am fed up with this trend in products to stop working after a limited amount of time so long motorola 
is it live or is it memorex i hope it s live because if it s memorex it s crap ! that s my latest opinion after using this product i have a liteon sohw s and it hates memorex i rarely get a decent burn more often than not i ll discover while watching my movies just how horrid the quality it my movies will skip stutter or stop all together so disappointing ! unfortunately i found out too late that memorex uses cmc media which only has a success rate ! 
prepare to lose your music i have about live concerts that i burned onto tdk discs about years ago none of them are playable now going forward i will only use mitsui gold cds 
another fuse it came with the stickers all peeling off used it for about a month and the item failed on me then the bad news it blew the fuses in my car and all my electronics stopped working tried it on a friends car and i blew his fuses car and person look for something else seems to be a common problem update linksys replaced this product instantly works but a little worried it will fail again update on update died again 
a usb hub would work just as well i was very disppointed in the video performance of this product i installed it on my new hp laptop with a ghz centrino duo processor which took a phone call to tech support and a download of new drivers and found that there was a significant delay between what i was doing with the mouse and what i was watching on the screen the resolution you re able to display on the external monitor is also limited a fact which would have influenced my purchase without video capabilities that actually work this product is a very expensive usb hub i m returning my docking station and using a usb hub it only adds one more plug instead of power and docking station i m plugging in power usb hub and vga cable and works infinitely better 
compatabilty problems i just bought a pack of these along with my new liteon dvd burner to bad only half of the cd players in my house can even read them i dont think its the lightscribe side thats causing the problem as it doesn t seem to matter if i lightscribe them or not the burner works fine with all of the other media i ve tried so i d avoid these discs like the plague 
sony vrdvc is an excellent product it came within one week of being ordered it is an excellent product and is as advertised i received a manual for sony s compact disc recorder instead of the manual for the vrdvc 
read if you can t turn on your new player when you receive your new zen vision m there is a very good chance that the player can neither be turned on nor be charged if it cannot be even turned on all other pros and cons of the unit are irrelevant so i will spare all such details in my review in my case it took me two replacements and a lot of headache to finally figure this out here s the issue if your new player s battery is completely drained which is often the case due to inventory sitting in some warehouse for a long time then you re in for a world of pain ! the player is not shipped with a wall charger so out of box the only way to charge the player is to connect to your pc and charge it via the usb here comes the rub in order for the charging logic in the embedded code to activate the player needs to be turned on and recognized by your computer s usb controller ! but if your battery is completely drained you cannot get it turned on i think you can appreciate the chicken and egg problem here the only way to get around this nightmarish problem is to find a wall charger luckily i found an old pda charger with similar power output polarityconnector to get the thing going my advice for you is to look around your house chances are you can find an old cellphone cd player pds ac adapter that plugs into the dc input of the sync adapter but for most people the only option is to bite the bullet and pay extra for a wall charger i think it s as low as a company can go to exclude the accessory that s essential for the basic operations of the product even worse no where on amazon on creative s website and in any of the included documentations is this documented very lame i m not a lawyer but i think a scheme this lame warrants a class action law suit mr ambulance chaser please contact regarding this proposition once you do get the thing to turn on then you re all good you can charge it using the usb for the future unless your battery is completely drained again in which case you will have to go back to a wall charger of some sort i knew i said i wasn t gonna go into all the pros and cons but i must say something about the sync adapter the thing is ridiculous ! the larger thanipod form factor allows all such connections to be built in there is really no logical reason for this kind of ugliness why very ugly engineering perhaps creative will decide to exclude the sync adapter and the wall charger in the future 
money to burn please do not waste your time or money on this item unless you have money to burn don t get me wrong the car charger part of the kit is great but the modulator for radio frequency is horrible it provides substandard sound no matter what format you have your audio in i tried multiple frequencies multiple formats and every setting on the zune itself it s just horrible i am returning mine asap i cannot justify spending bucks on such a terrible item hope this helps someone else 
avoid like the plague three reasons why i will not touch any corsair usb memory drive again as the other reviewer pointed out gig the wide thick rubber gasket surround the usb connector limits how far you can insert the connector into even lightly recessed usb receptacles i thought it was just mine ! there is not enough metal exposed so it means the drive frequently disconnects loosing valuable data in the process and crashing the pc often right from day one the drive would show up as a usb hub i think it uses this to control chips inside instead of a single chip but this would at least of the time cause any other device to be inserted into the same usb port on removing the memory drive not to be recognized only a reboot would fix this i tried this on many laptops desktops and got the same results i contacted corsair who said to ship it back to them even though the local retailer would take it back since i was out the country i told them i was uncomfortable posting it internationally back to them in fremont ca using ordinary post courier would have been of what i could buy it new for but they pushed for this without offering to pay for the post so ordinary post it went they now claim not to have received it and now unlike the other reviewer i do not even have own a paper weight id like to say a lot of other things but fear that amazon will not print it so lets leave it at the simple facts above i don t think i have been so disgusted at a company of peripherals as much as corsair and for corsair to validate what i have said is true my rma number r 
good idea but caveat emptor these do work great for organizing cds and dvds and i do still use them but i found that the two inside cds dvds can become scratched by a small plastic ridge that runs down the middle of the page i kept my tv dvds in these pages for awhile and discovered that all the discs on the inside of the pages had been scratched along this ridge a few of my simpsons discs still won t play certain episodes so i keep all the discs on the outside slots only and i ve never had another problem with them i use the inside slots for liner notes episode lists though i usually have to trim them to make them fit right 
far too overpriced for this length you shouldn t spend more than much like the previous reviewer i urge you not to spend lots of money on hdmi cables hdmi specs state that only one pixel out of every billion can be lost therefore there is no reason no matter what the cable is made of to spend money on hdmi cables search the internet you can find plenty of good ft hdmi cables for or less digital is zeroes and ones in hdmi s case either the cable is connected or it isn t 
gb not the previous post is correct about it being only a gig sd card total bs 
works ok but no wonder i ve had several upss now for a while belkin ups quit after about years of work i understand that this may be long enough but i have several from apc and they are still working one ups i think now has been in service or years 
do not buy this charger i bought this item on december th and it stops woking months later refrain to buy this it is better to put extra dollars and buy the apple one 
nice but if you have a problem good luck i ve been using this remote since it was released better than any others i ve run into but when it gets a glitch which all software driven devices are susceptible too be prepared to give up a couple of hours when it s working it s a star device however read on as to why i give it a as i type this my hold time is up to minutes on the phone to nd level support rd call today i simply got a new pvr programmed ok but it isn t the default device when i watch tv also it took two calls to find out my directv pvr is not a pvr it s a satellite as a pvr it couldn t be added to activities because you don t have a device that will change channels news to me never known a pvr that couldn t change channels literally friggin hours so far and it still not right at some point the tv suddenly stopped turning on hours on that issue and it s still not right tv does not go on until i hit the help button on the remote to add insult to injury i can t access the website enter my email as an id and am told it s already in the database i ask for a password reminder via email and get a message that my email address is not recognized i hate that the software doesn t have a simple home button you have to go through several menus to get back to it hold time now up to minutes i have to hang up for an appt so the hold has to be repeated againoh yeah i also dislike the size of the buttons especially the numbers cell phone sized no doubt designed for a dainty child i could go on but if another comes out with a product like this one i ll be looking hard at it 
do not buy i bought being stupid and thinking they would surely fit my standard size coby dvd players they did not when i went to return them they said that in addition to paying the return shipping i had to pay a restocking fee so to return items totalling also the return policy is very tricky and time consuming akin to those we hope you get so frustrated you never fill it out rebate cards as to the product i ordered of the same thing and is differnent than the other ! they are shoddy and have a lot of different places where the craftmanship seems poor overall below average product from a company with horrible service if you re going to roll the dice on the low price good luck 
does not work on all dvd players first of all the shipping on this item costs more than the item itself i did get it quickly or days but i had several problems with it i repeatedly tried it on my dvd player and the player hung each time i had to unplug it and plug it back in to get it to respond i tried over times and got the same result each time i tried it on dvd drive on my computer and it hung as well had to ctrl altdel to get my dvd player software to close on the rd attempt it actually did work i repeatedly tried it on dvd drive on my computer each time i got a message saying no disk i consider it item a waste of money 
cases break instantly i knew these were inexpensive cd cases but i can t even open one without it breaking into two pieces

that s it a dollar cable and a cable i was very disappointed when i received this to see that it was simply a package of two cables cables that you can pick up at radio shack for much cheaper just ridiculous the airport express itself is fantastic but skip this accessory and go to your local radio shack for the mini rca cable and a quick search online for the optical to mini 
compare for yourself i own a bose vcs center channel i would say that it is a good speaker for certain applications you will find worst and your will find better a few thoughts many indicate that the speaker will sound better by adjusting your receiver true and that holds true for any speaker it is a slim design true at the same time you can find a few others that are just as small or smaller i would say that it is a matter of personal preference of style what i find is that the bose vcs works out great with my old sony wega from years ago about the right size but switching to a widescreen it doesn t look right and not integrated the best advice i can give is to go listen to the speaker for yourself and inspect the construction and how does it fit in your entertainment center compare to other speakers for sound and appearance the biggest advice is in a home theatre make sure to get an excellent center channel that is where most of the action is and which will make a difference bose is good but i have moved on

it is very hard to update the remote due to software glitches it is very hard to update the remote very seldom we can delete and if there are two dvr boxes remote get confused and keep on turning off and on even though we choose the right one such as a or b software update is cumbersome and take minutes on a intel quad computer with g memory can supply some patches i have the remote sitting on my coffee table useless

routing bugs reluctance to fix them i was a user and fan of iguidance v but i cannot recommend iguidance v until inav addresses these issues on a recent trip between boston and buffalo iguidance v plotted a route that paralleled us interstate instead of taking it check any roadmap to see for yourself how silly this is and no route options not set on local the route it plotted never varied no matter which of the available route options were selected when i passed a highway exit it wanted me to take iguidance should have simply recalculated the route but instead it locked up my pda finally it repeatedly advised me to take illegal u turns on the official vehicles crossovers i work in software development and i know that every application has bugs the concern comes when a manufacturer doesn t want to fix them when i notified inav of this problem they repeatedly insisted that it wasn t a malfunction it was just how their algorithm worked to be fair finally reluctantly inav support agreed to check their code but i will remain suspicious of any software developed by a company that claims that their algorithm is ok even when it fails so obviously in a real world situation 
lacie won t repair products out of warranty have and tb versions of this product one failed after mos and lacie refuses to even look at it recommends i buy a new one the other drive is starting to show signs of failure since when are tb drive assemblies disposable 
all broken the mexican plant must have unhappy workers paks of and each tape is defective either the case is broken or there are loose parts rattling around inside now we ll see how sony stands behind their warranty even if they send replacements i ll probably throw them away it s not worth breaking a vcr on these cheap worthless tapes 
elementary at best i currently live in asia i purchases my magellan on a trip home to chicago back home the default map displays almost all mapped roads and landmarks and even some i didn t know existed i purchased mapsend so i could have decent maps of the area i live and travel in silly me to think that it would perform with accuracy as it did back home the mapsend features in asia where i ve used it japan korea thailand philippines bangladesh show at most percent of the roads and landmarks and all of those are displayed in horribly inaccurate positions as much as km in some cases were talking big landmarks including things like international airports here a very poor product but one star given because it s better than nothing 
great tv when it worked bought this tv in september worked perfectly until it died unexpectedly in february called service at samsung they assigned it to a local repair person no call back finally tracked down the repair man and he wanted me to take the tv to him total of weeks lost on that i then called samsung back they dispatched a larger repair shop after numerous calls to schedule an appointment they finally came out two weeks later and couldn t fix the tv they told me i d have to call samsung for an exchange samsung agreed to an exchange after a week when no shipping company called i call samsung back i was informed the lnsdx xaa is no longer available they agreed to ship a different model instead long story short months later still no tv i spoke to them today and i was assured that the shipping company has the tv in spite of their denials and that i would have the new tv in you guessed it weeks not sure if the tv was a lemon but their customer service sure is ! on the plus side a telemarketing firm did call me to survey me on the service technician

garbage x ok i bought one of these as a refurb thinking that it was a great bargain hey gb for less than what a deal once you get the hang of loading and working with the windows media player its not a big deal to load unfortunately after it begins locking up and not recognizing songs which requires a drive reformat and reinstallation of the songs you get really good at it had it for about months before it stopped even recognizing the hd and no longer worked at all i thought maybe the reason was that i had bought a refurb so a new one had to be better right so i stupidly bought a brand new one again less than this one has now begun the lock up and reload problem within months of reciept and i just recently got the not recognizing the hd message i am in hopes of getting it to work but for right now its just an expensive paperweight i am with these players so i don t believe that they are worth the shipping it takes to send them back beware of this product 
incorrect description no battery box included when you view the technical details for this product it indicates that a battery box is included with the mic even shows the weight of the battery box that s supposed to come in the mic this information is incorrect the battery box only comes with the more expensive models not this one please make sure not to buy this product unless you have a source that can power this mic because without the battery box or a source that can power it the mic is useless 
sadly it s been relegated to the junk drawer i m not a system analyst so i need really clear instructions for any new device i bought this camera year ago to use as a home security camera which i could view from the internet at my office troubles i encountered set up was impossible i finally figured out that i had to disable the wep on my wireless network thus inviting all my neighbors to free internet connection i wasn t willing to do this i could view from the internet within my home network but not from my office had to convince one of my company s it system analysts to visit me at home and trouble shoot the camera s system took her hours of guess work but she successfully set it up and keep my network secure which worked until i had to reset my router weeks of use in one year i have never been able to have the camera send snap shots to my e mail or ftp folder d link tech support confirmed that i was setting it up correctly but the feature doesn t work i was told by d link tech support that i may need to disable my internet security program no can do d link tech support may not have access to this product they are not able to respond to my inquiries they would send me answers but not to the questions i asked the weather protection cover is not designed for wireless antenna and has been out of stock each time i have tried to purchase so i have not been able to install on the outside of my home it therefore must be used inside which is not what i need i could have paid lt for an indoor camera every so often when i have a few hours to burn i drag it out and try to make the thing work for the couple weeks it was viewable on the internet it provided a nice view of my home but it wasn t useful without snapshots or any type of archived image documentation 
cheap print quality is pretty bad there are often streaks and discoloration on print outs if you want a quality color laser printer look somewhere else 
bad item one of the fan didn t work straight out of the box brand new i looked inside to see what s wrong and saw a lose cable to a fan i didn t bother shipping it back because of the time and cost of the shipping 
coby portable dvd player when i first got the portable dvd player i charged the battery and when i inserted a dvd and after a few minutes it would freeze and skip certain parts of the movie i tried to restart it and tried other dvds and it kept saying wrong disc so anyone who is looking to get this portable dvd player i advice you not to becuase it will cause a lot of problems and its just going to be a waste of money 
awful what an awful product after less than a week of use the camera will no longer connect to my wireless network even when it did it kept causing the wireless router to crash several times a day recording settings for the camera software were lost if the computer was re booted the instruction manual is poorly written and doesn t even accurately describe the software interface save your money 
not glow in the dark keys in february i purchased this remote control mainly for his feature that the keys glows in the dark well thats not true in the add for this product clearly says that even in the sony sweb page also appear that information i read times the manual instruction booklet and nothing about it what is this it isa lie or a last time chages in the specifications i am verydissapointing 
don t waste your money we purchased this shredder a few months ago for use around the house with all those unsolicited credit card offers you can never be too careful about protecting yourself from identity theft at first it worked like a charm but then it suddenly started to jam up for no reason we take good care of our electronic stuff so we were very surprised when the shredder stodecided to stop working then last week i added sheets of paper and the shredder broke useless 
kodak card reader i got this from jnr this unit powers up but the computer fails to detect it i tried this on multiple computers may be this was just a lemon i will exchange it to a better brand 
only so so so going from the delphi skyfi to a nexus here are my thoughts i don t mind the passport idea i like it i used to have two accounts one for the car and one for the house now i only have one and take the passport and unit with me the ability to record xm is great i setup a session to record air on bpm worked great small drop out in volume after each hour set but i can live with it did not try loading mp s i don t really have any mp s as i like xm to much now the problems days into using it the unit died all static if any output i bought a nd unit tested and found that the passport chip is okay but the nexus unit itself went bad i m also finding that the passport chip gets very hot almost unsure if it should be this warm but can t find anything online about it id say all in all if you can find the new inno on sale go for it instead 
horrible waste of time software had some bugs but more importantly performance was horrible i wouldn t pay dollars for this product yes it is that bad accuracy rate was about and the mistakes were beyond spell check they look like some new form of reformed egyption don t buy ! 
even gave it a second chance i do not recommend this product i recieved my first audiostation and the touch sensitive controls on the face of the unit did not work both the volume up volume down and source buttons turned the volume down the power did not work at all it played my ipod th gen gb but couldn t control it and despite reading a review about the large power convertor it was shockingly big others call it a brick for a reason ! i didn t know where to hide it i gave logitech another chance returned the unit for a replacement i was astonished to find that the second unit had the exact same problem i was looking for a no hassle piece system this did not live up to expectations when the logitech played it sounded good but i lost confidence and ended up purchasing a klipsch ifi pc system manufacturers refurbished lt price and now know what great sound is as always amazon is the best hassle free shopping and returning even though this product was not great i do not fault amazon for it they made the process as easy as it could have been 
doesn t support windows mobile i am very disappointed in this product i purchased the blue logger to use with a new dell axim xv which i purchased to use with the blue logger i found that i could not make a blue tooth connection between the blue logger and the handheld computer i contacted delorme was told at this time we do not offer any support or updates for windows mobile hopefully in the future we will be able to offer updates for compatibility but currently there is no timeframe what a ripoff delorme has a product that is not even compatible with the present pc handheld operating system i have also found that i cannot upload routes created on street atlas to the hand held basically i have a little electronic map with no functionality 
eh it works if there s a direct line of sight to the reciever in other words if the ipod is lying down horizontally it won t respond you ll want to use a dock or something else to prop it up vertically for it to work 
tg it is not user freindly and very complicated i am not happy with it i even had help trying to decifer it bad investment by the way i am and computer literate learned computers begining in s 
tooooooo sloooooooow disappointed it works great in the suburbs if there aren t a lot of streets close together way too slow calculating recalculating in larger towns and cities also my unit s antenna stopped working after a month i bought an external antenna and it works fine but i bought this unit for the compact size i wish i bought something else 
western digital i have very little faith in them after crashing two hard disks the same day for no reason i lost all my confidence in this company the sad part i lost my back up of huge file cache all my mps pictures documents legal docs etc i bought seagate and fantom drives i am happy now 
good system one huge flaw this is a good product sounds great gets good battery life everything you d hope for in an ipod dock but it has one major flaw the ipod docking port is really flimsy and has no structural support aside from the actual electronics themselves after a little bit of use the connection between the ipod and the dock deteriorated to the point that the volume fluctuated up and down and sometimes the sound cuts out all together if they added some kind of simple support so that bumping the ipod wouldn t stress the electronics i d give this thing stars but without that it simply breaks quickly and no longer performs its only job to sound good 
buyer beware i own this product and have used it successfully on one notebook dell this product is a port replicator not a docking station for those that need tech mumbo jumbo its quite simple software controls this product and it operates according to very strict hardware rules the drivers are very unstable plus there is no support for some ati cards i would recommend at least gb of ram with a rpm hard drive in order to prevent lag and the screen of death please don t buy if you don t know what video card you have or if your computer is slow trust me i have laptops and only one worked with this product don t be a fool nvidea cards have more support 
awful reception ! barely a mile i just purchased these in part due to the relatively decent reviews and for the rechargeable aspect features and brand name took them out to test and really not pleased with the performance in florida so mountains and hills are not a major influence in the performance evalution also it was perfect weather i m not in an area with high rise buildings rather outside of town in a mostly residential area at one mile they began crackling severely with static at just over a mile they became non audibleonly the call feature worked by miles forget it full charge no mountains no hills no tall buildings nothing but a few tree s now i did not expect anything near the claimed miles not even half that i did expect somewhere between mile range in perfect weather nowhere even near it on the other hand the rechargeable aspect is nice the car adaptor is a great little touch but for the price difference they barely outperformed the set i purchased as toys for my neice nephew disappointin 
beware ! beltronics will not honor it s warranty i own a different model of beltronics radar detector the express which i have had for less than a month it developed a porblem with the display so i called beltronics so that i could get it repaired surprise ! surprise ! the lady there told me they will not honor the warranty of any beltronics radar detector not sold by an authorized reseller and she told me that amazon is not an authorized reseller so if you buy your radar detector from amazon or other non authorized dealers they will not honor the warranty if you have a problem check beltronics web site to verify this ! 
cd worked days really won t use the tv but the cd only lasted days and i use it everyday had to buy something else 
i would never recommend this product to anyone i ve only got this thing to work for about hours and that is not in a row i ve spent hours with this product on several machines and i can now say the hardware sucks 
rip off doesn t advertise that you need an ac adaptor i would like to believe that this hub works well but i wouldn t know i bought it to reduce clutter on my desk from all my devices hooking into my powermac i hooked up my printer ipod and digital camera and nothing happened i called targus and they said i needed an a c adaptor it doesn t come with one and doesn t say anything about one in the manual or instructions or their website they said i could get it at radio shack and gave me the info volt amp center positive i ve been to two radio shacks and online they don t carry it i m upset any advice 
skype better come up with something quick or they will start losing market share do not buy this unit i have tested the vosky iogear and now us robotics and they are all junk while the speaker quality is acceptable the microphone sound quality is woefully inadequate i do not understand why no one is capable of developing a hafway decent unit and why are the so small the are so small as to be practically useless the iogear unit does not even incorporate mute and volume buttons bottom line wait until someone comes out with a quality item or shell out big bucks and buy a polycom and the computer calling kit that is available through polycom even the polycom computer calling kit is analog ! what is the problem ! 
sub par i m a tenor who use pc to record my vocal this mic is just so so slightly better than a chat mic my major complaint about it is that it apparently does not have a pop filter that reduces explosive noise due to proximity and breathing if you re serious about getting your vocal performance recorded nicely this mic is not for you 
purchase something else the first one i received was defective that can happen with anything manufactured the replacement very fast thanks amazon was not a problem getting it to work keeping it working was a problem camera would just quit working for no reason black screen let it set for some time cool and it would come back on unit did get very warm but not to the point it would cause a fire zoom and focus was ok along with moving the camera forget about wireless ! after hours of attempts even with a person that works in that field we could not get it to work unless it was hard wired no support from company some have stated it needed a firmware upgrade that may be the cause of most of the problems something that cost as much as that camera should do a much better job i did what i thought was the best action to take return for refund best thing to do is look at other cameras 
brother brandlabeling tape this is the old tape meaning that there isn t a crease in the back so that you can crack it open and take off the protective covering so that you can stick it onto something and actually lable it it is very frustrating very the newer version of the tape of course has this feature be carefu 
this is not compactible for the gb video ipod this is the description for this item eforcitys black aluminum case for apple ipod video gb gb gb models ipod video u special edition this is not compactible for the gb video ipod 
very bad product i wish i never bought this phone like some others mentioned it was a huge waste the landline connection works but it is very difficult to hear the other person on the line sometimes it is very loud sometimes you can t tell what he she is saying the volume controls are difficult to balance the menus are very badly designed makes you feel like the phone is a kids toy or something when dialing a number you will be faced with the number being pressed twice or sometimes it wont appear on the screen this is because of the lousy design of the keypad i have hooked it up to my pc and at first it worked and the pc recognized it and it was ok the second time i unhooked it and then retried connecting it and the pc didnt find it i unloaded the software reloaded but nothing believe me if you like using the yahoo voice features stick with a set of headsets and mic if you want to get tacky maybe get some bluetooth gear but this phone is not worth a cent 
sucks this thing sucks as does their telephone support was told that it didn t support using computers it seems it should am still on hold while i write this 
warning does not work with sangean radio this adaptor is suggested as an accessory on the web page selling the sangean dt v am fm stereo pocket size radio it will not work as the polarity is opposite of what is needed 
usable but critically flawed the plastic case is sturdy and clear viewing the video screen through the plastic is not a problem there are however two major design flaws the cutout hole for the hold button is only slightly larger than the hold button itself though this offers the best protection it makes the hold button very difficult to reach since the plastic is thick the bottom of the case leaves a hole for the sync charge cable however because of the proximity of the hinges it s almost impossible to use the apple provided usb sync cable since this cable is the locking variety with the unlock buttons on the sides of the cable plug once the sync cable is inserted and the lock engaged a narrow object like a knife blade or ruler is required to disengage the cable because of these two faults i cannot recommend this product it should have been tested more before going to market 
highly frustrated after my trusty archos player s display broke i figured i upgrade and get me a gb iaudio x as a journalist doing interviews i was also very giddy to get the line in to record interviews straight to mp a friend of mine loves his player so i didn t even flinch when i saw the price ever since then i regret my decision apparently my player has a software problem it speeds up all my mp files i tried several different programs to rip the mps and always got the same thing that is when i was actually able to upload mps because oftentimes i received error messages and the player refused to do as told so what then upgrade the firmware sure if you can make it work and i couldn t the description online is poorly written but it s essentially like this start with a fully loaded battery unplug the a c cabel and unpload the firmware now replug the a c cable and that should tell the player to update the firmware well all it does is conclude that the battery isn t full anymore so it better recharges and does nothing else ie i couldn t get the firmware to update and i tried for the last hour therefore i ll take the player back to the store and ask for a refund and i ll get another archos and continue to live with its misely gb 
no good i bought this humidifier reading the reviews here but when i actually used for a few days i found that it provided no relief from dryness while sleeping or during the day it pretty much did nothing except make the room hotter i would not recommend this to anyone 
terrible navigation functions i liked my honda factory navigation so i bought the pioneer avic n for my bmw since i could not found a demonstration unit i bought it based on reviews and thought most of the navigation system will be similar now that it is installed i quickly realized that it is a terrible navigation system the avic n does not allow the driver to change the destination or use majority of the navigation functions while the car is moving now i can not map to new locations redirect to new routes while in traffic find restaurants locate point of interests in the area and many other normal navigation functions unless i park the car first i called the pioneer customer service and found them to be very non responsive the representative insisted that it is a safety feature in summary i would not recommend this unit to anyone it is not much different from yahoo map 
expensive and hard to find the suspicious side of me wants to believe that hp did a promo with their deskjet c i e they sold the printer cheap or with big rebates as part of a system deal and decided to make up for their loss leader by limiting production and raising the price on the cartridge replacements i would be surprised if there is any difference between the c black replacement cartridge c and the much more common cartridge for the c other than a little plastic tab on the cartridge case 
i was hoping for more while i have always followed the age old adage of you get what you pay for i have to say that i was hoping for more even in this price range while i am no stranger to assembling furniture such as this my cabinet had several pieces that just didn t quite line up and consequently caused me to re drill a few holes additionally while the black veneer is of the quality that one would expect in this range it was already separating from one of the corners after only a week of ownership nothing a little wood glue didn t fix but it s still a disappointment lastly the cabinet is very wide but has a very shallow depth causing it to be fairly unbalanced if you aren t careful about where you place your media i initially loaded the cabinet at the top and left the bottom empty it tipped over forward spilling the contents and creating quite a mess i shudder to think of the consequences if it had fallen on a child or a pet 
doesn t really make a difference i use a laptop since i am always on the go i noticed that my laptop often gets hot since it is on all the time i thought that getting this would help reduce the heat and possibly help the performance of my laptop it works and the quailty of the product seems to be great but it really doesn t do much if anything at all i think the idea of the cooling pad is great but not effective 
p os believe me this is not worth it ! get a kensington i already wasted my money on this don t buy it horrible signal to noise ratio poor reception cannot modulate to more than frequencies does not work 
caused system instability i bought the belkin n wireless router and this notebook card in the hopes of obtaining a usable signal several rooms away from the router the router worked flawlessly and the notebook card gave me a weak intermittent signal where i wanted to use it this was however an improvement over my previous b linksys wireless router that gave me no signal at all at this location after about an hour of use i got the blue screen of death on my new dell dual core laptop that warned that a serious error occurred and windows was halted to prevent further damage it further warned that if i recently installed new hardware i should reboot and uninstall the hardware i rebooted windows came back and i uninstalled the notebook card i called belkin tech service to report the problem but the rep just kept trying to get me to reinstall the card nope too risky i ll return the card by the way when you install the card windows warns that the product is not windows logo certified belkin s instructions state that you should ignore this warning and install anyway i hope belkin addresses the issue with a firmware update and gets windows logo certification 
don t recommend if you have other wireless gadgets i tried to use the sh fx kit with my panasonic sc ht system but it only worked within feet of the transmitter ! past that range the wireless connection could not be made and no sound at all came through to the rear surround speakers possibly due to interference from other wireless gadgets if you have other wireless devices that you aren t ready to part with or if you re in a building where others may have wireless gadgets in close range do not waste your money on this item otherwise cross your fingers and maybe it ll just work 
just like kelly i can t properly review this item my wait has been weeks and i received my monthly email today pushing out the delivery date another days one big difference the item is now listed as available but for more money than i agreed to pay back in november if this is amazon s way of making me take a walk and give circuit city my it worked 
mine was defective but warranty service was quick i used an to hook up my a v equipment a tv dvd player vcr amplifier and an xbox there was a power outage in my community after power was restored the vcr and xbox would not power up everything else connected to the worked fine i had my vcr and xbox checked out and both were fried by the power surge i submitted a warranty to cyberpower and got a new in the mail immediately the warranty process was very smooth and very quick cyberpower paid me of what i originally paid for the vcr and xbox their warranty clearly states that they will only pay fair market value of the damaged equipment on one hand i can t recommend cyberpower because i got a defective surge suppressor but on the other hand the warranty claim process was pretty smooth i was lucky i kept the receipts for the my vcr and my xbox i definitely wouldn t recommend connecting your most valuable electronics with this surge suppressor you should consider a ups even if it s just for surge suppression the circuitry in ups is much better quality wise than surge suppressor outlets 
very nice portable i wanted to add that the pet can do pal to ntsc conversion and does it very well just make sure that you keep the player in the ntsc mode in the general setup page under tv type when playing a pal dvd yes it will convert pal so you can watch it on ntsc tv s using the output from the player very versitile portable indeed and there s a reigon hack as well 
inefficient and ineffective i ve owned this unit for about one year this unit suffers from problems the unit gives poor directions on a route from long island close to an entrance ramp onto the lie to a destination close to a different exit ramp off of the lie it told me to take local roads that s traffic lights i would hit over local roads i did not have any avoidances set in the settings this is not an isolated circumstance but it happens all the time in nyc in addition it s constantly trying to take me over toll roads even though i set an avoidance to toll roads i get the feeling that the unit does not really know what toll roads are it also likes to take me over roads with lots traffic lights see previous paragraph although they might be the most direct this device does not take into account time wasted at traffic lights oy vey the maps are not updated i tried to go to home depot through the business search function unfortunately when i arrived at the destination home depot was no where to be found speech directions are often given too late to actually make the turn the unit also gives me turn directions after i ve already made the turn moreover the screen updates slowly after you ve made the turn you look at the unit and it still displays your position prior to making the turn the unit processes so slow searching for businesses by name category is completely useless it literally takes minutes to find an business by name its faster if i text google for the addresses with my treo and manually enter them into the i the input device is really cumbersome you really need a keyboard or touchscreen scrolling back and forth through numbers is a giant pain in addition this unit does not speak street names only left right turn bear u turn i want to spend time looking at the road not trying to decipher directions on a tiny screen to figure out where to make the turn this unit is really useless at least in nyc where there are many roads ive wanted to hurl this thing out my window on several occasions dont waste your money on this buy something nicer that actually works or buy it from a store with a liberal return policy 
quality control the second disc in this package was faulty which i did not discover until i spent two hours recording a movie there was what appeared to be a half inch bare spot on the outer edge of the dvd r not what i expected from memorex which purports to be the best i have switched to maxell 
usless brick i tried it on laptops and none of them was able to sustain the signal it kept on dropping out ! mind you two of the internal cards did a much better job than it 
horrible o stars is my actual rating but doesn t exist on this site the mount is unable to hold my inch lcd without tilting i have followed the manufactures advise on how to prevent this from happening and it does not work after only months i am now going to have to buy another tv mount don t waiste your money on this product 
short bulb life rated as hour bulb life when purchased today they claim hours bulb lasted only hours service at unfocused does not care about creating a satisfied customer base would not replace bulb even on a prorated basis 
not so good i bought this item from best buy it works great until it was time to change the batteries the battery cover is hard to open which caused a back piece to break off since then the mouse did not work anymore i would not recommend this mouse 
wow that much my father needed a drive to recover some old files on floppy disk why did this thing have to cost more than a spindle of dvd rsbecause its medium can hold over mb of data ! that s almost th as much as a cd r dont get one of these unless you really need to let the old tech rest in peace 
good but this is a good case except for the fact that when you want to charge it or put music on it you have to undo the metal thing and unsnap the case which is bad because with the other ones you can just plug the stuff in with no problem thats why i dont like this cas 
this one s a dud i love the saitek wired gamepad so i figured the wireless would be that much better unfortunately my next purchase will be another wired pad to ensure no problems there s nothing worse than the few times i really need two gamepads that the wireless one poops out i bought this and the batteries died i sent saitek an e mail and they sent me two new ones great they worked ! then they died soon after hopefully their new wireless which runs on one aa battery will not have any issues however this one s a dud 
great gps awful radio i purchased the after finding out that a new firmware edition had come out the gps was working fine the screen didn t blank out when using the radio however when i was using my radio to communicate with a rino the voice transmission from my radio was garbled and had a lot of background noise i verified the channel codes even turned off the scramble mode and the radio still did not transmit properly i could hear fine from my i just couldn t communicate out from it from the problems i ve read about it seems like garmin still needs to work out some bugs and get quality control issues resolved 
noisy noisy noisy pros burner works great i ve gotten only coaster in months nice designcons it is loud sounds like someone groaning there was some previous reviews of noise factor but i vastly underestimated it it s hard to concentrate on watching movies i advise buying another model or even another brand 
sony ever since sony s rootkit problem it has prompted me not to buy another sony product ever and i won t even cd r blanks who knows what there putting on these things as a matter of fact you guys need to read this right here http wwwusatodaycomtechcolumnistandrewkantorsonyrootkitxhtmdont buy sony they need to go out of business they are selling products that either people have problems with or damage their system like the bmg copy protected cd s i use memorex or pengo technologies for my blanks preferably memorex because you have to order pengo from their website but they work great so i d beware of sony products especially ones that deal with cd s i bought some blanks from them and once i heard about the rootkits and how many results i got about it when i went to google i never trusted sony again oh yeah and sony stands for standard oil campany of new york they don t want you to know that because they are an ameircan made company and their name stands so high luckily for me i don t buy sony copy protected cd s anyway and now for sure i won t be there infecting people s computer with spyware trojans and even depending on what bmg copy protected cd you get from them sometimes they can tell when you hit the play button to play a song in a media player all that stuff just from one bmg copy protected cd and you were actually suppose to get only the artist not the trojans and viruses on the cd they are doing this to try to stop people from copying cd s bu they ahve took it way too far i think that in the future sony sells will swop downward 
does not work with large sd cards buyer beware this reader does not work with large sd cards i could not get it to work with a new gb sd card my gb cards work fine but anything over that will probably not work i confirmed with with lexar technical support as they have not tested this yet 
channel did not work one of the most essential buttons on any remote is the channel button and it did not work straight out of the box i returned it beyond that setting it up takes time but is not difficult i am just going to wait and see about the next model that comes out 
this stopped working after about a week when i was christmas shopping i thought this looked really cute and i figured hey it s cheap and looks good so i bought it it worked pretty well for the first couple of days and then the cd playing system on it just decided to stop working i checked all things that i might have possibly done wrong but i didn t find any when you try to load the cd it doesn t let you play anything i would not recomend this product for whoever wants to buy it because it did not work like i wanted it to and it made a pretty lousy christmas present after i found out it had broken don t buy this 
i returned this system in one week it came down to a choice between a sound system with a seperate dvd player or this system the reason i purchased it was because it would save on space well it may save on space but the functionality was reduced to nearly zero the cons audio popped in and out when playing mp cd s also a cracking sound when it actually played the audio hissing especially from the rear speakers when the unit was turned off low volume from the rear speakers didnt play many dvd s right it would just stop as if it couldn t read it will not read dvd rrwsstuttering picture it did this on all dvd s played every few seconds it was an intermittent length of time between ocurrences it looked as if it would drop a few frames the audio never varied from being spot on but it looked as if the player couldn t keep up with the dvd this is what killed it for me this could be because of a defective unit however i will not be risking my money on another philips player the pros good audio output that s about it my expectations were disappointed horribly i will not be buying another philips if i can help it at all instead i bought a sony slimline dvd player with a sound system and it is far superior far and it plays dvd rrws 
don t buy i got this cd player because i thought sony was a good company plus i liked the look of it but after just months after purchase and not even using it that often it has already broken i paid about dollars for this cd player so i am very disappointed if i were you i would buy a different cd player 
horrible sound these earbuds are great for the retractibility feature it works quite well but that s it ! they have probably the worst sound i ve ever heard from any earbud style headphones and i ve tried quite a few dont bother 
limited use if you don t live in a highly populated city the price is not warranted to its usefulness garmin needs to have a chip to up grade changes in the nuvi in the restaurant section each year this week i went to three places coded in for italain two had changed and one was out of business 
this is junk and it doesn t last months i got this for christmas last year i hardly use the thing and when i have i have been very careful in placing the ipod on and off of it i can no longer play an ipod on it as there is no sound or too much static apparently a short of some sort i was shocked as it had been used maybe times by my wife and i read all of the reviews i am not the only one who now has an overpriced doorstop save your money and buy something else take your time and read through the cotton candy reviews which bump this up to an artificially high rating of and you will see one consistent pattern the connection to the ipod is very poor the alarm doesn t function and they feel it is overpriced 
looks good needs a lot of attention brought this home and immediately there are problems it will only work if the unit is tilted so i put a napkin folded up under one side it works but seems a little silly there is some sensor in there that needs to be in contact with water and somehow mine only works with the leaning tower approach avoid this one 
not universal this piece of junk will not work in all cigarette lighters it works in a nissan quest but not in a lexus rx 
stopped working after an year bought this from amazon worked well for compact flash cards always complained that i should format the card whenever i used multimedia card from kodak camera so i was never able to use it to transfer pictures from a kodak camera and all of a sudden it died on me had to throw it out 
please heed these reviews and don t support this product i was extremely excited by the marketing of these waterproof headphones what a disappointment the first pair was muffled and then broke within a week they sent me another pair but still after hours of fiddling cutting buying wax buying a swim cap the sound was muffled and very poor quality clearly they don t even think their product works as demonstrated by the exceptionally restrictive return policy purchase this product at your own risk 
consumer reports gives panisonic repair excellent not this used years by parents that used dvd twice a month h errorh errorcalled repair said motor and laser errorsalthough i have taken apart laser at least lights and motor does go can get it to read disc if unit is deg but will only read for min very modual design if i could get the assembly for i might repair but then again my dvd player is still working with similar use

less than a year and gone i really needed this printer i even overlooked the shaking of the printer and table it sat on during printing in less than a year the scanner errors began and the ink catridge symbols are a problem i have always loved hp but now will try a canon printer 
not worth the money or hassle to be honest i have always used and enjoyed reliable service from linksys networking products until now that is i purchased the wcg v unit to replace an obsolete surfboard modem because the wcg is an all inone router modem solution offering both wired and wireless connectivity i thought this would be a great thing and it would be except for one major technical issue it suffers from a connectivity issue resulting in extremely frequent modem disconnect resets often multiple resets within a single hour and while a major of the complaints posted in the forums on linksys s website are concerning this problem in the wireless operation it also applies to wired operation as well coax and usb connections if the wcg router modem worked as advertised i would give it a star rating for it s easy setup and features however given that this serious connectivity problem has been reported to linksys as early as march without any corrective measure or firmware fix being offered to the customer i would rate this as star if given the option 
i am unable to verify its ultra high performance i bought the mvsv m cable and put it between my pioneer v dvd player and sony wega tv kv fs i was unable to see with my naked eyes any improvement regading the visual quality color sharpness same as the result as i used the composite cable came with the box i really don t know why i have to say my tv is a good one and the picture quality is already satisfactory even i don t use dvd player unfortunately my dvd player does not have component jack to let me try the next level video experience i don t want to say this expensive cable is a poor one i was just unable to verify its alledged ultra high performance we just don t have a benchmark to evaluate it 
not very good i use a plastic water bottle and the only part that is kept cold is the bottom 
too hard to open it is difficult not to break them when first trying to open them on the flip side once they have been opened once they don t reclose very well 
coby dvd player the picture is really nice but playback time did not last long first time charge lasted less than hour and playback time indicated low battery before the end of a movie less than hours long still need to recharge and try again and see if playback lasts longer this time around really like the slim design and really good picture quality but not happy with battery life 
stops working after months this dvd player does play all types of dvds no matter how you burn it but like other reviews it stopped working after months in my case it was months it just doesn t turn on anymore i unplugged everything and replugged it but it just went dead i don t watch dvds much so it s not like i overused it go with another model this one has problems i thought mines would be the exception but i guess not and now i can t return it because it s been over days 
does not work with kingston minisd gb if there was a rating i would choose it i bought this with the kingston minisd gb so i could download pics taken with cell phone into computer of course the minisd came with an sd adapter usually computer does not see the drive buty says insert disc into drive e sometimes this thing works if i push the memory chip in all the way into the reader but other times my pics are totally deleted and i have to reformat the memory chip to get it working again it s a shame that this doesn t work with kingston s own minisd chip definitely don t buy this thing it isn t worth one cent i plan to return it any suggestions on a reader from a different manufacturer 
too slow and ugly accuracy i bought one and used for only days and then decided to return it the turnaround time is too long reading speed as well as transfering data to pc is extremely low can not suffer from it any more and return it at the same time i ordered a cpen it is much better than infoscan 
don t buy don t buy this at all ! i bought this to use on my media center all that happens when i plug it in is black and white lines across the screen i ve tried restarting and everything i ll try for a refund 
bad quality great features and well thought out but the quality is horrible mine randomly ejected disks and screen started going bad after only weeks afraid to buy anything audiovox or eddiebauer after this luckily was returned for refund 
never recieved any repalcement paln information i never recieved any replacement paln informtion regarding my warenty i had customer service email stating they would send me the paperwork for the plan but never did ii sure hope when i need to use it i will be able to 
this thing sucks while i m driving this thing doesn t work at all there s tons of static and the music cuts out all the time the only time this fm transmitter works is when my car is still maybe it s because my antenna is on the back of my rear window and the transmitter can t reach it overall i d say this product is garbage 
this review was put off for too long this printer has been a piece of garbage since the day i bought it i don t know why i kept trying as the purchase was made about a year ago it should have been thrown it in the trash long ago and i would have cut my losses instead i did buy one more package of paper and ink mistake i have never gotten more than one picture in a row without an error message turning the printer off turning it back on doing that several times and finally maybe getting it to print two pictures in the same day now it says the cartridge should be replaced when about minutes earlier it told me there were approximately pictures left in the cartridge and i have not printed anywhere near pictures which would add up to the claim of per cartridge i have printed about the ironic thing is the handful of pictures that have printed correctly have been beautiful the one that i printed today was perfect but several tries to print one more picture were a waste of about two hours this is the last time i try to use the printer it is finally going in the trash 
poor quality poor service i bought a sharp lcd tv from j r in new york last jan after a year and half when powering on the tv sometimes works sometimes not after unplug in wait for a while and plug back worked for a couple months send it to service center to checkup was told that the lcd control board needs to be replaced when request to get back the replaced lcd control board was told that sharp does not give back the replaced board it has to be shipped back otherwise you have to pay additional fee to get back the replaced board it s rather strange to hear such a lousy policy from any vendor but if you do want to get a sharp better get a long long warranty 
gone are the days of solid hp printers i have owned the printer for one year the only reason i gave the printer two stars was because when it prints only reliably printing via usb the pictures are beautiful the copy scan and fax features work i have not used the duplex if you want to print via a network then almost all print jobs will sponsor an error message this document failed to print a single print job may eventually print out with multiple error messages and printing line by line with many pauses during the printing process i usually cancel the print job drag the usb cable to the pc i want to print from and restart the print job when first purchased i made multiple calls resulting in many hours on the phone with technical support mostly they suggested that i reinstall the hp software the last call asked i reinstall windows which i was unwilling to do a few months ago i did however purchase a new hpdvt notebook and freshly installed the hp pinter software on it which did not work love the notebook by the way regular and escalated next tier support was offshore each person tried hard but was unable to support beyond reading from a script having little real technical knowledge gone are the days of the solid hp printer product 
stylish but way too small for regular use i ve been looking for this style of phone for a while looks great works great but it s so tiny as to be a pain in the rump to use it s both more narrow width wise and length wise than my samsung sph a when the samsung is fully opened this is still a smaller phone i want a small sleek mobile phone but this phone is impractical for using for long periods at home if it we re larger it d be excellent maybe a great phone for women also it does not have any plugs for headsets i am returning mine to amazon 
don t buy i got this cd player because i thought sony was a good company plus i liked the look of it but after just months after purchase and not even using it that often it has already broken i paid about dollars for this cd player so i am very disappointed if i were you i would buy a different cd player

surprisingly serious shortcomings i work on a helpdesk where our employer purchased a set of css along with a set of older style lifters for which i cannot find a model number to allow us to move freely about the office while taking support calls while generally very functional they exhibit a few very severe problems we have gone through a total of nine of them without resolving these issues the units will seemingly at random produce incredibly loud feedback to both sides of the connection this seems to be related to the phono jack on the remote unit but also depends on physical location some areas experience this more frequently than others so far air conditioning seems a likely cause the units will periodically bleed across channels changing channel on the remote unit or range on the base unit does not affect this you will be treated to static and the combined calls of all other units in the area typically until you replace the remote unit although the remote units appear to correct themselves after time they also exhibit frustratingly poor lifter response even after replacing our older lifters with hls this appears to be a duplexing problem when placing an outgoing call the lifter responds fine but if a call is being received then the signal used to ring the remote unit even if ringing is turned off appears to block the lift signal not only failing to answer the call but also preventing you from using the talk button for seconds afterward when this happens multiple times in a row it becomes entirely impossible to answer the phone at all i am very surprised to read so many favorable reviews after having replaced every single unit at least once we still find them to be barely adequate for our operations i do not believe that we have received defective units every single time nor that our environment is unusual in how we use them i recommend all potential buyers approach this product with caution 
almost good i must have really funky shaped ears because the right ear is just about perfect and the left is just painful add to this the fact that the cord is about inches long exaggeration and this set is a bad deal 
do not order this part from ritzcamera i ordered panasonic gb secure digital sd card rpsdhgua which is a x speed bmsi received rp sdqg which is x speed mbs ritzcamera will cheat you you can find the part they sent me for less on amazon with free shipping 
i d rate a if i could if there was more detail from amazon i would have never bought this item to me the whole point of buying a docking station is so i don t have to lug around the power pack in and out of my laptop case this docking station didn t come with a power pack a usb port hub will almost be as good as this docking station with the exception of a place to hook the monitor i tried to go generic but at the end of the day but a docking station that is made for your specific laptop by your laptop manufacturer you will be much happier in the long run 
beware i bought my i in europe and enjoyed it very much until time came to upgrade it the upgrade that i bought and paid for will not work with my unit even though the people at garmin say it will i am being bounced back and forth between tech support in europe and north america to add insult to injury the last rep that i talked to in america was very rude this purchase was not worth the hassle and the ripoff that ensued 
do not buy looks slick decent sound and great price butflimsy attenna and cd player broke after week on its own i didn t even open it up after loading in the first group of cds took it to jvc repair and they couldn t fix it or find out was wrong ruined my impression of jvc remember the wisdom you get what you pay for 
incompatible with muvo i purchased this card and the sandisk cf simpletech wouldn t format in the muvo the sandisk worked like a charm previous experience had this card fail in a week i should have known better i have never had a problem with sandisk but have been bitten twice with simpletech 
horrible color i have used hp printers for years i administrate a network and have dozens of hp printers bw as well as color while b w and spot color printing are very good color pictures are tremendously dark a print of a picture of a bright sunny day will look overcast and stormy i have changed drivers and re calibrated the printer to no avail hp support while normally very good has been disappointing 
headphones do not work with the pioneer inno even though the inno is marketed as an xmgo radio and this item claims it works with all xmgo radios the connector doesn t fit 
not very durable will need battery changes i have owned five of these ups units over the past four years i purchased three for my mac and pc at home then i had to purchase two replacements for units that simply quit currently only one still works ! i have very infrequent power outages perhaps three in the past four years these units work well to allow you to save your work and shut down my g mac was so power hungry that i had to use one for the computer and another for the inch lcd i can t comment on other ups brands such as belkin but i have seen many competing brands on the web and at the computer stores there seen to be quite a few dealers selling refurbished apc products but this may be a reflection of apc s popularity rather than the poor reliability of their brand my experience over the past four years has been mixed these are not inexpensive units and you have to decide how precious your data becomes if you really fear the loss of data during a blackout then the answer is clear i chose to switch to high quality surge suppressors and never work during potential storms many users do not have that flexibility so a ups is essential insurance the units i puchased were identical and only one unit is still operational after four years i can accept the need to replace the battery every one to two years three of the batteries failed and alarms beeped until i bought new batteries prices vary from to depending on the vendor battery life depends on many factors so i don t begrudge apc for wear and tear on the battery but to have out of units simply stop working is unacceptable i bought apc branded batteries and can t explain why the recurrent failures i m frustated with my apc products but it may be a problem with this model just beware of the hidden costs of battery replacement when purchasing an ups 
does not work in a dsl phone line i received this phone and it looks great we connected it to the line where our old mgz phone is connected to and it brought down our dsl line i contacted motorola and they explained their phone can not be connected to the same line my computer is connected it will not work with a dsl line i am very disappointed a brand new telephone not compatible with dsl is illogical i am returning the phone we only have one phone line into the house the old phone works just fine 
broke for me quickly i have had two of these now the first one broke and i thought it was because i messed it up when i cleaned it it actually worked well when it did work and was relatively inexpensive so i bought another one this one broke within two weeks 
who really knows until it s too late this warranty is purchased through amazon but it is actually distributed by another company when you search for tv warranties on amazon you will see warranties that appear to be the same but are different prices i called the company that sells these warranties and asked what the difference was they told me that there is no difference between the warranty and the warranty they cover the exact same thing the girl i spoke with even asked her manager and he said there is no difference warranties are a tricky item to review because it all looks good until you actually need it so on this one i suppose only time will tell the one difference between the amazon warranty and the electronic store warranty is that the amazon one will not replace the first bulb in the tv but i figure if i need to replace the bulb within those four years i will still be saving because i can get a new bulb for around 
don t expect any support when it stops working i bought version of this card to run on xp linksys claimed that they really support xp although the install told me to ignore the warning that xp was not supported after a few months the card suddenly stopped working i tried downloading the drivers uninstalling and then reinstalling the only download available was the version which i think may be a prolem the setup program would not even run ! i then spent an hour and a half doing on line chat with a support rep his advice had the same results the set up would not run he had me try the card in another laptop with the same downloaded drivers same result after all that time he just told me that something must be wrong with the card and to buy another one there was no diagnostic that i could run to determine if the card was indeed defective i would not advise anyone to buy this card linksys clearly does not care whether the cards work or not as long as they can continue to sell them to unsuspecting buyers 
a good receiver but has video problems i like this amp but it causes my tv sharp aquos lcd to lose synch whenever the video has a sudden white flashes nfl sports transitions war of the worlds death beam blasts drawn together transitions explosions stuff like that the synch loss takes about or so seconds for my particular tv to recover from which is pretty annoying when i had the problem i searched the web and found that numerous others had similar problems with this and other onkyo receiver models but onkyo doesn t seem to acknowledge the issue it s a good receiver but if you buy it save the packing for a few weeks just in case it causes problems for your tv as well given that these problems seem to have been around for a good year or more and onkyo isn t fixing them i can only give this stars 
beware of this product i used this product once and it made it necessary to completely restore my ipod after much much hassle 
ihome is a disappointment so when i first got the ihome for christmas i loved it well i loved it in spite of the glaring bright light that even at its lowest setting has to be blocked for me to get to sleep however after awhile the ihome will not register my ipods existence at all today i was able to enjoy thirty seconds of a song before it fell into disgrace again i would not recommend this product if you want something that lasts this device has become nothing more than a nuisance that won t even pick up radio stations so the alarm can only be set to a vaguely annoying beep when these functions are disabled useless 
poor compatibility poor customer service switch did not work with my samsung t monitor customer service people were slow to respond and were not helpful 
does not work with toshiba laptops beware this unit does not work with toshiba laptops tech support is non existent you will never get through on the phone email support is non existent you will have to wait weeks to hear back if it does work with your laptop this unit does a great job of recording and playing 
antenna not as ordered i read the reviews and everyone had received the instead of theordered and i thought surely that problem had been fixed by now bad guess i received my instead of the ordered today jan so it seems that amazon is making no effort to correct the problem itdidn t even matter that the shipping order indicated a and the ordera was shipped don t know yet what to do with it as others havereceived the wrong item more than once this is unlike amazon 
better options out there this battery has mah while the sony has mah go for the sony 
great sound but in a stone age clock radio let me start out by saying that i love tivoli radios i have a model two with a model sub woofer in my living room and truly love the warm rich sound along with the simple design and good looks i liked the model two so much that i decided to buy the model three for the bedroom even in mono mode the sound is rich and exceptional and the tuner truly does pull in and lock onto fm stations as advertised it looks beautiful and i had planned to order the up firing companion speaker and have the ultimate clock radio the problem i have is that as at least one other reviewer has stated the back light for the clock dial is so bright that i have not been able to sleep since i got the radio four days ago i mean it is bright you can make shadow figures on the wall from the light it puts out i had to put a sock over the dial just to get some sleep now i feel foolish to have a clock radio that i have to cover with a sock at night also the leds for the sleep and alarm function are bright enough alone to keep you awake if you use the sleep function the led stays on after the radio shuts off until you depress the button again and of course the alarm led stays on all the time the alarm is set since tivoli designed this to be a bedroom radio it is an inexcusable design flaw to not have include a means of toning down or disabling the back light for users that would prefer darkness while sleeping i haven t tried the snooze function yet so haven t experienced the snooze flaw other reviewers have but it sounds pretty scary one other clock flaw i experienced is that if i get home from work and go through my routine of getting everything ready for the next day before i settle in for the evening i discoverd that the hour clock will sound the alarm if you try to set it for the next day within it seems a hour window after the time you want to set the clock for the next day in other words if you have the alarm set to wake up at a m you can t activate the alarm until after p m this bothers me because i personally have over slept more often by simply forgetting to set the alarm in conclusion i cannot recommend buying this clock radio until tivoli takes it back to the drawing board 
tomtom doesn t provide much customer support i bought the original tom tom go back in november since then my attempts to reach their customer service have all met in failure my last attempt days ago was an effort to buy updated maps for my product yes their website will offer to sell you maps but there is no way to determine the date of the maps you already own and no way to determine the date of the maps that you would be purchasing in some cases for a large sum of money if you try to find a telephone number on their site that you can call you will be disappointed i am disappointed and would advise you to look elsewhere if you want a product that is supported 
ni regalado despues de una semana de uso el tv presento una falla y hasta la fecha ha sido imposible obtener el manual tecnico de sharp para proporcionarselo al tecnico por cuanto solo se lo venden a los tecnicos autorizados aca en venezuela no existe un tecnico autorizado

a real disappointment my use for this scanner is for public safety scanning i have family in law enforcement we like to listen in i own a uniden bcclt for years i owned a bcxlt handheld my bcxlt was recently damaged needed replaced i ordered this bcxlt am ready to return it also it is not anywhere near the quality my prior uniden handheld was my picked up as well or better than my does here at home this picks up maybe of the traffic of my others whether in the house outside or even right in town the buttons on this are awful too i have to go through multiple steps to do things that took only button press on the the reception though is my biggest concern and complaint i never had to purchase any extra antenna or such for my other uniden handheld to get the better reception also the volume even at max output is only normal listening level so if i am in a noisy environment i cannot turn it up to hear it better my old bcxlt had much better volume an additional warning uniden s support has gone down the toilet i thought uniden was a company that would at least acknowledge my complaint and maybe even have some suggestions of a better product all i got was an auto reply that i should hear from customer service in business days and then i never heard a thing i checked my support question on their site and it was marked closed good luck 
not a good deal amazon has decided to exclude these print cartridges from the free shipping even when you are buying several when you factor in the shipping charges you are better off buying these at your local office supply store office depot staples office max etc the cartridges themselves are excellent just not at this price 
waste of money i was using the tape player for my ipod but since i got a new car which did not have a tape deck i was forced to go to the fm transmitter i had expected it to be as clear as my radio b c afterall it feeds off radio frequency i was very very disappointed it was full of static and depending on the position of your body and transmitter static can increase or decrease i know it wasn t because i had weak radio frequency b c the other stations were perfectly clear so i blame the transmitter i ended up returning the item days after i bought it i m glad target took it back 
sandisk gb i just cam from las vegas and the sandisk has a disk error that doesn t allow for more photos after only using mb i have tried to format the disk using the camera and through windows xp it doesn t allow it to be formatted bad investment would not recommend the product unless there is a way i can get a refund or an exchange 
did not care for it it was bulky and if needed to be plugged into a computer 
problems ejecting usb mass storage device with winxp it worked file with win k but as soon as i switched to windows xp this device was rendered utterly useless to me it won t shut down or eject and windows explorer won t see it grrrrrrrr 
does not work even with other d link products would not work with d link even after several phone conversations and hours on the line with dlink technicians the techs couldn t offer any solution beyond what was written in the instructions and worse they clearly did not care whether it worked or not they could not wait to just tell me to ship it back to amazon where i bought it from so they could get off the phone it was disgusting 
not usable due to sonicstage hardware awesome software a flop since you have to use their software the package is destroyed i will give you the final nail on the coffin for me i tried to put podcasts on the device using the latest sonicstage no chance it wants to be able to find each artist in the sony library this was bad for the odd bit of music it could not find but obviously it can not find the podcasts in their library i had bought one of these and had considered one for the girlfriend no chance now shame as the hardware was a 
eh the silver metal paint wore off within a few months and the plastic clip broke off so it can no longer be clipped to a pocket also the turning mechanism that exposes the pen tip no longer turns without great effort i bought this for my boyfriend and he got a few months of use out of it but now it s basically junk neat design and fine quality of sound but not lasting 
super cute sounds good but i wouldn t buy these again and wish i hadn t paid so much for them either around i ve had them for less then months at first they were perfect because they matched my pink ipod i thought the gooey stuff would feel nice etc i didn t have any problem with the sound quality the problems i have had with it is the first month after i would use them the outer ear where they sit would feel sore i don t listen to the music loud either so it wasn t that my ear doesn t hurt anymore after a use so you will get use to the discomfort then main reason i wouldn t buy this earphone again is because the white cord sticks with dirt like glue after awhile no matter what i used clorox wipes water hand soap i couldn t get it to return to it s nice white color and now it looks off white or basically dirty i also didn t like the part that connects the earphones to the ipod or whatever you connect it too for me i like to slip my ipod in my back pocket when i need to use both hands for something well because there is a bend in the plug it pops out of my pocket disconecting from the ipod the ipod earphones stick straight out and are as thin as the ipod since i m a student i haven t gotten around to or feel like spending money to get another different set i strongly advise you not to buy this product if anything i would recommend the normal ipod earphones or keep searching for some better ones 
will not record i finished up my last batch of these discs bought some time ago without a problem but the next batch purchased most recently will not record on my philips cdr there are too many different types of media discs and not labeled properly should be an industry standard that the consumer can readily see that they can use them not sure what to get now or if another brand will work properly 
horrible customer service this was given to me as a gift the owner s manual and rechargeable battery pack were missing the case was the wrong size and the dvd player did not fit all i wanted to do was exchange the kit for one that was complete when all the different stores told me they were out of stock and did not know when more were coming in i wrote the company hoping to get the problem fixed i never recieved a response and will never buy a mintek item again 
waste of money ok never buy electronics online i first ordered this tablet online and when i got it it installed just fine however the pen was not working had adesso send a new pen seemed to work fine but when i started drawing the tablet itself made the pen jerk at two spots which looked like two strips might not have been working so it was impossible to draw anything with it had that returned for a new one now when it comes to actually drawing the pressure sensitivity and the actual use of the pen itself were just downright awkward pressure is one thing it can be adjusted and i could just learn how to use it but the pen itself needs to be almost pointing directly down on the tablet in order for it to even see the pen was there tilt the pen too far down like a normal person draws and the point of the pen would no longer be touching the pad because it s so small it has a usb cable so it should be plug and play the tablet gets recognized but the pen takes a while for it to even be able to move the mouse cursor around to do anything with it the pen and mouse are wireless so the tablet picks up their signal when touching there s a light that keeps flashing when neither is touching the pad but when they do the light stays lit but even with this happening the pen does not always begin working even if the light is lit simply getting a hold of adesso was a chore in itself after going online sending e mails and even calling them on the phone the whole situation took a few months in total for them to give me a return number so i could mail it back to them until they finally had the free time to send me a new one which is still not reliable now buying a pricey product online was my own fault because if you get it at the store you can return it right away and have the whole thing settled in a day or two sending things by mail takes days weeks and eventually a few months in my case don t buy this or any product from adesso 
okay with regular photos try doing something other than copying or scanning both work quite well actually and you are in for a terrible time the settings are simplistic high print quality vs standard oooo decisions decisions don t try to print anything with vivid colors ! you will get terrible results couple that with the in package software s inability to create x photos that are centered and you have one poor printer i don t know why they stopped making the ip why mess with perfection dont get me wrong the scanner and copier and fax are great if this is what you wish to do with this device as far as photo printing goes there are far better on the market for a far cheaper price 
absolutely awful followed the instructions to the letter pcs would not work once connected and even worse stopped xp starting up had to go back to restore point belkin email support is next to useless i would strongely recommend buying a kvm product from another supplier 
absolute junk i have had nothing but trouble with this product no matter how many times i have dowload new or older drivers the installation is never complete their help desk neither has been able to provide with any help to this problem though they have tried i will not spend money on another dlink product 
easy to use but the sound quality is so horrible i m returning mine i don t understand why no company can put out a decent system to do this obviously there s a demand for it 
don t buy this item i purchased these earphone to use for swimming with a otterbox and an ipod shuffle they are were very uncomfortable from the start but i could listen to music that didn t last long the connection would not hold and if i didn t hold it together the music faded out also music faded in and out from ear to ear i finally gave up and bought earbud waterproof earphones that have worked quite well and cost less 
good sound terrible interface and buggy i am returning this radio even though the sound was very good and except for one difficult station the reception was also very good i bought this to use as a bedside clock radio it has no real controls except those found on a poorly laid out remote the bose for some reason also just uses a remote only if you lose the remote or even if you can t find it in the morning you can t operate the functions changing the clock time changing the alarms or putting the radio into sleep mode all take endless button pushing on the remote it got very frustrating after a while but because i liked the hd sound i had planned to keep it that was before i found out that the radio alarm would sometimes just not go off then the machine sometimes jammed up when setting the functions and refused to respond to the remote or the on and off switch until the unit was reset resetting the unit means unplugging it unplugging it means you lose everything but your presets you have to go through all the cycles to set the clock and alarms the final final straw that caused me to return it and find a new radio was when it started losing the signal from a local station but not the sister hd stations transmitting on the same frequency so in sum i liked the look i liked the sound i liked the hd stations i hated the required remote i hated the difficult and cumbersome user interface i hated the buggy operation 
includes all necessary hardware this mounting kit will be perfect for you as long as you have a stud exactly in the right place unlike most kits that include a cross bar to affix to studs on either side of the desired mount location this kit has two holes in the plate you can thus mount it directly to a stud and nowhere else so if you re trying to center it in a precise spot you better get lucky with the stud finder or have a masonry wall 
gross logistics tail not a bad printer i like the quality of print but as said elsewhere very expensive to maintain ink cartridges don t last long and are as far as i can tell more expensive 
lasted month this product looked light it was one of the best made usb lights fans out there except the light and the fan burned out after month of use because of overheating 
worst dvd burner ever i have this for a month now and i have issues the dvd s burned at slow speeds are skipping and freezing in my dvd players the problem is a lot worse with dvd rwi have several burners this is the most expensive and this is the first time i have issues i also tried different discs the firmware on lacie website was not updated since september stay away from this drive this is a repackaged samsung sh l which costs is a rip off i got stuck with it 
no optical input this system is very expensive but bose didn t even bother to put an optical input so that you can get the optimal sound from your dvd player i strongly think that bose likes to rip off consumers i say so because if they had placed an optical input then there would be very little difference between this system and their system a system that bose retails for twice as much money 
how about a hammer for a stylus this product stinks typically the documentation is not written in standard english but in some cyber patois that no civilized person understands their support material is exhaustive and exhausting and solves no user problem i bought it primarily for book reading and so far have not been able to access a single one the quotdesktop manager quot tells me the quotsynchronizationquot went ok but that proves to be false the stories i downloaded are nowhere to be found i look under franklin reader and find nothing i look under mobi reader and find the same i don t need another calculator or memo book or solitaire game or voice recorder or mp player or phone book i wanted a portable library for fiction nonfiction whatever and this gadget will not give it to me if you remember the seinfeld episode in which the foreign professor threw the electronic organizer out the window you have an idea of what i feel like doing with this thing i bought it from a clearance company on ebay for bucks so it s not a huge loss but i did want an ebook reader apparently there are a lot of ebooks online for the taking or buying but i ll never see them not with the franklin ebookman anyway and i m certainly not going in search of another device once burned twice shy 
yes worst product ever i wish i read the reviews before i bought this thing unfortunately extremely user unfriendly to connect and disconnects itself often kills batteries even in sleep mode the size and precision is good when it does work but definitely not worth the money i exchanged it for a new one thinking it was just the first unit but still terrible 
sure they re cute but sure these colorful jewel cases are pretty to look at but i give their functionality an f as soon as i opened one of these cases to put a cd in it the case broke it happened to cases out of the i have used already i wasn t using excessive force in fact most people call me gentle buy at your own risk and handle with care ! 
garmin quest ii not working properly this gps only work when you make no mistake missingstopbreakchange on the route you set before you start driving suppose it would work on marine but didn t test it yet this gps is for my friend i ve use others for years and i do the testing on this one i never expect it would be sooooooooo slow to re calculatewhen you lost or miss a turn it just frozen there and doing nothing for you lost when you manually push it to re calculate sometime it s working sometime it doesn t seems all depend on if it happy and you don t trouble it too smart with temper isn t it it may lead you to totally wrong direction my friend drive out from atlantic city to philadelphia set the destination to niagara falls but he was confused on the toll bridge then gps lead him back to atlantic city he drove on atlantic express way for a circle till he realize by himself it s totally wrong way to his destination it took so long to start and in my testing of the poi is out of date couple of restaurant is closeout and one of it closeout years ago well seems it did a good job on record the history probably i lost the patient to do more testing at least it doesn t working properly as my old navmin even the map of it is also out of date but i m very satisfy for the speed to load up and re calculate 
never worked about a year ago i got one of these to allow me to play dvds for my kids on my laptop while travelling it has an alarm that sounds when your battery is getting too low well it sounded immediately i figured that my car battery was not fully charged or on its last legs i hadn t tried to use it since now that i m taking another trip i thought i d try it out in other cars no luck the thing is dead doesn t do a thing when i plug it in 
tuner had major problems i bought this slick looker for the desk in my office i had a beat up yo digital clock radio that had poor sound however its tuner worked ok and i figured with the tivoli rep i d get some good listening along with the good looks my office is inside the facility without windows so reception can be tricky the tuner for the pa speakers in the rest of the office has to have the antenna just right i was very frustrated to find that the radio simply couldnt hold a signal a station would tune in nice but the fade in and out to barely hearable i bought an amplified antenna but didnt help then i tried it in a windowed room and same problem i was very disapointed 
incompatible with other vendors poor signal quality this is my second disappointment with linksys products i have purchased this ap to use in ap client mode connected to my netgear wgr wireless router the product comes with no user manual or technical specifications sheet after spending some time trying to set up connection i have found user manual on linksys web site and discovered that ap client as well as ap repeater modes are supported only with another linksys access point it s not compatible with other vendor s products when i tried to use it in access point mode the signal was times weaker then my old netgear si am getting very good to excellent signal quality from netgear wgr mbps and good to very good to mbps from wapg 
you re better off with the cheaper tower i bought this antenna to replace a terk tower antenna i had in my office that wasn t able to pick up am stations very well it turned out that i was much better off with the tower this thing didn t pick the am stations well at all i immediately returned this thing and went back to the tower 
i am not too happy the item is good the sound is decent but i tought than a refurbished item was an item that you can hardly say it s used the speakers i got did not look good at all scrached and dirty you can see it was used for a very long time no too happy about this item 
how much ink do they put in these things i run out of cartridges much faster with my hp using this cartridge than i used to with my old epson i feel like i m being gouged ripped off having to buy cardridges so often 
fellow brand shredders i purchased a fellowes shredder and felt it shredding money right out of my wallet if you ever disasmbled a fellow shredder you would come to see that they use cheap plastic parts where sturdy mechanical parts made of metal are needed this is why most of their products fail and their customer service is as good as their cheap parts i took mine apart as it was useless and time consuming to deal with returns and their customer service there are many other brands of shredders out there and fellowes is the worst so save your money and buy another brand fellows is sure no fellow 
good idea bad product okay so i was excited to get these thought they would work great protcect my entire ipod from scratches and be an all around good product well duct tape will protect your ipod also but i wouldn t use it nor would i use these again so you clean your ipod great you go to put on the covers and they are pain to line up and next to impossible to keep all the dust out a vaccum envrioment like found in labs might work then lets get to the click wheel cover so you put it on well if you move the click wheel it pulls off so i am not sure how long it would stay on as i said before duct tape will protect your ipod too i would not buy these again 
good player with bad battery life i bough this product after reading several reviews from other people pros toshiba gigabeat is really nice from the design perspective the look and feel is pleasant the software is well designed and pretty intutive though it doesn t have the click wheel like ipod but i didnt find any problem using it and going through the various menus they are all well designed and are visually much more better than the i pod or other similar players it takes some time to get use to the buttons and other controls but once you get accustomed then its a zip cons i returned this player after one week because the biggest killer to it is the battery life it hardly lasts for hours you cant expect a mp player to last just hour if i am outta my house i should be able to play it for at least hours thats the only problem which i find with this which undid all its goodness overall a good player if you can live with a short battery life 
hunk of junk go for the manual version luckily i didn t pay a penny for the motorized skipdr as it was given to us as a prize i have the original manual skipdr which worked every time and i always end up using it instead it has more than paid for itself in repaired cd s for an entire kit at a wholesale club that came with spare sanding discs and the whole shebang the motorized version didn t come with any deep scratch sanding pads which i need about of the time for a badly scratched disc most of the time the automatic sensor fails to detect that a disc is even in the machine and won t start turning so i have to squeeze it together to make it work 
linksys cit dual mode cordless phone for yahoo ! messenger this product didn t work like it said it would i think it sucks maybe it will work better in the usa i m currently in iraq yahoo ! messenger with voice online works great for me i thought buying the phone would work good too but i was wrong if your deployed don t waste your money ! use yahoo ! messenger with voice but make sure you have a web cam build in your laptop or pc i would have gave the phone no stars but it would not let me ! 
feel so lucky the remote control is broken when the tv is on a high pitch noise is also on there is a fissure on the left side of the cover feel so lucky that it still takes cable and displays 
i am never going to buy it again it not transparent cover so its hard to figure out which cd it is i had to put all stickers to recognize cds faster 
very unhappy with this purchase i bought this same brand of discs sometime last year on this very site i was very pleased with the purchase then i didn t have one problem with the discs i bought another pack recently and i ve been using the pack i just bought all of the discs are messing up for me i can understand having a few problematic discs but this is insane to have a whole pack of discs and every single one of them messes up for you i wish i could send these discs back and get a refund this purchase has scared me away from anything else related to memorex i thought memorex was a very reliable brand and they would make sure they were sending out top notch items to consumers i guess i was wrong and apparently you get what you pay for don t be fooled by the good price you ll just be out of your money and stuck with discs that wouldn t even be worth using as a frisbee find another brand to use and avoid this brand 
bad reviews but i bought it anyway i read all the review i could find on this product and most were bad a few recent ones were better the first problem i encountered was the power on button did not function correctly i had to press press harder shake the device and finally turn it upside down while pressing to power it on i was never able to power it down with the on off button the wireless ap worked fine but it would not function with an ethernet cable i thought it was me though i ve unboxed and setup wireless wire only routers swithes etc without problems after several hours of trying different approaches i looked at documentation knowledge base articles and found one that indicated if the device power light blinked continuously the device was defective that was the end of it and i returned it for credit i do not recommend this device to anyone t ragan cypress t 
not meant for working out well i now have a handle for my i pod nano the arm snug would be a great idea if they maybe thought about who is probably going to buy this product and what they are going to be doing first off i have to wear this arm band just short of the largest setting on my forearm because even at the largest setting it makes my arm fall asleep from lack of blood flow so unless you are a skinny lb biker this probably won t fit you comfortably the second issue is that there is not a locking mechanism for the strap so when i am working out with my muscles constantly contracting it just changes the strap size and i end up with my nano on my wrist over all this product is great if you are riding a bike or doing anything that doesn t cause you to move your arm a lot so if you if you are planning on buying this for relaxing bike ride through the country it is well worth it planning on using your i pod to play angry music to help give you the strength do that one extra rep don t bother bullet proof shield though is a must since those little screens get scratched so easily 
wow these are a waste i bought two of the packs of verbatim lightscribe cdrs from best buy i would be very optimistic in saying that out of actually worked oh the music burns on to them no problem but when i flip them over to do the lightscribe label it tells me the media is not recognized as lightscribe this happens no matter what program i use ! and what sucks even worse is that with the coating on the cd it s almost impossible to write on so you end up with an un labeled cd anyways oh well back to the hp discs 
disappointing poor design shortly after i began using my head phones i noticed the wiring at the hinges was starting to crack the wire coating within months of not veryheavy use the left earpiece wouldn t work any more guess i can t send them back since i didn t keep the box also the battery pack is in an annoying place every time i turn my head it catches on something 
explorist xl failed in field on a recent trip to lake powell where i had intended to use my magellan explorist xl as a backup for navigation onm the lake some geocaching i am glad that this was not our primary navigation unit ir we could have had some problems the unit would operate for a couple of hours then lock up and not operate until i had removed the batteries for an hour or so then reinstalled them new batteries did not help after seeing the comments about the slothful service support of magellen i have returned the unit and will try something else overall the unit was pretty good and navigation to a benchmark was right on however the map registration for the region of utah that i was in was up to feet off in some cases from the actual position this included a benchmark on a high point that the map showed to be under water road and highway map registration appears to be accurate bottom line if you feel comfortable with taking a new gps to the field that may have reliability problems or other users experience is different than mine go for it otherwise i would try another product or manufacturer at this time 
terrible first of all despite the claim that it works with macintosh it definately does not there is a template that you can use in mac with word claris and other photoshop software but there are no instructions as to how once you think you have it figured out on the page it doesn t print the same as pictured the technial support people have no idea how to make it work with mac and will probably tell you it is a problem with your printer drivers in any case they have no idea how to direct you through the process of using the word template for macintosh don t waste your money i gave it one star only because no stars is not an option 
bose put their name on this crap i admit i am a brainwashed bose fan and love their products i got a gift certificate for best buy and i bought these for around out of pocket these things suck yes the sound is decent but comparable to less expensive sony earbuds that are half the price the cord is cheap plastic that stays in permanent shape as it came from the factory it looks and feels sad the sound isolation and fitment of the silicone ear pieces stinks do not attempt to jog or exercise in these things all you ll hear is the wind rushing in and the earbuds themselves trying to extract themselves from your ear and onto the floor i returned these headphones in days 
memory card error my review mirrors of this product mirrors that of another customer posted recently for some months after i first bought the card it worked great now it has twice caused memroy card errors and corrupted data with my canon elph and photo technicians have been unable to retrieve any of the pictures from the card judging by what other customers have written i m suspecting that this may be an issue of poor compatibility between canon cameras and viking cards in any case i will be buying a new memory card and it will certainly not be a viking 
no vista support for hp laptops this printer will not be supported on bit operating systems ! i learned this the hard way 
low performance on linux first i must mention that the package or manual does not say this card supports linux but it s using realtek chipset which driver r is already in kernel or i downloaded the latest r and still couldn t get anything higher than mbps under kernel some users reported on newsgroup for this known performance issue on linux and one was able to crank it up to mbps running a ghz amd system since this card is not meant to support linux and i haven t tried it on windows i would give it a stars to be fair 
great shaver but missing advertised refills received shaver and it is wonderful so smooth and improved over my existing braun that i thought it was not cutting but it was received shaver as promised but the advertised refills were not in the shipment 
cheap paper the manufacturer added little tabs because these labels are so thin that they tear when you try to remove them from the backing the tabs don t help much and they don t tear cleanly from the label a solution to a problem that creates yet another problem the best solution would be to purchase another brand 
no mac support no dice having grown up with rand mcnally maps on seemingly all my classroom walls in the family atlas etc i was predisposed to like the magellan gps system however the lack of even the slightest intention to support the lonely but from what i can gather creative and pro technology of us that use mac s back it went i guess those guys are still living in the world of the classroom wall despite their venture in gps land tom tom and or garmin here i come 
garbage stops playing and ccompletely shuts off in a minute time frame with a fully charged battery volume max is not loud at all this player is very noisy which makes the volume seem even lower can only stop or play movie without the very delicate remote 
good product this is a good product not as good as an mp player with internal memory as it is bulkier but it is great for the price the only drawback is it is somewhat larger than a player with internal memory running with it can be uncomfortable at times if you are a runner you may prefer a smaller mp player one you can put in your shorts pocket 
chill it luke warm at best great idea that doesn t live up to it s hype two issues it steals the usb ports completely and often causes problems with one s computer more importantly it doesn t cool down drinks or even maintain them they usually warm up to room temperature within an hour whether on the coolit or not disappointing performance 
it s a no show for days well i can t give an honest review of this product because i haven t yet received it i ordered it on june and it was promised by amazon direct not another seller via amazon between june and june so i m sitting here on july with no tv it really isn t amazon s fault it s the shipper eagle but whatever i m less than satisfied with this amazon com transaction i have seen the tv in stores and it looks good though 
i cannot believe the gall i ordered this tv model df as listed here on amazon twice delivered the older model model d which i refused took a total of says off from work to accept delivery have the wrong model picked up then await delivery again but refused it on the spot then they sent me an email stating that the problem was not going to be resolved easily but when i checked the website the model i ordered was still available but at a significantly higher price can you say bait switch as of today i have heard nothing from amazon since the st email still don t have the tv i ordered on but today they sent me a request to come here and review it so i obliged 
worked well until the dvd broke the picture is good and the combo was convenient however after year the dvd broke now i have just a tv this is the problem with combos it is better to get components separately 
ipod fm transmitter although very convenient the reception was not good and the device broke after a couple of weeks i would not recommend it 
sony dvd r x are junk recently bought a spindle of a pack of sony dvd r and all had errors i noticed other reviewers are using dvd identifier to see the real manufacture of black disks i downloaded dvd identifier and scanned a sony dvd r x and what came up was sony recording media co these blank disks are terrible all the disks had errors and half way through the burn process would produce errors stay away from these blank disks i recommend fuji disks whick scanned through dvd identifier is taiyo yuden co ltd and burn excellent and verbatim disks whick scanned through dvd identifier is mitsubishi chemical corp and these too burn excellently hope all this helps 
go additional mount kit this piece of product was horribly engineered it is very difficult to mount the tomtom unlike the mount kit for the honestly if i could return my tomtom i would have done so immediately because of the mount kit 
flaws in excel everything works fine except for two flaws in excel on the numpad the minus key actually toggles shift and the slash key acts as the alt key this is unacceptable i had a logitech keyboard also with all sorts of annoying little flaws which surfaced when playing games logitech has some great ideas and sleek looking products but they are plagued with small yet crucial technical shortcomings i will never buy logitech again 
lost button functions over time i bought this remote to use with my panasonic crt tv in the bedroom the oem remote lost button functions over time just like the previous more expensive sony rm vl i bought to replace it the same thing has happened to this remote ! i m beginning to wonder if the tv is somehow the cause of this recurring problem the main channel up down buttons no longer work so one cannot scan channels the individual channel and pip button still work but only one of the pip scan buttons function the only way to surf is to bring up the pip window use the lone pip scan button then punch in each channel one wants to watch i have a universal mx for the main tv and have had no problems whatsoever with it of course it cost well over and i just don t have that kind of nowadays i ll just have to hope i can find an inexpensive remote that will maintain button function for more than a few months 
not apple easy to set up my setup should have been super simple it was super simple for my old airport extreme mac g desktop without an internal airport card and an airport express my simple goal was to send itunes to my stereo via an airport express after five hours of trying to get it working myself i called applecare after an hour on the phone with applecare we finally got my extreme to link up with my express we had to do three hard resets on my express we had to temporarily hardwire the express to the extreme with an ethernet cable moreover we had to manually copy and paste the airport id number from one unit to the other this procedure was not in the owner s manual or in apple s online self help i have been using macs at home for years and this is the biggest headache that i have ever experienced in the world of apple macintosh i think that the pc guy on the apple commercials got the last laugh on this one 
a lemon i bought a palm zire back in april for and it has proven to be money down the drain i experienced the screen freezing up on me which required a hard reset procedure thereby resulting in a loss of all information i sent it back for repair around august they returned it supposedly repaired and i experienced the same problems with it after this first repair around may it was sent back for another repair and i am again experiencing the same problem the previous two repairs were done at no cost to me the company now says that they will repair it at a cost to me because it is out of warranty the company notwithstanding the language of its warranty should in my opinion stand behind its product the product has proven to be unreliable and a headache be forewarned i rated this product with one star because there was no lower alternative 
poor customer service product defective i wouldn t buy anything from this company they have the worst customer service i have ever seen i got the product working despite the unbelieveably poor documentation but the output on my monitor showed ghosting and poor image quality i called them and after waiting almost an hour on hold they said swap the cables and call us back at least that s what i think he said he barely spoke english i tried their recommendation and it made no difference called them back and they said the product was defective after asking me or completely rediculous questions said i should ship it back to them at my cost and they would ship me a new one in a few weeks i told them i didn t think that was a very good policy id only had the product days and that if that was their policy i wouldn t buy their products they said your choice goodbye that was it well i do have a choice and you do too 
don t bother using the software that comes with this kit the main reason i bought this kit was for the label applicator the software was secondary good thing that i didn t care about how good the software would be because the software for this is in a word deplorable it doesn t have support for any other label sheets other than the memorex brand which leaves you stuck with their labels its got some nice features in the software but their poorly implemented for instance it can automatically resize an image to fit a cd dvd but if you ve rotated it before that the rotation is lost it has a lot of minor quirks like that and they add up to an annoyance to use this if you get this product find a better labelling program to go with the label sheets and the applicator 
junk my old ghz radioshack phone works better the range on this phone is pathetic 
not dependable it worked great for a short time i had only used it about a dozen times when it started to work sporadically then a couple of days later didn t work at all it really is crap you might need to spend a little extra for a better one but that s the best way to go 
poor quality avoid i have a collection of over disks so i have bought many cd dvd cases over the years and this brand is the worst quality on any that i have purchased i would avoid this brand 
not the correct model i ordered the tru and amazon sent me the tru which is what the picture is of on this web page i spoke to customer service and they had me send back the original item and they said they would send me out the correct item i just received the package and again they sent me the tru the phone itself may be great but amazon is not fulfilling these orders properly they are advertising one model and shipping another and their customer service is clueless ! somebody at amazon needs to wake up 
sad ! because i have to keep it for my birthday this philips hts dvd has all the features i need but its mp player is really bad audio just pops before moving to a next song it looks like what philips people just do in all of their electronics i really don t want to talk about this any more because william r french and a isaicu all talke about these problems 
do not buy this product do not buy this product i got this product as a cheap solution to play my ipod in my car i didn t want to spend on a fm transmitter so i bought this instead worked fine for a few weeks ended up completely screwing up my cassette player it would always click and pop out eventually my radio started not working as a result this thing ended up shorting out my radio and nothing is functionable don t get this product for a cheap solution you are much better off getting a docking fm transmitter that plugs through the cigarette lighter and charges your ipod make sure you actually spend the money on a good fm transmitter instead of going cheap and buying one of these things 
horrible it says it s an a v dock for video ipods but it only would transmit audio to my tv i m really pissed about this product what a waste ! a v cables that sell for are incredible they sinply plug into the headphone jack of my gig ipod and into the a v inputs of my tv 
slams the tape against either end tape crinkled could break we received our kinyo uv c way vhs rewinder cleaner yesterday and tried it out today the very first tape that we rewound a much loved disney video slammed against the beginning of the tape so hard that when we pulled the tape out it was hanging out of the cassette housing crinkled i m afraid that repeated rewindings of a given tape could break the tape i had a blank t tape so i put that in and fast forwarded to the other end to see if it would happen in that direction it did i rewound that tape to the beginning and this time it ended properly so this problem is not consistent the tape that was rewound initially was not a full minute tape the movie is minutes long i suspect that the sensors on the unit are calibrated for minute tapes and will not necessarily treat shorter tapes as gently more tape more weight slower overall motor speed but i m not going to experiment with tapes we want to keep ! this unit will be returned asap i may exchange it for another in hopes that this particular unit is out of whack 
pull your hair out bought this to replace my old ipaq man what a mistake ! the battery is always dead even after the hp tech support for hours on seperate occasions patch downloads done nothing lost information reloads bugs to many to mention i wished someone would have warned me of this pda model before i purchased it all the good features it has don t hold a candle to all the troubles it has i d be very careful if your looking to buy this model da 
not cost effective in the case of hd radio the hd does not stand for high definition but hybrid digital hd radio implements something called digital iboc which has only the coverage of regular analog radio poor signal penetration into structures and causes adjacent channel interference when an hd receiver goes out of range of the digital iboc signal there may be a delay as it switches back and forth to analog hd radio has extra hd channels which evidentually are just extra low bitrate streams of repetitive terrestrial radio save your money and get satellite radio wi fi radio or iradio iradio will be appearing in rokr e cellular phones which have hundreds of stations hd radio just carries local stations wi max or wide area wireless access will bring internet radio to portable devices including automobile radios by sirius has just come out with the stiletto which receives internet radio via wi fi hotspots as wi max will eventually allow for reception everywhere cingular and sprint wireless have radio channels available through their cellular phones for a small fee as a matter of fact over xm satellite radio and hd radio stations are free on aol radio so there is no need to buy expensive hd radio receivers 
tape waster big time this labeler will waste a lot of that expensive tape if one prints a long label are wasted but hey this is the trend they want to make the revenue on tapes not on the printers they learned it from hp and other printer makers 
very not satisfied very very not user friendly no instruction to install worked after it got installed but doesnt work with the wireless internet in my house decided to resell it could be its only because i m apple illeterate 
intermittently working i just purchased a set of two channel westinghouse intercoms and they worked only intermittently if i tipped one of the units it worked sometimes as though it had a bad connection i am trying to return them now to the seller good luck if you purchase a set of these they seem to be hit or miss as to whether you get a good set 
retracts well looks cheesy sounds average they don t look as nice as the photo they look rather cheesy retraction mechanism works reasonably well if you re careful with it sound quality is average i m keeping mine as a backup set only 
a disappointment i was pretty excited about this player having read about it in runners world there are a lot of problems with it however while it is advertised as a sports mp player in a lot of respects it isn t very convenient for someone who buys it for sports my issues are headphones are not at all appropriate for sports particularly running they keep falling off so i had to invest in a better pair of headphones kind of weird since it s supposed to be a sports player also i spent at least five minutes everytime untangling them before i could use them hard to change music while running and it often ends up doing something i don t want it to you can t change the music without removing the mp player from the armband which is a major pain and is just a function of bad design that you can t tell from any picture not easy to figure out the features of the player such as the stopwatch pedometer also hard to use once you do figure it out software is a pain to use organization of songs is annoying and difficult to maneuever on player that being said i still use it there are some good features long battery life recharges super quick very cool looking player very easy to carry around can slip it a pocket or a bag of any size i would not recommend this player and if given a choice i would not buy it again 
product stopped working the first unit worked ok for about a month but then just stopped transmitting if you unplugged it and plugged it back in again it would work for about minutes and then stop again returned it for a replacement and the exact same thing happened in weeks returned second unit for credit and will buy something else both units had a lot of static even at low to moderate volume level 
concerned the fan works however when i first start up the computer the fan is a little noisy i m concerned about how long the fan will function 
inexpensive because it s cheap broken after weeks after a few weeks of being constantly plugged in the spring loaded sides that keep it firmly in place gave out now it just pops out of the cig lighter hole i haven t attempted to return or send it back for warranty service yet 
expensive disposable printer i purchased this expensive all in one exactly months after warranty while replacing black ink cartridge the plastic piece that holds the metal clip in place broke off and is not repairable or replaceable buyer beware ! hp printers are not same quality as they used to be this is very expensive for a disposable product 
not impressed at all will just have to keep buying new copies until something better comes along i ordered this on the recommendation of another amazon customer i wasnt impressed i though this would save me money because until then i had been just buying new copies of my favorite cds that were scrathced up i cleaned a few discs and ran them through all three processes without successful results it didnt seem to make much difference with any of my discs i dont think this is a good repairer of any disc thats more than mildly scratched my suggestion would be to just replace your damaged discs by buying another copy of your cd or dvd on amazon many of my cds i have replaced for bucks on here i wish i wouldve kept my 
ok for short periods i have used this mouse for months with my laptop look feel and general use are fine for short periods of time lt hour however i am currently shopping for a replacement as this mouse has one problem intermittently after clicking doubleclicking the mouse will go into a move to the left mode and will continue to move until it reaches the edge of the screen sometimes it will move to the upper left this is so inconsistent as to be unpredictable i will often at least times in a minute period have to give the mouse a wiggle to stop it from continuing frustrating if you are trying to click through a multi level menu for instance another example is if you working on any cad type or image editing project where you need to insert a line one segement at a time mouse will move when it feels like it it was ok for a while but now it is annoying going to buy a replacement if i have to buy a replacement for a product because of how the product performs at an early stage in its life it gets no more than stars it could be just this one particular mouse but then that points to lack of qa at the manufacturer end again stars 
good pack for the money but i had to spend the same amount of money fixing a tuning problem on the guitar and changing the string 
my opinion i am less than pleased with this product the buttons on the player for operating the cd are stiff the location of the cassette player on the top makes it awkward to insert a cassette the remote operates well but it is poorly designed it is shaped like a v with the narrow end toward the holder and it is slippery i had to tape some waffle type foam to the back so that it would stop slipping out of my hands because it was so hard to clasp i dropped it at least times and the battery door broke its tabs so i had to tape that shut 
not working after one successful printing it didn t work at all my printer is hp deskjet c this cable seemed to be recognized correctly at first but kept from being connected 
sangean dt a mfmtv band receiver attrative compact easy to use poor reception on some fm stations my digital mp player which fits into the change pocket of my slacks provides much better reception over entire am fm range 
to slow i recommend the type h for usage in cameras instead of type mas h is the high speed version a higher speed is more usefullwhen you try to take a couple of pictures in a short time orwhen you review the pictures already taken 
need help finding hp inks dear sir madam its very difficult to email you regarding things i can t find or you don t sell i am looking for hp black ink for c printer now you tell me which ink i need no way you can tell because you are not selling or what you site is very difficult to find ink i need 
prepare to lose your data i have about live concerts that i burned onto tdk discs about years ago none of them are playable now going forward i will only use mitsui gold cds 
looks just like a piece of cardboard i thought that this paper would be similar to the matte finish at local photo places but it looks and prints just like a piece of cardboard very disappointe 
beware no mute no easy ringer off no mute button isn t that illegal how about having to drill down menu after menu to just to turn off the ringer otherwise the phone works great and sounds great but these are biggies to me 
ok but not great this has been a bit disappointing in regard to the signal quality i get for my home theater pc i got nearly the same signal strength from the free antenna that came with my tuner card 
there s a reason its discontinued this unit is absolute garbage forget the moronic design lack of features etc the actual construction is terrible the allegations as to battery life are utter fabrications the buttons don t always work but get this it spontaneously erased about gigs of music pretty sure toshiba got wise and took this junk off the streets anything you buy has been sitting in a warehouse somewhere since spend the extra cash and get a reputable unit toshiba does not know how to make media players 
sub par experience well i did considerable research for comparable low budget microphones i have a chip panasonic consumer video camera and i m interested in producing documentaries shorts and travel videos my goal was to enhance the audio that came standard with my pv gs when filming and capturing both near and far range audio i performed a few mic tests to create a standard for evaluation i filmed six scenes scenes at close range with these mics and scenes at long range using these different mics i used imovie to import my recordings to evaluate the audio for this review i tested my on board stock mic a radioshack lavaliere mic and the audio technica mic my results are as follows i out ofthebox standard mic performs with mediocre results less than desired by current tv standards the recorded audio has a slight echo reverberation it performs like a stock mic is expected to perform and produces a somewhat muffled sound ii audio technica mic disappointing sound quality for i expected this mic to improve upon my equipment s stock microphone it did not the regular setting was just as loud and clear as the stock mic the upside is that it had slightly less of an echo than the stock mic but it also delivered a softer audio recording the tele setting essentially acted as a volume increase the subject was louder but so were ambient noises overall it was difficult to distinguish between this mic and the on board mic and certainly not worth the extra duckets iii radioshack lavaliere mic the audio was significantly enhanced when interviewing a subject sitting feet away the recording of both my questions and the subject s answers were louder and clearer down side this mic is less convenient because it requires attaching a corded microphone to the subject s lapel there are ways around this like a wireless receiver but what is gained in audio might be lost by creating technical intricacies with your subject don t forget to switch the mic on this one also requires a stereo adapter i was hoping this audio technica mic would provide an increase in performance worth the additional cost the lesson i learned is that it is all or nothing shell out for a pro prosumer grade mic or get by with what you have you can improve your situation with a lav mic but so far i have not discovered a budget shotgun mic 
good router if you don t play online games don t get this router if you plan to play online games like world of warcraft for example you ll get frequent disconnection for no reason otherwise the router is great for anything else downloading large files browsing checking e mail etc other than gaming gamers stay away from this router 
terrible performance waste of time this thing actually performed worse than the antenna that came with the wireless card that means the range stated on the box is incorrect back to the store for a refund you get what you pay for for 
poor distant transm ition june i purchased this radio for emergency purposes however it seems to be very week i am a double amputee and am confined to a wheel chair i depend on my radio to raise help but i am afraid this one will not be dependable i am not asking for them to be returned or for a refund just letting you and your customers know of a very weak product and i could not reccomend this product to anyone cobra was the tops in radios but something has happened to the quality thank you for listening william hembreewmhembree aolcom 
do not buy this router first of all i am a dyed inthewool techie i design products like this in my job i know what every single one of those what the heck is that settings in router set up screens are so i do take a bit of umbrage when one reviewer called the many most who have had trouble with this router moronsyes i got it to work it will work right out of the box if used with most pre n wireless cards and definitely if they are linksys pre n cards that covers about of those who would buy this router after three hours of tweaking a dozen plus of the settings from default i succeeded in getting it to handshake with b and g mode cards most of the time it would still randomly lose the ip requiring rebooting everything not something my customer would accept nor would i sell some of the techie specs are a long way from what linksys claims linksys marketing obviously wrote the specs and ads then engineering tried to design to both they failed a non techie spec important to everyone is range it has the range of an old b mode linksys router i had sitting right next to it adding encryption dropped range in half again ! the wired router portion of it works out of the box no adjustments required but you re buying this for the wireless function yes i could have tweaked some more and probably managed to get it stable enough to live with but linksys didn t used to be that way i used to buy only linksys considering my time worth too much to putz around with unreliable equipment to save my customers a few bucks on hardware this is the third linksys router in a month the other two were g mode that have been unstable or doa then why did i buy this one it was on sale and i wanted to give linksys one more chance before they lost my business for good they ve now lost it for good i exchanged the router for a netgear and it worked right out of the box into a network running both b and g mode wireless network cards plus it was a lot less money has cisco ruined linksys got me did all the good engineers cash out i wouldn t be surprised are they rushing unfinished bug filled product to market to meet quarterly profit numbers for wall street you bet ! i ll stick with netgear and belkin from now on 
not acceptable in my application my interest in this product was only to provide a high quality stereo audio link between a tv and amplifier distance of only feet i never looked at the video transmission capability but found the audio link unacceptable due to interference from both a wireless telephone mhz system and wireless lan g also operating in the house i returned the unit for refund 
many cases are broken check cases at least are broken in new box i don t want to waist my time to check the remain pieces 
poor design very poor design would never recommend this product the connection is so flaky you will end up wasting lot of time 
ink costs more than the printer i have an epson cx which on the surface looks to be a bargain at but the ink costs to replace colors and black and the black which i use mostly costs twice the color ink but here s the real jab i don t print too much and the ink got clogged some it says to clean the print heads and then print a test pattern well the test pattern did not show completely clean and so i repeated it times then to my horror i saw that each cleaning cleans all cartriges and after the cleanings i was down to ink they don t have a way to clean just the black cartrige or a specific color i tried faking it out by saying i was replacing the ink in one cartrige pull the black out and then back in and it almost got the thing unclogged but on the second try at this it got worse bottom line they give away the printers then get you by selling you high priced ink the size of the cartrige is miniscule and i think you could probably only get about full page images printed for about worth of ink 
one fan made a scraping noise you re money is better spent on another product its made out of plastic so it feels cheaply made a nice thing about the product is that the fans are incredibly quiet damn near silent if it isn t damaged i had one fan made a scraping noise the fans are designed to draw the heat from the laptop but i ve found that these coolers are less effective than the laptop coolers that blow cool air in 
dock is a waste this dock was a waste for me it came with the home av pack i wanted a durable zune case that would look good and protect the screen at the same time the toughskin case does all three and is exactly what i was looking for protection the only down side to the toughskin case is that the zune will not fit in this docking station while it is in the case i believe that is an engineering problem of the docking station this is not a bulky case it fits the zune perfectly however even with removing the insert of the docking station the zune does not fit the dock while in the case why they didn t make a docking station that would accommodate a zune in a fitted case makes no sense no one is going to want to take the trouble of removing a case each time they dock their zune they should take these docking stations back from customers who feel as i do and replace them at their expense with something that works ! as for the toughskin case i highly recommend it the other cases just didn t seem to offer this quality of protection while also having a nice professional appearance 
doesn t charge dell batteries one thing that one needs to be aware of is that this does not charge dell batteries and therefore can t really be used as a replacement for a dell adapter i suggest you skip this overpriced item and just purchase a dell charger the price as well also it seems to run quite hot ive been warned that too much use might fry my motherboard 
don t be fooled this one is junk the write up sounds good with many options and features but after closer examination i had to take it back first thing it appears that the front dv plug was an after thought for panasonic it s a rinky dink plastic flap on the opposite side of where the main av s plugs are located this is often done at the last moment of production where they add a newer feature to an older designed unit retro fitting it in wherever the tiny button within a button toggle switch for fastforward reverse etc looks like it s glued on it won t last long with normal use and it s hard to use and in a bad place on the upper corner of the unit the menu interface is difficult to navigate the remote control is horrible a real bad design for those who want to navigate quickly without looking closely at the buttons to figure out what button to push for each of the basic and most used features you might want to pass on this one remember the saying if it sounds too good to be true it probabily is 
western digital my book premium gb external hard drive with dual interface now what i have saved all my data in some unknown scrambled format and can t do anything about it i was hoping for a storage device that would give me the option of recognizing what i saved and being able to change what needs to be changed at a time when i feel it s necessary now i have to wait till doomsday arrives when i have to reinstall all my unidentifiable scrambled files way to much money for nothing ! 
great design but quotfragilequot i bought this product because i m impressed with the feature it has and as a customer support engineer i need the computer case that has a professional look at the customer place but should be comfortable enough to carry on the street most of the time i carry it as a backpack but it s not tough as it should be it last only month and the inner side between the padded computer compartment began to tear because it has a lifetime warranty i went back to the shop and got a new one after a month plus the inner side i will say it as a weakness starting to tear again and then i will go back to the shop to replace it 
not as expected this unit boasts mile range but it can actually do about miles after that it s quite a waste of time and the manufacturer should really think practically when making these ambitious statements since the customers want to use the product anytime anywhere who wants to wait until they are on level ground without any frequency interference buildings mountains etc and the manufacturer s dream conditions are right in order to communicate 
defective i got this for x mas plugged it in and the sound was great then i attached my ipod and the volume stopped working i disconnected it and then unpluged the system now when i plug it in it emits a high pitched sqeaking and will not turn on 
love the way it works but be warned i m on my third mighty mouse in years at a pop i expect them to last longer ! inevitably after about a year or so the trackball stops scrolling in one direction or another i tried cleaning it with compressed air but no luck i always admire the mm s functions for or so months and then bam ! it chokes 
love it or hate it loved it the first day hated it ever since right out of the box it worked like a champ sounded good used my wife s skyfi in it no problems used the skyfi receiver it came with in the car the next day again no problems with the xm receiver but the boombox is dead if you turn the volume up all the way you get a little pop and crackle thats it sounds like the internal amps are blown it does this with cd fmxm returned it to place of purchase i ve been waitting two weeks for a replacement to come in during that time i m reading reviews and understanding why its taking so long it does appear to be a major problem that delphi should own up to i m not the only one with sound problems 
piece of garbage this item is an all around piece of garbage after about months of light use it is stuck in rpm mode i sometimes use my thumb to slow down the player to rpm mode don t buy this piece of garbage unless you like owning garbage in which case this is right your alley the garbage alley i wouldn t even give this to a bum because i would feel bad about it 
not as good as it should be i was disappointed that you need special disks but even after that the printing is mediocre just below standards that is should be the software is not that user friendly frankly might as well stick with the black magic markers for the money spent a true dissapointment 
junk tons of static and i have a direct line running from this into my car stereo not fm tuner it chares fine and cuts off ipod when i turn off engine but the amount of static makes it unusable i would have been better off with just a cheap charger for the car 
don t be fooled i bought this speaker about one year ago from best buy very disappointed the sound quality is terrible i have two presence channel klh speakers that sound better than this no high end speakers have cabinets made of plastic hence why bose is not high end after a year of misery on my ears i ve replaced this with a paradigm center speaker that only cost more and the difference is not even comparable do not buy this or any bose product at all save your money and buy paradigm b w or similar most of the time they cost a little bit more but sometimes actually less and are actually high end speakers and you will get your money s worth 
not ready for prime time this thing has tons of potential i ordered one and got it up and running quickly the wi fi range was not good so i got online and saw they had released an update so i ran the appropriate function to get the update and install it midway thru this process the thing locked up and i spent about frustrating hours tinkering with the thing to get back to the main screen only to find out the touchscreen was still not working pepper tech support helped a little but in the end they wanted me to send it back to them so they could fix it imho the thing should ve created a restore point so in case the update failed i could ve restored the old os this thing has potential for sure but for bucks i expected something a little more ready for primetime i m returning it to amazon for a full refund and will look at it again if the company is still around in a couple of years like one reviewer said this thing is not for someone who isn t into tinkering with linux so keep that in mind before purchasing it and also keep in mind that there isn t alot of support for this yet 
power problems the power connector on my fs is very sensitive try to shift the unit or move the power cord in any way and it goes into a fit flashing all lights and all connected devices indicate they have lost their network connection my friend reports the same problems with his mine is being relegated to the spares drawer as soon as i purchase a replacement not another netgear a shame it is otherwise a nice switch 
awful i picked one of these up from the apple store and used it that day not only does the product not broadcast well i had to hold it two feet from my radio it didn t even get a signal in the car on any frequency but it dosent stay in the dock connector the transmitter actually will not lock into the bottom of the ipod the transmitter also appears to turn off after seconds of not touching the buttons the lcd screen turns off so you cannot see the frequency it is transmitting on because it worked so poorly i couldn t tell if it was broadcasting or if it was simply broken an indicator saying whether the transmitter was on or off would be helpful and not a huge battery drain if you want a knockoff transmitter that works only when placed perfectly next to your radio than get this if you want something that works consider the itrip by griffin 
waster of a weekend bought it on a friday night spent hours saturday and hours on sunday trying to get everything to work it took tech people and an hour on hold for them to confirm that there were no upgrades to the software to support ma files not that it s just grabbing files from itunes but when i just rip a regular cd it also stores as an ma file so my music was useless on the machine so now i m just left with viewing my photos that s ok i can deal with that however the help for getting a connection to your wireless networks both the on line help and on the phone help mind you was useless after hours of getting no server found i packed it in and returned the item 
good idea poor excecution this product only works for light scratches and greasy dirt and grime it could be better if the polishing heads rotated at a much faster speed and applied more pressure the polishing fluid is also not very good better is compound from an autobody paint store acrylic is acrylic essentially it lacks power i ve polished to a shine deeply scratched cds and dvds using an automotive paint polishing machine this tool is a waste of time and money if they powered it up for more than i would probably buy one commercial cd polishers are available but for a couple of hundred dollars 
terrific portable music for a crowd this player works quite well in our home we just pick it up move to the next room outdoors or into the van the sound quality is better then i expected glad i purchased it 
don t buy i had just purchased the hp cd and some of the cds were corrupted 
not the quality i was looking for i purchased this microphone i am returning it the same day i was looking for a microphone that would work with my pc had a little better quality than the standard ones you get with a new computer sound coming from this was so lo windows couldn t even detect a voice being transmitted cant complain too much it was less than i have not tried this product with other devices i use my pc for all of my recording 
don t waste your money it doesn t work i have an hp photosmart printer that is bluetooth capable with the hp bt bluetooth wireless adapter however that particular adapter is no longer available so hp told me i could use the bt not i purchased and returned of them my computer saw my printer for about seconds that s it after that it was no longer visible i tried everything including making a ton of changes to my system as told to me by a couple of their techs only to have had my entire system just freeze up thank goodness for system restore hp is too proprietary with their products they just don t like to play nice with other manufacturer s products i won t purchase any more hp products their technical dept was not helpful at all ! buyers beware 
nextar mp player don t buy it the unit wouldn t support drm so any songs downloaded from the internet were not usable on the player once we got some cd s burned and songs copied on it crashed and was never recoverable the voice recording feature also never worked like it said it would 
i wish there were negative stars the dvds are a rip off although i m counting on the rebate to at least break even not counting my time the dvd player completely fails to recognize them even after extensive troubleshooting with disk management and ensuring my regionalization was not an issue just a poor product velocity ought to be ashamed more taiwanese junk id recommend verbatim s dvd r dl product made in singapore as a note i can get other dvd rs to work just fine i haven t submitted the rebate yet so no comment on the veracity of other negative rebate comments 
many people are having charging cradle problems once you get this remote working which i found challenging and i work with computers all day long you ll definitely like how it works and it s better than programming in codes the biggest problem is the charging dock doesn t make a connection to the remote so you have to wiggle the remote or put a book on top of it to make sure it touches down on the charging contacts which means it s usually dead when i go to pick it up i ve been on hold for over an hour to try to get them to help me with this issue once again which both of my s have and they re not even answering last time i called they said many people were having the same problem and all i had to do was squeeze a rolled up piece of paper behind the battery to force that connection that solution hasn t worked they re on to something but i d wait for a version where they ve addresed this issue 
i miss my stowaway i bought this as a replacement for my stowaway when i replaced my palm m with an hp ipaq the palm stowaway combination was an excellent portable alternative to my laptop and i used in nearly every day after my positive experience i expected my new ir keyboard to function the same way what a dissapointment ! i can forgive the large size of the keyboard but there are several aspects of this keyboard that have made it intolerable to me i found the keys did not always respond leaving me with multiple errors to fix in every paragraph and the split space bar has been a constant source of irritation i usually hit the solid piece of plastic in the middle instead of one of the keys the little plastic arms on the stand do not hold the pda at all securely even bumping the table can knock it off and i have taken to using an elastic band to keep my ipaq in place the mouse arrowpad is a nice idea but does not justify the loss of the arrow keys finally the backlight does not stay on while using the keyboard and there is no backlight control on the keyboard unlike the stowaway i will be replacing this keyboard with another after a much more careful search 
good when it works the dvds i burned successfully showed the movies in excellent quality the only problem is that for every good burns i get one bad one i m using the plextor dvd burner love it but i m going to try my luck with a different dvd brand the failure rate for memorex is unacceptable it s less the cost that bothers me but more the time wasted on burning coasters 
not worth the time or money this picturemate has been a total disaster after printing just a few pictures the color on the photo turns to pink and yellow put in a new cartridge and it will work for a few photos and then the color turns funny again not only does it not print many photos with a true color image but it is slow and the cartridge runs out of ink after a couple dozen photos do not waste your money on this product 
not compatible i was hoping and was led to believe by the listing that this item could be used with a mac and a pc this is not the case ! in fact seagate does not recommend transferring information between a mac and a pc using this hard drive unfortunately i found this very important information on the third page of the user s guide very disappointing 
terrrible this is not the product i wanted and would like to return it how can i do that 
beware of drm file formats after careful consideration of sites like napster and other download music file togo types the iaudiox will not be recognized or music files drmwill not play even when the firmware is upgraded to b also if you have windows xp the drive has to be formatted in fat and the max partition is g leaving a wasted partition that the iaudiox firmware will not use for file storage because it is designed for a single partition so if you need to wipe the iaudiox drive windows secan do this upto t in fat or a third party software on windows xp os although it needs to port through usb as well ntfs formatting will not work ! as the firmware is written to look at fat sectors other than that this unit has many features and functionality that surpasses any ipod 
why did i buy this i ve been thoroughly disappointed with this system since the day i purchased it first off i can hardly hear anything from the speakers no individual volume control for the wireless speakers i have to put my ears up against the speakers to actually hear them i think this may not be due to the wireless speakers so much as the panasonic system driving them thats not the most annoying feature though ever since i installed the wireless kit i ve had problems with my wireless home network apparently this kit interferes with my wireless g network at one point i could not get my network to work at all sometimes i cannot even use my network while i ve got my tv surround on so i have to turn it off just to work on my computer ridiculous 
doesn t work with the c this mount won t work with the streetpilot c it s really designed for the series types wish i had known that before purchasing it 
sc never again please please do not buy this thing there is a wealth of information by users out there with multiple problems and almost non existent support if you do buy one do not mirror it ! use it only as a storage device without any of the raid features otherwise you will almost certainly lose your data i ultimately stopped using mine and went to a usb firewire attached external drive enclosure much faster a more versatile good luck 
don t buy there are no instructions as mentioned before but my biggest complaint is that the card would not fit into the slot in the back of the computer the usb ports and firewire ports were made wider than any standard pci card should be in order to get it to work i had to squeeze the metal on the top and bottom of each port down until it would fit into the slot very frustrating and just wrong looking at the other reviews though maybe i just got a fluke card the usb ports work fine once installed and i haven t had a chance to try out the firewire ones 
compatibility issues galore i previously attempted to use this device with my mac pro i run the machine with windows xp and mac os x tiger with tiger the machine refuses to sleep when the hub is plugged into my aluminum cinema display simply unplug the d link hub and the machine happily goes to sleep with windows xp the machine does not recognize my microsoft ergo keyboard until i disconnect the keyboard from the hub then reconnect it ironically the keyboard works fine under os x when connected to the d link hub i guess i got what i paid for a piece of junk port hub for under i have reverted back to using my x port hockey puck style belkin usb hubs no problems with those 
unfortunately doesn t last i bought a series iriver to use at the gym which came with this armband at first it was great but it didn t last there are two clasps which don t sta attcked well and the pocket that holds the mp player itself is held together with a glue that comes undone after a few weeks of daily use 
rip off doesn t advertise that you need an ac adaptor i would like to believe that this hub works well but i wouldn t know i bought it to reduce clutter on my desk from all my devices hooking into my powermac i hooked up my printer ipod and digital camera and nothing happened i called targus and they said i needed an a c adaptor it doesn t come with one and doesn t say anything about one in the manual or instructions or their website they said i could get it at radio shack and gave me the info volt amp center positive i ve been to two radio shacks and online they don t carry it i m upset any advice 
they would sound ok if they stayed in my first complaint out of the box with these headphones was the smell of the rubber they smelled like rotton meat my main complaint is the fit of the ear buds themselves they do not fit properly in my ears and constantly fall out if i try to re position them for fit they hurt my ears soundwise they do fine for the podcasts i listen to overall avoid these like the plague 
speakers stopped working days after warranty expired i am an instructor i needed a speaker system with a very small profile for international air travel a friend of mine who works for a major computer company recommended these due to their size though he did warn me the sound quality is average the speakers are indeed small light and they conveniently fit into my computer bag the sound is average as i was warned the ubs connection cable is too short which is an inconvenience but most disturbingly the third time i used these they stopped working properly unfortunately it was weeks past my warranty period their malfunction may have been a coincidence but under the circumstances i cannot recommend these even when they did work the sound wasn t up topardo yourself a favor look for an alternate model there are many choices out there in prices that range from just remember to go with a usb powered model usb power is a must 
misbegotten and hard to use really poor design for usability this mouse is incredibly difficult to use there s actually only one button the whole carapace of the mouse so your hand can t really be relaxed when you re using it you continually have to concentrate in order to get true right clicks in order to get that true right click you want to grip the mouse but the only place on it that affords gripping without tending to cause false clicks is the two little pads on the right and left side alas if you grip those in the default mode you get expose which interrupts your attempt to right click if you reflexively follow through with the click most of the time you ll get switched to another application because hey you just clicked on that app window in the expose screen the scroll ball is a nice idea but it s about half the size it needs to be in order to afford a decent amount of control without that you get all kinds of false directionals scrolling right left when you re trying to scroll up down and using the scroll ball to center click is tricky as often as not even after you configure the scroll ball to click as button you as often as not get a funky mouse scrolling action an icon appears on screen and you can scroll the currently focused document by moving the mouse pointer not a crazy idea but totally counter productive when what i wanted to do was open the clicked link in a new tab basically this is a fussy fussy device that will be difficult for most people to use but since is looks so beautiful they ll blame the problems on themselves and give it a high rating anyway 
problems with springs and batteries i bought this charger months ago it came with kodak ma nimh batteries after a few months of light use the batteries were unable to hold charge as much as ma batteries should if i use the batteries immediately after charging them i can take about pictures while my ma nimh batteries can do if i charge them and put them into my camera bag as reserves they won t be useful after only a week the charger is capable of charging both aa and aaa batteries but a few months ago spring for switching between aa and aaa stopped working properly this was after very light use i only charge aaa batteries once a month the market for nimh batteries and chargers is more competitive than a year ago i would not buy this kodak if i were to buy today 
worst laptop light i have three reasons for my thinking they are simple and quick so here it goes it falls of my laptop very easily it is not very attractive at all and it is bulky and in the way hope this review help 
unhappy buyer i do not remember it s name but the cable required to attach this printer to my computer was not included i had to spend an additional for this cable i had bought this printer for my granddaughter as i had bought the same printer for myself for the exact same amount from walmart which did include this cable makes for a poor buying experience caused by deceit just an ole dog that keeps trying to learn all the new tricks 
poor quality my second one just stopped working each one lasted for less than a year i was a sony fan but now i ll try other brands 
barely but barely satisfactory graphics aren t bad maps are fairly accurate and the same goes for the turn byturn instuctions there are however a lot of flies in the ointment first and foremost very week ability to detect satellites the unit loses contact frequently and takes an inordinate amount of time to relocate them the slightest hint of clouds make this process take even longer second very puny cpu it s calculations are excutiatingly slow so if you try to get the unit to set a route that s longer than say miles you may be done with a big chunk of the trip before the gps actually completes the calculation and of course once the original calculation is completed your current position is no longer the position the calculation is based on and the process of recalculation starts all over again very frustrating unless you are on a relatively short trip third it does have a built in mp player but it might as well not have it the sound is pretty bad and if heaven forbid you try to play music while it s in the process of making any calculation whatsoever the sound gets worse and the calculation gets much slower all in all it s better than no gps but the price differential between this and the better units i have an older garmin streetpilot unit with which i m very happy is not enough to justify the purchase 
don t buy the audiovox dt it will break hello this is my first amazon review actually my first anywhere review i normally depend on reading reviews but was never so affected by a product positive or negative that i felt a need to write a review my experience with audiovox s dt dvd player has changed that ill put it as plainly as this if you buy this product it will break that is a fact that says it all and the rest may get long winded but read on if you want to know how why it will break i purchased this product months ago after months the hinge on the battery that allows you to set the unit on a tabletop and watch hands free broke i thought it was a fluke but was able to get a replacement now my second battery has broken in the exact same place the exact same way and that s after the fact that i did my best to handle the unit with the utmost care since i thought it might have been my fault the first time it is now clear to me that this is a manufacturing error one in fact that audiovox s customer service representative acknowledged yet refused to do anything about since i was outside the days warranty unfortunately i ve only found one other person online who s written about it epinionscom but that s out of maybe total reviews i ve found anywhere online the player gets stars from me because battery issues aside it s a decent player at a decent price the resolution and sound without headphones leave something to be desired but if you can pick it up for or less it would be a good player as far as screen size and general quality goes but this battery issue and subsequent customer service issue is unacceptable people need to be warned when they re buying something that is flawed in its manufacturing and will break another warning is that the paint or whatever it is that makes the sides of the unit black has started to flake so now the unit s good looking design is marred insult to injury i tell ya ! bottom line i say don t buy it but if you ll be using it in such a way that you won t use the battery s stand btw there s a stand that flips off the back if you re using the unit with external power i ve never had a use for it then i guess it s a decent player i ll bet there s better ones out there for the money though ps i finally managed to strongarm a higher up at audiovox into replacing the battery for free this time fingers crossed this one doesn t break too 
disappointed but keeping it i am a bit disappointed with this dvd player i had a pioneer dv c standard dvd player not progressive i recently purchased a lcd and wanted a player that was progressive and upscaling to i i connected my old pioneer nonprogressive player and watched movies the st weekend dvd s dvd rs etc i was surprised that the newer dvd s in looked pretty good i expected to see an improvement in color or resolution with the sony dvp nch however i can t see any difference whatsoever in quality of image as displayed on my lcd i ran the old dvd player with very cheap component cables straight to the lcd tv i ran the new sony dvp nch straight to the lcd tv with hdmi i got the blue hdmi working light and sound and image are transferred to the screen lcd tv but the quality is no better than my old pioneer nonprogressive player did i do something wrong i can t see any color or resolution improvement i may return this since it also introduced an echo issue that is acknowledged in the sony manual the echo issue is between the hdmi sound transferred to the tv and the digital coax sound delivered via my receiver with the old dvd player no echo and excellent sound from the tv and my receiver simultaneous the sony manual states clearly that if you output via the hdmi you cannot tune out any echo created by optical or coax digital dts or dolby digital output the manual says to output the signal via pcm however that still introduces echo that cannot be removed maybe i am doing something wrong but this player is definitely not an improvement over a standard non progressive player in my opinion i thought maybe it was just the new lcd tv but it displays excellent hd quality via hdmi input from my local cable companies digital tuner dvr box what are you guys comparing the supposed good quality on this player to updatei went back and tried comparing my old dvd player with this new sony even more i was able to change some of the settings in just the right combination on the sony that improved the image for the ycacr rgb setting i tried rgb instead which got rid of lots of the red blocky imagery i set the sharpness to and the bnr on these settings improved the image to the level where i will not return this dvd player i still challenge someone from sony to look at the image from my non progressive dvd player i and tell me how the i upscale out of this unit is significantly better even looking at it from the screen honestly i could pick out the pores on james bonds face with the non progressive i player so maybe it is just really good and the sony just doesn t shine as much due to that the echo is better or worse depending on the dvd played i have been asking friends with hd setups and they commented that echo is a problem with a lot of setups tv sound is not usually used even as a center i guess reading the comments here helped me a lot especially comments regarding the feedback on the tv for what grade of signal the tv is seeing mine display reports i with the sony connected i with my old dvd player connected as expected i hadn t realized i could pull that up i would give the sony a for features divx playback sacd etc and a for picture output for an average of but the scale entry above is frozen now in edit mode also i had reservations about non shuffle disk todisk abilities on this dvd player you can shuffle on one dvd cd but not between i plan on working around that by playing mp disks for parties xmas etc where i need the shuffle capability incidentally i like loading my dvd player up with multiple dvd s for an evenings viewing or just leave some favorites in some movies are disk and i have not tested that it ll shuffle to the next disk when the st runs out but i expect it 
don t expect the a i ordered the a and received the a i opted not to send it back when i read the other feedback on this page i didn t want to lose shipping costs and not get reimbursed as the other fellow did below amazon is usually pretty good not this time and not on this product if you want you can call them at toll free us and canada or outside us and canada canada only uk customer service

this backpack didn t hold up pro sits really roomy ample room for my old brick of a computer dell inspiron and my tiny hp nc good sized for overnight consno compression straps when you have a smaller load to carry i ended up ripping the nylon on the bag accidently as it got hooked on the side of a gym locker not as good as ripstop nylon the zipper teeths aren t secure strong enough the bag would separate at the zippers numerous times eventually the zippers all broke loose in one night even the separate zipper for the laptop

don t buy for steaming a v from internet overpriced underpowered i bought this gizmo to watch and listen to streaming audio video direct from the internet i listen watch a large number of programs on internet radio stations international tv news and from the us network tv websites the pr says that you can listen to all formats and cannect up to the web with opera they do not tell you that opera on archos can not do the simple function of streaming what kind of wifi media player can not direct stream from the web archos ! even palm can stream and it is not a media player you are going to spend over before you are done and tech support is either nonexistant or not helpful save you money an double check that it can do what you want it to do before buyin 
the mouse from hell i purchased this mouse months ago and it has been total frustration ever since the buttons on the sides are not easy to access or use but most frustrating is the way the two main buttons perform when i clicked on them they end up double clicking which caused a lot of problems with retrieving my email messages i know some may be thinking i haven t configured the settings correctly but i went over it several times and couldn t get it to work right what s even more frustrating is the support at razer is non existent they never responded to my email questions which i submitted several times before giving up i ended up buying a wacom intuos tablet which works amazingly well and gives me so much more i am a commercial illustrator so it is the perfect mouse pen tool for my needs dont buy this product i would have given it a negative stars if that were an option at it s a steep price to pay for the frustration and a complete waste of time and money 
sony psp cta digital ps bgr rechargeable battery worked great for mom but was destroyed by my year old in about min she broke the pins off that hold it in place when she was trying to change the games the extended battery option was great 
wasted of money time this is a terrible product if you can get it to print the labels look great but it will only print a few labels before stops for no reason that i can find i get an error that it didn t print but no reason why i ve installed on two different pcs one is brand new and same thing happens software is also pretty useless it also prints many blank labels which gets quite expensive the online help is a joke and the technical support take hrs to respond 
i whish i d received written conformation i paid for it and got an e mail link but have yet to receive the written conformation called the it s been a month if it s this hard to get the plan i wonder how it will be if i need to replace my product 
not for comcast motorola dvr users start off with the bad news i have a motorola dvr converter box with my comcast cable service and the comcast remote sends the ads box into gonzo fits attempting to use the menu button on the cable remote causes the ads box to switch inputs using the cable dvr fast forward button cycles the ads through screen formats with each button push etc i contacted ads tech service and they responded that the only fix was to physically separate the two boxes so the remotes could be aimed at one at a time obviously this is not acceptable too bad because this box does a much better job than my philips cineos at upscaling tivo analog cable dvd laserdisc all look better the improvement is more than worth the hassle of having another remote to handle but definitely not worth it if you have a motorola cable box that will conflict stars for video quality stars for user interface which is not so great subtract all but star for failure to publicise conflict and for failure to solve conflict 
scanning and faxing work the time if you just want this for a printer its a dandy little machine if you want to use this for business be prepared to fax your pages twice because you will have to get a call from the receiving end saying your pages are all garbled could you please fax again then you either must run the scan hotfix off of the hp website or turn the machine off this happens about out of every faxes or scans you ll know when you scan something and see the horrible results stay away from this machine if you need it for faxing or scanning printing sure unless of course hp does some sort of new software patch or driver update or something otherwise this would be one of the quickest best multi function machines on the market 
fantastic product ! but don t buy it here i love this minisisc it holds an incredible amount of songs the equivolent of an i pod mini and the ease of use of my minidisc recorder is great but don t buy it here ! just by having it in my order it jacked up the shipping charge by while everything else in my order would have been shipped free and you can get them at your neighborhood radio shack for the same price as here i got a hi md recorder instead of an i pod and i m glad i did just don t buy the disks from amazon 
very unreliable very unreliable i have used dvd rw and cd rw memorex disks on multiple computers and dvd recorders i find that they don t last get about re recordings not may crap out on any occasion multiple cd rw s with critical material would not read on multiple computers avoid memorex dvd rw cd rw disks ! 
defective product received the product it was not fully functional the buttons worked but the mouse would not track i loaded the software trouble shot everything even put up with maddeningly insane questions from kensington tech support did you try unplugging it and replugging it back in however amazon com was very quick and gracious in the return remarking on the design seemed to fit well in my hand though it was a bit bulky usb cord was very long a desktop user would not have any issues with its reach might have been an enjoyable product if it worked properly im a bit disappointed i was always a fan of kensington products starting with the s trackball i also have a cordless optical notebook mouse i ve been seeking a replacement b c it chews through batteries like none other so far i am on satisfaction with kensington mice 
short lived machine avoid this lemon here is the original review of this machine i wrote on june we bought this machine just over a year ago a year and two weeks to be specific we had another very similar panasonic dvd recorder dmre in a different room and wanted to be able to record and watch dvd rams on both for a long time the ess recorder worked fine recently though it has begun making noises when starting up and shutting down and now it occasionally has problems reading the disks ejecting them and even playing them at first we thought this might be because we d recorded over the dvd rams so many times but today we tested one of them in the other machine which has never made any similar noises and the e had no problems with it needless to say we re not happy that the ess seems to be dying especially since the year warranty just ended if you buy or own this machine follow up on any strange noises as soon as you hear them if you re within the warranty period because the noises and problems just get worse panasonic is usually a reliable brand one we ve used for many years but this machine seems to be a lemon we re actually going to write to panasonic about it ill try to post again with the results here is my update which i wrote november this is a follow up review to the one above which i wrote on june i wrote to panasonic after my machine had stopped working just after the warranty ended they sent me a nice letter authorizing a free repair including labor of the machine at one of three places they listed the places were all within a half hour drive of my home after doing some research i chose one and brought in the machine they fixed it by replacing the entire internal mechanism i don t know what that means we got the machine back from the repair shop near the end of july it s now the beginning of november the fixed machine worked fine for a while but in the past few weeks we ve been hearing the same old noises that were the beginning of the end for it before i m going to try writing to panasonic again and asking for a refund because this machine really seems to have something fundamentally wrong with it it s still working but i know from the last time with these noises and efforts to read the disks that soon it won t avoid this machine again the previous panasonic model dmre we bought hasn t had any of these difficulties and continues to work great we re still big panasonic fans but this particular model is a lemon 
did not work for me i was unable to get it to sync up with our computer and we have windows so it was no use to me 
good idea design a little weird and bad sound when you look at a picture of the sony mdr j headphones you probably think great idea i certainly did and i thought they d be the answer to my annoyances with earbuds falling out while i run well that s partly true the over ear design is ingenious and there s no slippage whatsoever which is refreshing but the design is also its most major flaw most headphone speakers which project directly into your inner ear but the placement of the speakers on this set is such that they face forward into the tragus the projection of cartilage that sticks out from your ear which means that the sound is inherently distorted you can adjust the placement somewhat but to me it feels like i m simply choosing the less annoying variation on distorted sound whats more the overall sound was a bit tinny and weak for my tastes i realize these are very inexpensive headphones but even for running i can t cope with such thin sounding music after trying these i switched back to the earbuds i already owned and found it less annoying that they fell out occasionally after all they sound great when they do stay in which is more than i can say for the sony mdr j headphones 
dead after only year i bought this dvd player after my sony player died prematurely is it just me or are dvd players supposed to have a longer life this dvd player looks nice and works fine when it is working the player is a bit noisy when reading the discs though but the bottom line is that it just stopped working after only year of use i expected an improvement over my sony player and i am sorely disappointed 
sucks very poor quality the product is just piece of crap don t waste money on i 
stay away from this equipment at the beginning i really thought this is a very nice product it does solve the cd organize and automatic storage problem for many people however this equipment is poorly engineered i bought four units and all of them failed within a year for various reasons there is no easy way to even take the discs out of the faulty units if you ever think about move this equipment to another room it is almost bound to fail customer service usually take days to respond the phone service guys do not answer questions about disc stakka because they know this is a bad product and rather not to deal with it with the disappointed customer imagining someone charges your to organize cds for a year and then quit i am completely pissed off 
died an early death we bought this tv after reading glowing reviews only to find out that the picture quality is poor when viewed from slight angles also after months of use ours has now died sound works but picture is gone cycling power on off might bring back a partial picture for a few minutes but then it is gone again another expensive lesson 
a piece of junk my daughter really loved getting this item for christmas unfortunately the cd player is not reliable it freezes sometimes for several hours unfreezes unexpectedly especially great in the middle of the night skips repeatedly or just plain refuses to start at all the only thing that works well is the radio we already have a radio so the purchase was a big waste of money terribly disappointing i strongly recommend that potential buyers look elsewhere 
do not buy this for your car the pocketdock is much thicker than the standard plugs and it does not have a locking catch mechanism so if your ipod is in a case with a cut out for a standard plug you need to remove your case to use the pocketdock if you have not case your ipod can easily become unplugged from the pocketdock because the plug does not lock lastly the plug offers a usb lineout presumeably to power your ipod but in most cars there is noise from the cigarette lighter that affects the line out in the pocketdock my solution charge the ipod in the car and use the headphone jack line out but only when the battery is dangerously low in general i use the pocketdock because the sound from the other end is so so so so much better the pocketdock would be a good device if it where thinner had a locking mechanism and integrated a clean power filter from car cigarette lighters 
waste of money don t waste your money on this second room wireless speaker the signal barely reached into the second room and then it was weak and flickered on and off i tried to return it but panasonic wouldn t take it back 
install cd has viruses i just recently bought this and when i installed it norton caught viruses on the install cd 
worked for a while i have a dell inspiron with failing fans so i decided to get a chillhub to try to relieve the pc fans i am just trying to keep everything working for a few more months as i will be buying a new pc i liked the chillhub at first cannot really tell if they kept things cooler as i do not have any temperature software loaded i only give this two stars because the fans are now making a loud grinding noise that is unbearable i use my pc every day for hours so maybe i burned it out i think i am just going to buy a desktop fan and shoot it at the side of the laptop and not get another one of these 
works at first but then dies at restart i was very excited to try this product on my powerbook g it worked the very first time but after a restart it no longer worked was quite disappointed as i tried to reset it and try setting ut up again it was fruitless so i dont recommend this product as i m truly upset with its performance 
it did not work i had to return the card because it did not work not sure if this was a fluke or represents a larger problem with this provider 
lousy pins i purchased this cable and the pins were weak and clumsy i could not even plug it in and one of the pins broke i threw it away it is a piece of junk 
if you have wireless internet do not get this phone i guess i m one of the few people who didn t already know this but if you use wireless internet and other wireless connections wireless keyboard wireless mouse wireless printer etc you cannot use ghz phones without having horrible interference on the phone in fact even ghz phones get some static signal loss around wireless internet connections apparently after calling uniden customer support i found out that if you want to use a wireless phone around a wireless internet connection you must use a less advanced mhz phone i returned this phone and bought a mhz phone that works perfect sad that a more advanced more expensive phone is worse than a cheaper less advanced cordless phone if you don t have wireless internet and none of your neighbors have wireless internet then i m sure this phone is fine 
you re kidding i m usually a big linksys supporter this is an exception this device is a joke not a very funny one the first thing i was told when i called for support was it most likely wouldn t work with my printer canon mp i spent several hours trying to get a linksys router to see this thing with online support don t waste your time 
wizcom quicklink elite pen scannner have to have it and use it to write a review don t you think sorr 
garmin rino disappointment to build upon the reviews as listed below i will expand on them to say that even with the lastest firmware the issues till exist and garmin cannot get it fixed the hardware radio section is also pitiful and is out of deviation but probably the worst part of it all is that after five total sets sent to me from customer service as well as sets returned for various firmware and hardware issues garmin cannot seem to get the quality control correct worse than that is a set that was supposedly checked by a service tech and listed in the report as operational withing spec out of the box was failing that is terrible customer service and technical help i love the idea of the garmin and would buy two more in a second if they correct all the known bugs and issues with the product i do not belive they can and or will and garmin appears to be in denial about this product stay away from this item until you hear that they have taken the bull by the horns and corrected this product 
circuit design problem it keeps trying to jump up to the next frequency sometimes it will jump back down again but other times it has to be reset i have used scanning digital radios before cheaper than this one and didn t have this problem at first i thought it was a reception problem but when it happened on strong signals as well as weak and seemingly at random i knew there was no hope for this radio i like the neckstrap and i use it with a different radio 
annoying scroll in less than year the scroll wheel starting sticking which means that when you want to use it for scrolling the computer recognizes it as if you are pushing down the scroll wheel the length of the wire is about inches shorter than it should be 
i paid it but i never received it dear amazon i paid for this but until today i did not received it i wrote to the supplier and until today i did not received any answer from him 
no radio reception sound is fine for ipod music the radio stations do not come in one local station tunes to all our boom box gets better reception 
good sound terrible feel it s true what has already been said the sounds in these headphones is better than expected but i thought the above reviews under emphasized the other important feature of earbugs these are without a doubt the most uncomfortable headphones i ve ever used they re cheap but any price is too much jvc should know better than to think a clever name and different colors means they don t have to worry about comfort 
sent it back purchased for my daughter an english teacher scrabble lover she said she d rather have a book to look up words and most of the features on the franklin she d never use and thought they took away from the mental challenge of the game she said it would end up on a shelf in her house she d rather have a paperback scrabble dictionary i returned the franklin she didn t even like the idea of taking it to school for her kids to use when she lets them play scrabble in class 
ram didn t work after nearly two weeks i m still waiting for kingston to ship out replacement ram the ram was installed and after just one day the ram caused several of the programs on my system to quit functioning after calling kingston several times they still have not shipped the replacement modules yet it s been two weeks i would strongly consider a different brand next time this company is not responsive 
not a viable scanner i impossible to be acceptably used to scan documents to pdfa if you scan from adobe acrobat standard you cannot stop the hp driver from cutting out parts of the image it considers negligible b if you scan from adobe acrobat standard all colors will be grey c if you scan from hp director files will be times the normal size eg mb file with adobe acrobat standard mb with hp director no way to downsize it 
i just paid for sparkly frisbees from amazon this just don t make no motha since at less than a dollar per sparkly frisbee this is the best price i can find for frisbees they don t fly very well and they break relatively easily but this is the best value i can find for frisbees in one place a lot of people are disappointed because they expect to be able to use these discs as writable cd media the problem with that is they don t work very well for that either i too tested this for myself using nero burning rom i tried many times to burn different kinds of data onto several of the discs at x just like you re supposed to it worked ! it burned fine then it took minutes to open a simple html document on the burned disc subsequent trials run with the verify written data checkbox checked revealed that every other sector or so was unreadable after burning it s like writing with a white crayon except this is white paper this persisted on several other computers with different cd burner drives and even different software i finally realized what great frisbees these things are cheer up people they are great fun ! so grab your spindle go outside and start chucking these things at your neighbor s annoying dog ps i need to sue memorex for selling this junk these disc are just a form of abuse 
mp player and voice recorder large storage volume gb mp player sound quality is ok but the voice recording sound is mixing lots of noise it is not a good voice recorder change battery very hours it is not a good power efficient player 
piece of crap like most of the other people who bought this piece of junk it quit working after a few months you put a disk in and there is a loud noise and a bunch of colors jumping across the screen and everything is frozen i will be throwing it in the trash and buying a reputable brand 
better off without mic i married this mic to the olympus ws s digital voice recorder which by the way plays in stereo when attaching the mic there was a significant loss of volume as the system only used one channel rather than stereo the resulting loss of volume requiered the volume to be turned up during playback increasing backround noise levels i use this device to record class lectures at the college level without the mic i was able to hear student questions from the back clearly with the mic installed i could no longer make out all the questions from the high volume related static 
buyers beware buyers beware ! i have never written or posted a consumer rating in my life i am so disappointed with vonage s overall customer service i feel that i have no choice but to warn others vonage in its own words does not guarantee the quality of its service vonage customers will experience dropped calls garbled communications and a non responsive and dishonest customer service department the reason vonage does not guarantee performance is because it knows that it cannot my first mistake was in believing the vonage help desk during my initial day money back guarantee period when they told me my issues were due to line quality and not vonage since then i have spent three months with vonage and my high speed internet service provider s technicians attempting to make this service work all speed tests indicate my isp lines are fine i had a high speed internet technician visit my house last week only to tell me everything checks out all this said my vonage phone has never worked worse i made a call today and the recipient could not even discern whom i was when i finally threw in the towel and decided that vonage was not for me i was hit with a service charge upon cancellation plus the cost of the phone despite a documented lack of performance from day one vonages performance is substandard by any measure closely look at all other options before bringing vonage into your life and definitely terminate all agreements within your first days to avoid the inevitable early termination fees make sure you read the below clauses in vonage s terms of service agreement before you agree to anything a vonage customer service manager mike sited these disclaimers when i told him that i was not satisfied with the service no warranties on service section paragraph return of device section paragraph termination fee section paragraph and money back guarantee limitations and conditions section paragraph when i switched to vonage i was simply looking for a reliable telephone service and a company that stands behind its product and supports its customers vonage s lack of line reliability and poor customer service has motivated me to document my experience i had to call vonage customer service on my old fashion landline because the voice quality on my vonage phone was so poor that i would not be able to have a conversation after waiting for minutes to talk to the service manager mike i was told that i was contractually bound because i did not terminate my agreement within the first days at this moment i thought of the stereotypical shady used car transaction i was lured to buy vonage because of the promises of great service and all the free bells and whistles that only internet calling can provide instead i received a lemon a phone that was unreliable and a company that did not stand behind its product while vonage may get my termination fee and the cost of the vonage phone i do not feel that i can just lay down about vonage s failure to perform i feel compelled to warn others about vonage and hopefully save them the aggravation that i have experienced and hit vonage where it hurts in the economic pocket book i am terminating my service as soon as possible 
pny geforce fx mb pci graphics card this graphics card didnot work as expected after numerous attempts to resolve installation and operation problems the card was returned for refund which i have not received as of this date i would not reccomend this graphics card to anyone with built in graphics card in their computer there seems to be too many software conflicts 
instructios have still not been able to program this the way it should be confusing controls instrucitons complicated not at all like my old scanner cannot find a way to check to see what frequencies are stored in the scanner would look for a diferent scanner that is more user friendly 
unit will not function in all auto cd players errsejects i have both a chevrolet gm pickup and a jeep chrysler corp and specifically purchased the unit to clean the laser lens in the jeep it will not operate in the chrysler corporation cd player as it immediately displays an error message and ejects the maxell lens cleaner disk it does function in the gm player however i have noticed that the chrysler cd player is finiky about playing some cd disks that always play on the gm unit it is obvious that my gm unit is superior to my chrysler unit but the fact remains the maxell disk will not function in my jeep s cd player 
don t waste your money don t waste your money on this i sent it back to amazon com for a complete refund and didn t pay a dime to return it it is defective to the max read the reviews it won t close it strongly stinks when i bought mine it was on sale for with a rebate of i paid no shipping because i have prime i did not appreciate being insulted with such an extremely low quality defective item so instead of going for the rebate which would have taken weeks to get my money back to make it a free item i immediately sent it back to amazon to get a refund if only amazon would offer a zero star option as many of it s customers have requested for years 
omg they suck omg i got these headphones and they suck i am not even kidding they are probably the worst headphones in the world and the worst headphones i ve had in my life first of all when you listen to music there is a loud hissssss noise in the backround second these don t even fit over your freakin ears haha also they are tooo bulky you can t do anything with them the sound quality is ok but if your looking for noise cancelling headphones i dont recommend these i recommend the sony fontopia headphones or the dollar sony noise cancelling headphones that are ear buds and not too bulky availible at brookstones now those are what you call great these panasonic earfones are just horrible compared to these it only takes out like a little of the noise but the sony dollar ones at brookstone takes out of the noise ! that s amazing it is probably why they are so expensive well i have to leave but this is my advice to you don t ever ever buy these headphones in your life they are horrible hope this helped 
totally frustrated i received this item and it proved to be defective i have returned the original item and amazon has been promising me that they would ship the replacement for over a month now but has failed to make any of their estimated ship dates right now i am looking for another source and about to cancel the order 
this system blows not in a good way do not buy this system for the money there are much better systems out there i bought this for my family room mainy for the small size of the cube speakers the main problem with the system which bose has corrected by the way is that the acoustimass component boses fancy name for a subwoofer is not active or powered which means the base is totally inadequate and is overun by the cubes which have no mid or bass ranges the result is that you get a very tinny sound out of most applications including dvd s i ended up getting a sony active subwoofer and it sounds much better in hindsight i would have bought a different brand than bose but already had to much invested in bose to scrap the system completely and the size of the cubes is nice still pissed that i spent that much money on a substandard system but hey got sucked into the bose marketing machine 
poor design there is something quite wrong with the laser mouse the shape is not right it s kind of shallow i have to be conscious every time i grab this mouse so that i don t to hit the side buttons all in all terrible 
don t buy this shredder if i d read the reviews here for fellowes shredders before buying one i would have stayed well clear as it was i needed a cross cutter saw this one pcm on sale and bought it it jammed on day it has jammed numerous times since although the capacity states pages you re better off shredding just a couple of pages at a time but be warned that they recommend the unit can only operate for min at a time due to shoddy engineering months after purchase a document caused it to jam resulting in the motor shearing the teeth off the internal nylon gears for an extra cents these could have been metal the other point is the wire basket which at first looks stylish but oozes paper dust and emptying is a struggle as the shredder jams into it this requires some effort to dislodge which causes you exert and bend the metal basket even more etc etc this shredder has now joined its own output the star is for the months of limited use i got out of it 
how rude can adorama be very ! got my new card and it didn t work so had to send it back so upon calling adorama every person i talked to was rude short and not helpful they did send me out a new one hopefully it will work i do know one thing i will never ever buy from adorama again beware rude people and lousy customer service at adorama i will return to tell you more on how my new card is working for me 
horrible do not purchase this item was a total bust sound quality is lousy reception is poor and you can barely hear your music come through it s cheaply made and is obvious once you see the package it comes in and the product itself i would return it but by time i paid return shipping i d only get a few dollars back not worth it in any way 
use caution with this item i have two of these things when used with a car lighter outlet they cause my legend cx to overheat when used with a true v power source they work fine most cars actually run at about to volts instead of garmin is trying hard to help me resolve this but in the meantime be aware that certain units may experience problems with this system 
loading paper i had to return it because it would never load the paper very poo 
not portable i bought this portable dvd player that bills itself as being the perfect solution for watching dvd s onthego unfortunately as of the time i purchased it the description fails to note that it must be plugged into a wall outlet or car power source thus it won t work on a plane and if you use it in a car you apparently have to run the cord up front to the power supply i think the name and description of this product is misleading the documentation states that you can buy a universal battery pack but that would increase the cost substantially to be fair the return process for the third party seller is going smoothly and after a bit of resistance they have also agreed to reimburse the shipping costs for this item 
very disapponted does not work etc i had previously purchased an hwud and love it ! this model never functioned properly and the software could not be completely removed from one of my desktops i will not purchase this model again 
poor print quality and failed drum unit i have used nec and samsung laser printers in the past but the writeups on this brother printer attracted me my experience after just a month of use is awful the print quality is mediocre seeming very gray in comparison with past printers and the print drum appears to have failed leaving streaks of print gaps on the page 
will not work properly with unsupported dvd media you pay almost twice the price that you pay for other dvd burners then you waste four or five dvd s before you find out by doing internet research that it will not burn unsupported dvd media at highest speed of course burning software should tell you that or adjust the burning speed for successful burn however that is too much to ask from free roxio software that plextor will give you it is bad engineering on plextor s part that they will even not bundle a single sheet of paper saying up front that what media the burner will support 
important info not mentioned in product details this player is useless if you own a macintosh you need the safely remove hardware wizard in windows to modify the charging status even if you purchase a power adapter sold separately you will not be able to use the software for your player also the buttons are too small for practical use and look cheaply made overall the player looks like a children s cell phone 
monitor problem we bought this unit for a day trip the picture is very clear better than most but right after that trip the second monitor lost its picture we sent it back to the manufacturer never received the item back and it s been about months stay away from this product ! 
just take a fullsize mouse it s worth it just to take a regular size optical mouse with you this one doesn t save that much space it works fine but it s not comfortable to use 
not worth it i bought mine at wal mart for followed the instructions with two scratched dvd s from the library one badly scratched the other still playable and saw almost no change in the scratches or playability it s going back in the morning this model relies on an aluminum oxide paste superfine liquid sandpaper to sand off the scratches i think i ll see better performance from one of the products that actually fills in the scratches rather than sanding down the rest of the disc for cleaning just get one of the inexpensive manual cleaners with the little bottle of denatured alcohol they work just fine 
worst phone ever these phones do not work they have a lot of static and the battery runs out quickly do not buy them 
westinghouse service is terrible bought a westinghouse lcd tv november of it arrived broken and i had to send it back after waiting for more than a month a refurbished unit arrived which was obviously used for a very long time the unit was scratched and looked very old i called westinghouse and said i paid for a new tv and want a new tv back westinghouse told me this is a standard procedure if something is broken they can sent you back a refurbished unit even if you have not used that tv for minute it is now february and i am still waiting for a replacement my advice do not buy anything from westinghouse 
do not buy this webcam i gave a one star to this item only because i couldn t give a lower rating than that the image quality is very very bad we decided to return it in just the first half hour we started using it it doesn t work properly with yahoo messenger and the image quality is very bad in skype 
poor product terrible support i constantly lose connection with this card while my other belkin card stays connected eventually i decided to get rid of this card and get another belkin funny thing happened ! the linksys card can t be uninstalled and it prevents the belkin card from being installed nothing happens after i run the uninstaller i had to call them they said they would send me a registry cleaner via email it never arrived even though they made repeated promises i had to make numerous calls and wait in long line to get connected i also had bad experiences with a linksys router i will never buy a linksys product update i called them again and again finally i was told there was in fact no such cleaner for this model 
irritating i have a mac i need an external hard drive where i can just drag my files on to the hard drive s icon eject the icon and be on my merry way this hard drive seems unable to do that or if it is the help section is painfully bare even if you re looking for a hard drive where you can set it up to automatically back up certain files with the touch of a button i wouldn t recommend this hard drive to mac users i happen to dislike the way pcs are set up i find the organization very anti intutive and that s a big part of my issue with this hard drive on my way out the door to return it right no 
such low quality for a high price first off this is not a case it is a pouch with a clear plastic front and draw strings at the top once in the case the controls are not that responsive because they are touchpads also it is such a tight fit that it is hard to get the player in and out of it and i feared scratching the display the fit is so tight that after about a week the stiching holding the clear plastic in place began to come apart and in about another week there was a noticeable hole between the stiching and the clear plastic very low quality for the price i love my creative zen micro photo but hate the fact that accessories are so limited for it 
joe barone big buyer cases very cheaply made break when opening not worth shipping cost waste of money 
very poor reception i bought this tv to pick up armed forces network signals at my base in iraq transmitted from on the base btw and all i get is a very poor picture and sound i can barely hear the reception is worthless in my opinion so i packaged it up and sent it to my son back home thanks axion i had to go out and buy a regular tv for which works perfectly with the enclosed rabbit ears 
sw won t run on all computers i have a fairly new computer fujitsu s laptop and this sw won t run on it it installs without any error clicking on the program icon results in nothing happening as a test i installed it on my desktop a cyberpowerpc and it runs just fine but i need it on my laptop not my desktop it doesn t do me any good while on the road to be running on my home machine i called tech support and they basically had me disable all the boot time software and services and yes the software does run but is that really a solution it s more like a kludge the software has issues and magellan doesn t want to admit it the magellan web site hints that version of directroute won t run on all dvd drives but they don t provide a solution i asked if they would upgrade me to version and they said no this software was essentially a waste of money for me 
horrible quality i was deeply disappointed for buying stuff from memorex not a single dvd was usable in the pack never gonna buy anything from memorex ! 
perfect for tunnels it s a super idea but i cannot say it works well getting a free station is a real challenge even in the underdeveloped italy and if you get one but you are driving within minutes or miles you lose the signal however the sound is perfect when you enter into a tunnel is not good for cars but works at home connecting it to the radio it needs to be improved 
just nothing this amazing booster did nothing to my signal i have tried everything and nothing 
looks pretty in the picture would of been great to receive so i could of gotten some use of i 
too complicated small for us we ordered this case auto mount for our philips pet widescreen portable dvd player because it was the one recommended by amazon i needed the auto mount for long car rides with my toddler i eventually got this thing to work failure was not an option if you get my drift but it has a number of drawbacks in order to mount it you have to remove the top half huh having two parts makes it harder to install and easier to lose i accidentally left the top part on the top of the car when i drove away its too small the philips portable dvd player is too long for the case and the headphones and car ac converters also pull the player out of the case plus and this is really amazing it does not have enough space to hold the most basic accessories that came with the dvd player i have to carry the headphones and sleaved dvds seperately i chose my last dvd player b c it came with an auto mount case and even though i like the philips dvd player i d do that again if i had it to do over having the right case mount for your dvd player is that key 
very uncomfortable the sound quality of these headphones is ok there was a pretty constant buzz or hum in the background i like the feature of using regular batteries no dying and waiting for them to recharge the headphones are very uncomfortable ! the self adjusting strap is constantly pushing down on my head and pulling up on my ears i couldn t wear them for very long without them giving me a headache 
how did this thing earn the top spot at ilounge i tried and tried to convince myself that this sounded good or even acceptable alas the sound was so muddy no matter what i did i set the eq on treble boost and i pressed the d button on the unit still as muddy and muffled as could be besides that there was a terrible sound between tracks that reminded me of a cd player searching for the next track amazingly i never hear this sound when using the nano with headphones i am returning this and moving up another price point when searching for my next small speaker set 
wrong cd changer it didn t match the acoustic wave player i bought there should have been also two outdoor speakers as a promotion for buying both pieces the page from which i ordered both pieces was unclear and i received the cd player with the wrong cd changer i had to return the changer and buy the one that matched the player i know i ll be refunded the price of the first changer but by then the promotion they were having for the outdoor speakers had finished i received the real changer a few days later but lost the speakers i think amazon owes me the speakers which is what the bad page made me miss 
cool device but connectivity problems i bought the archos mostly for the picture and video viewing and sharing ability the large screen and good portability seemed ideal to share photos and videos with friends and family the device didn t disappoint also has coolness factor going for it with the sleek design and easy navigation my opinion quickly changed when i ran into connectivity problems a few days into using it while i was able to download and synchronize via windows media player easily the first couple of times the device all of a sudden wasn t recognized as a usb device anymore and also froze the external hardware management function on my pc right now i cannot even connect using it simply as an external hard drive and so far customer service at archos has not been able to help me blaming the problem on driver issues on my pc seems to defy logic works fine first and then without warning stops a really frustrating experience seems like this is along the lines of problems that another reviewer experienced so this may not be as isolated as i thought 
yes worst product ever i wish i read the reviews before i bought this thing unfortunately extremely user unfriendly to connect and disconnects itself often kills batteries even in sleep mode the size and precision is good when it does work but definitely not worth the money i exchanged it for a new one thinking it was just the first unit but still terrible 
maybe a night light i ordered this item thinking that it would be useful when on the road in hotel rooms to light up my work area wrong the light is so dim the only thing it might be good for is a night light ! this lamp is a good idea but much too weak to be of any help 
caution device may be responsible for phone line noise in retrospect i am not sure how well this worked as another reviewer stated below after a couple of years when using my cordless phone i started to hear static then eventually i heard a very loud annoying pulse tone which the person i called also heard assuming the line noise was due to my phone dsl line i called my telephone service provider to check the line i was thinking of changing my dsl line filters or buying a new phone assuming some problem with my panasonic ghz phone when i figured out this device was responsible the zapper went immediately into the garbage not sure what started the problems bad battery latent defect in the end am not sure how effective this device is as i still received plenty of unsolicited calls in any case this device was not worth the trouble and cost 
looks good but the case looks great and fits well but it s nearly impossible to remove i had to insert a credit card between the latches and pry for a long time i was afraid of hurting both the case and the ipod in addition it s too wide in the case to dock in my logitech speaker system i might have considered keeping it if i could have just snapped the case off for docking 
didn t work for me midi uno yamaha keyboard buy the ux simple mat 
back ups es drops power after power is restored most people buy a ups plug it in and never test it to make sure it works i tested this device a number of times to make sure the software would at least shutdown the computer after an outage i set it to shutdown windows after minute only the computer and a few small phone accessories are attached to it after power was cut it held the computer up and allowed it to shut down then i restored power to the ups after about seconds it beeped clicked and temporarily dropped power to the computer while it was rebooting ! so when it switches back from battery power it causes power to be interrupted that is unacceptable a ups should never drop power to the attached devices after power is restored to it 
same i had the same problem as the st poster very dissapointing and quite aggrivating because i really needed this yesterda 
check w the manufacturer check that this fits your plasma or lcd before you buy it s not so universal as they say it didn t fit my philips pfa plasma check ! i can t stress that enough eri 
warning i had no problems burning to these discs its when i went back a few months later to these discs and found out that none of them work anymore after further research i found out that memorex uses the cheapest dye available and thus the dvds have absolutelly no life to them my discs started dying after a few months in addition in you physically hold the disc in your hands you can feel how warped physically it has become this is true for all the discs about of them i can not not recommend this product stronly enough 
buyer beware i purchased the crosley cr in brushed chrome in february less than a year later it s inoperable and way out of crosley s day warranty compared to the s western electric manufactured phone that crosley modeled their product from the western electric product lasted for years 
worthless bought this player to amuse a year old on a plane ride worked the whole trip just fine got home just stopped working gives the error of wrong disk when trying to play a dvd i know works fine all of the disk play was supervised by me so i know it was nothing the kid did i then looked up the web site to send in for repairs found out it would cost almost to fix ! that s almost the cost of the player itself what a scam sell an inferior product and expect the consumer to fork over repair costs or buy an new one well not me go to a different brand 
don t buy this product this player is junk it would not play music for more than two hours before going dead when i called toshiba the person that i talked to claimed he wasn t aware battery life was even a problem i directed him to read some of the reviews on c net which i discovered after i bought it my fault it was finally returned and the battery was replaced now after two weeks it won t even hold a charge i m returning it and will not recommend this to anyone 
it s just ok i was excited when i saw the price because i d been looking for a cheap cordless that had an answering machine i love the answering machine and the features that come with it my problem is with the headset it is very hard to hear the person on the other end i have to have the volume all the way up but then i have to talk softly because i ll hear myself yelling and can barely hear the person on the other end i have to be in a quiet room with no kids tv or dogs to hear and use this phone and most of the time that just isn t possible 
leaked in my grundig radio what a mess i got sucked into this deal about a year ago and can say long term risky cells it could be because the clock draws even when the radio part is off but i mnot willing to chance it again 
connections are too tight ! what happened to monster quality control what has happened to monster s quality in i had a discount on monster cable through my employer and purchased close to retail prices worth of their cables for wiring up my home theater i have been using the gamelink with s video for my ps and that works great here it is years later and i buy these gamelink for use with my new hdtv with component inputs when i tried to install them i thought i was going to snap the connections off my tv because of the amount of force i had to exert with much determination i got them to connect i switched on the ps and experienced no video just sound i had even a harder time removing them when comparing these cables to my older s video gamelinks the differences are the new wires are lighter rigid and the connectors are definately too small in diameter in hand they feel cheaper compared to the heavier more pliable older wires i will no longer buy monster cables and i do not recommend these to anyone audioquest is much better too bad they don t make gaming cables 
worst purchase i have ever made i bought mintek dvd players because i got such a great deal at kohl s department store i ended up getting each one for about which was a great price compared to the original price within the first months i had the same spinning of the disk and no disk message come up when there was a disk in it i immediately returned the one to kohl s i kept the other one to my dismay i had a hunch i should of returned it sure enough after the day warranty it began having the exact same problems definitely a mintek problem i have emailed made phone calls several times with absolutely no human contact or response this company needs to be reported because they sell junk and back it up with absolutely nothing i figured i was already out a bunch of money i just wanted to get it fixed so it was usuable cant reach anyone to do that there is a reason you can t find anyone they know their products are worthless don t buy anything from mintek worst mistake you will ever make and take a lot of your money with it 
great if it will turn on i took the tv out of the box plugged it in and nothing after pushing the on off switch repeatedly it finally came on picture and sound were terrific so i was very pleased turned it off with the remote of course the tv wouldn t turn on again with either the remote or the switch pushed the switch about times and it finally came on i called panasonic customer service who could not do anything to fix it by phone so now my new tv is in for a warranty repair less than hours after i received it talk about frustrating ! 
never got it kensinton is a good product name but is worthless if the supplier is out of stock that is why the star ritzcamera was the supplyier 
does not do the job the product is a four usb hub however for usb flash drives which is what i got it for it does not work you can put one drive in the top row and one in the bottom if you try to put them side byside they do not fit the ports are too close together so in fact functionally it is not really a four usb hub but only a tow usb hub for the price of four 
if they would send you the right card i am not the first person to have this problem what i received was in fact a wintv hvr which is not at all the same as a wintv pvr because it does not have linux drivers then i had to go to the trouble of calling haupauge to get them to switch it out had to pay shipping to send them the more than a week went by before i was able to build my mythtv box 
windows media player incompatibility incredibly frustrating i was quite happy with my t until i recently upgraded my windows media player to version it became impossible to add any new music there is a firmware upgrade on the iriver website which i downloaded and installed three times it just doesn t work ! i managed to solve this problem only by rolling back to wmp btw i emailed iriver customer support about this problem and waited days for a response 
my roommate s broke then mine broke my roommate s mouse broke she had the older l shaped receiver and i thought it was because she s bad with technology but i m a computer junkie who knows how to take care of her technical equipment and even mine broke a few months later i had a straight receiver it just gave up on me not a battery issue more like a connection issue now i read all these reviews about it breaking on people well i ll write back when my other roommate s break and when my cousin s break dont get me wrong but it was great while it lasted less than half a year gonna go back to my logitech that never broke on me 
not for everyone must have firewire ac wall charger and or six pin firewire on computer to charge this unit i have neither also found g vidpod didn t fit properly in plastic sleeves and the dock connector seemed to want to unseat it as well returned unit to shop and purchased belkin x aa battery unit with suction cups much better you can use rechargeable batteries or simply buy them when needed 
obviously not mac compatible great disappointment plugged in this equipment and tried typing in all the applications i own excel word freehand among others and displayed typed numbers when it did with extra spaces and squared characters should specify in the product description that is not mac compatible i m not aware if pc users faced this problem as well 
inefficiency i ordered several ink cartridges at one time and was appalled when i received a slew of large boxes to deliver my order the increased cost of shipping the cartridges separately made one magenta cartridge go from to all the cartrides arrived within a day of each other i would rather pay for one shipment rather than separate ones 
monster cable is misleading research before making a purchase first of all the cable is very difficult to install it s rigid and not flexible after i connected my cable box and my lcd hdtv with this monster cable hdmi my service provider time warner cable told me that they don t support hdmi i should use the component cable that comes with the cable box well i already opend the box and it s too late to return every now and then i get a message on my tv saying you can not use hdmi cale please use the component cable to watch tv i had to turn my tv off and on to get rid of that screen some hd channels volumes are very low i have to turn to the loudest in order to listen has it anything to do with the cable time warner won t care the sales guys from circuit city said it s must to get bla bla bla in order to watch best high definition channels this hdmi cable is one of the recommendations i m too naive to trust them i should have researched more before making a purchase i don t like the cable at all sooner it ll destroy either port the cable or the tv 
beware this tricky little backwards baby i must say that i had to return my atdec wall mount cuz it s made in a cut corner way that should be rejected vesa measurements are mm or mm and usually mm we would be using this atdec wall mount has one piece mm but the second part is only mm so it has the smaller mm screw ins on my lcd pc monitors the monitors had mm screw fittings so i was forced to put the mm piece of the mount afixed to the wall this made the piece on the wall set in w small distance between screws ifelt unsure and after turning my wall mounted monitor on off a few times the wall mount mm piece started to loosen don t buy this mount peerless is a far better unit to get for yourself 
was not needed based on my research for the logitech harmony remote i thought i needed the extender that is not the case the extender comes with the remote the return process was a nightmare because of amazon s third party retailers beware when purchasing throught the third party retailers the rules of return and customer satisfaction change ! eventually amazon resolved all issues but it didn t happen in their normally easy manner 
half of this never worked i decided to risk the purchase based on previous reviews i got it and it seemed like it would be fine the vcr portion worked beautifully audio and video the dvd portion s audio was fine but the video never worked all i saw was jagged lines across the screen would not recommend this product 
bought two and both stopped working this is such a cute toy and my daughter was having a great time with it a couple of days and then the cd player just stopped reading the cd took it back and the same thing happen ! i can t believe they allow this thing to stay on the shelves im going to go with the spongebob karaoke which is made by emerson at least a brand i ve heard of 
doesn t work on windows vista tried this with two different computers using windows vista got this message one of the usb devices attached to this computer has malfunctioned and windows does not recognize it the mini disk that came with it was no help no response from tiger direct went to radio shack and got one it works 
bad bad bad i had this product less than a week when it failed to play any dvds the tv is ok but over all not worth it 
don t buy i am in the process of my nd return the cd player is junk our radio worked but am very frustrated i cannot believe that ge would put ther name on such a piece of trash 
dead after a few months as with some of the other reviewers mine stopped working and blew the fuse in my car for the cigarette lighter i bought a vector brand inverter at wal mart and it is much better 
not worth the extra money for lightscribe it really isn t worth the extra money to pay for lightscribe cds when you do use lightscribe it does even look good it is very faint and the writing is very small just use a label instead 
lots of static the phone has too much static unless you re sitting right next to the console in which case you might has well have a corded phone 
beautiful picture poor quality control i bought my first samsung hls w on march from one of the well know big box stores i chose this model because its picture was far superior to any of the other models in its price range i took a chance however and bought returned open box tv saving a few hundred bucks in the process the salesman assured me that the set had been gone over thoroughly before it was put back on sale when the television was delivered the picture was stunning and i was very pleased with my purchase after a few days however the picture arbitrarily began switching from to aspect ratio this would happen every half hour to minutes not a big deal but annoying to say the least instead of returning the set under the store s day return policy i had them send a service technician out to see what could be done he scratched his head and said he d have to do a little research and would get back to me in a day or so about a week later with no further contact with the technician the set developed a new problem it would cut off every once in a while at that point i had had enough of this dog and sent it back to the store however i wasn t ready to give up on samsung and their bright and beautiful dlp picture i paid the extra bucks and had a brand new right out of the sealed box hls w delivered the new tv had been in my house for less than two hours when it lost sound i checked all connections and determined that it was a problem in the tv an hour or so later i turned the set back on and everything was fine i watched it for about an hour thinking all was well when the sound failed again i returned to the store that night and told them my sad tale the salesperson told me that they had indeed had several of these samsung models returned for various problems he said they seemed to be having major quality control problems i told him to come get the tv i took a chance the first time on an open box model and got burned i chalked it up to the old adage that you get what you pay for the second time around i took no chances and paid full price for a brand new version of the tv but still no luck not being a complete fool my third was not a samsung it s a shame that a tv with such a beautiful picture has to be done in by poor quality control 
belkin s cable the ends are comming off this cable doesn t meet the normal belkin standards 
another example of marketing hype designed to lift money from the wallets of the american public if one is to transmit digital signals like those that come from the back of dvd and cd players reliably shielding is a basic requirement this cable is not shielded look for foil in addition to the copper braid further digital signals don t care about super low resitance or impedance if the bits get there the amplitude is incidental once a sufficient level is achieved over a distance of gtfeet big and fat are just to make you feel good about spending on a piece of hardware see below for a possible exception to this thirdly if you don t have balanced electronics what difference could an unbalanced cable with rca interconnects make rca connectors will never be ohm connectors they will never be balanced the arrows are mostly to make you feel good about your purchase usually it simply indicates the company specs that any drains are attatched at the end to which the arrows point if you have such a grounding problem as to cause interference in your playback an rca will never cure anything as a feel good genuflection to the audiphile gods attach all your arrowed interconnects with the arrow pointing the same way and lastly look into vswr and how the design of this rca affects it the large diameter of this cable and therefore the diameter of it s dielectric might help here but if you can see the solder job the chance of unhealthy levels of vswr is greater in that once the signal reaches this rca the differences between the rca s shielding and other properties and the properties of the coaxial cable are sudden and definite if you have the money to spend and like to massage your cables as you install them this company makes some nice looking feeling stuff not surprising in the world of audio big marketing hype over substance 
loves to eat paper i ve had this scanner for months now it worked ok the first month but since then it loves to eat paper it scans multiple pages at once for example a page document becomes pages one scanned i have to scan the same document multiple times sometimes up to times until the scanner finaly scans each page it gets to be very frustrating actually it s the worse piece of office equipment i ever purchased otherwise it works fine 
very disappointed i purchased rite lites to use under my kitchen cabinets the light output was not strong enough to assist in food prep or even read a recipe additionally the batteries were drained very quickly so i would have to be replacing batteries all the time i called the company to see if i could return them and was told no if i didn t have the original packaging even though i had the invoice i was very disappointed to have worth of merchandise that i couldn t use or return 
what a piece of junk i have many cameras network and otherwise ptz and fixed and this is by far the worst one it has difficulty focusing it s noisy doesn t hold presets well and the image appears to start melting every few seconds then snaps back to clear the wireless connection is pretty reliable but that s about all i can count on the api support for this thing is nil along with the options they give you tech support is usually no help at all i just purchased an axis ptz and it completely blows this thing out of the water no more dlink for me 
poor reception i bought this at compusa i live in rural vermont the autosearch works fairly well the static when connected is acceptable a big problem is that suddenly you ll get blasted by static when the fm signal is interfered with i m bringing it back for refund i agree with the previous reviewer it s not worth it my wife s old station monster works much better im going to try going back to my old belkin charge which connects to a cassette 
awful the fan is so weak it makes the product useless it may be able to cool a small flea perhaps an ant maybe a centimenter of human skin don t waste your money 
noisy blower after about weeks of operation the fan clicks and buzzes like crazy looking for a better option 
same problem as others sticks to glass then won t stick i bought my wife a nuvi for her birthday last august overall we love the nuvi but the mount no the biggest advantage of the nuvi over other gps systems is its portability unfortunately the suction cup appears to have been designed to subvert this feature the cup sticks to the first window it is attached to very well and then won t let go when we tried to transfer it after being attached only a couple of days it left pieces of itself to the windshield and was very difficult to reattach to another windshield though with difficulty and repeated tries we have been able to move it what this means is that you need a mount for each car you want to use this in the mount and the charging power wire which you will also need since it is cumbersome to remove from the mount are pretty darn expensive which is ridiculous for a portable system 
do not buy i made the mistake of ordering one of these i took it out of the box and laminated one page that came out with a bent corner luckily it wasn t an important document or anything so i printed another page and tried to laminate it the machine would not feed at all i called the manufacturer who stated i would need to mail it in at my expense and they would take a week or two to fix it so i exchanged it instead on amazon and got a new one it worked for about three weeks still often have problems with corners being bent and then it got stuck with a page half way through needless to say don t waste your time and money getting aggravated with this machine it s too late for me to return this to amazon so i m basically throwing this away and buying a real laminating machine 
this product doesn t work i bought a netgear wgt wireless card to replace one from another manufacturer that had failed first i coudln t get a connection to the router two conversations with tech support in india produced the information that i had to download a new driver for windows xp sp from the internet i installed the new driver which allowed me to connect to the router but not reliably to the internet a third attempt with tech support produced the suggestion that i change my web browser im using ie instead i bought a linksys card which worked straight out of the box don t buy this product ! if you re not convinced go to the netgear user forum and read the horror stories there 
doesnt last for long i regret buying this product since day u have to reboot it again and again and now atlast after months only it died on me 
received bad service amazon fail to deliver item within a reasonable time the item fail to arrive and therefore we never received the good 
junk didn t work with my multi function then died a little over a year later this was my first and only purchase of a linksys product i unhappily discovered that it would not work with my multifunction printer then hooked it up to another printer only to have it die just out of warranty a completely worthless piece of chinese made technology that is so bad the manufacturer doesn t even stand behind it 
apple ir remote for ipod video th gen the deficiencies of this remote with the new ipod video th gen are serious in order to use this remote you must have or purchase the universal dock for an additional not only is its capability seriously flawed eg the menu button is non functional with the ipod you can only adjust volume go forward go back pause and resume play when using it for slideshows and videos you must do all of the pre show set ups first using the photo settings or video settings menus directly on the ipod and even start the slideshow or video then and only then can you assume limited control with the remote but if you inadvertently push the remote s play pause button at the beginning of the show the ipod will revert to the music playlist function and you will have your slideshow playing not with the music you selected in the set up but with the music from the music menu playlist last selected the only recourse is to go to the ipod and reprogram the photo or video settings and restart the show from the beginning once the last picture is seen you must then go back to the ipod to stop the show otherwise the music will continue to play and the show will loop and restart not only is this a poor purchase choice at any price it is the only solution because the ultimate problem lies with the ipod software which can provide no additional functions no matter what brand of remote you buy this is a problem that only apple can fix 
not as great as it sounds if you re planning on using this much as a radio think again the reception on trains over land is terrible the reception at work in an interior office is worse xm customer service will tell you that you have to sit next to a south facing window for optimal reception as an mp player it s okay as long as you don t have a vast itunes library it doesn t work with itunes at all and the software that samsung provides is for pc only just my opinion 
nice features but poor display and reception a terrific idea show the current time and the alarm times all at once very intuitive very helpful unfortunately the backlit lcd display just doesn t make the grade the numbers do not stand out against the bright background enough to be easily readable the manufacturer s photo makes the numbers look sharp and clear but the customer image from wickedpete is much more realistic the numbers just wash out its interesting that the customer image shows the orange and green backlights reversed from the manufacturer s image and from the unit i got i think that would be a slight improvement because on the one i got the orange backlighting the alarm times is about twice as bright as the green backlighting the current time and it just looks weird also fm radio reception is quite poor the line cord is supposed to serve as the antenna but that just doesn t work well no matter how i orient the cord i can t tune in a strong station just miles away so back it goes 
i just paid for sparkly frisbees from amazon this just don t make no motha since at less than a dollar per sparkly frisbee this is the best price i can find for frisbees they don t fly very well and they break relatively easily but this is the best value i can find for frisbees in one place a lot of people are disappointed because they expect to be able to use these discs as writable cd media the problem with that is they don t work very well for that either i too tested this for myself using nero burning rom i tried many times to burn different kinds of data onto several of the discs at x just like you re supposed to it worked ! it burned fine then it took minutes to open a simple html document on the burned disc subsequent trials run with the verify written data checkbox checked revealed that every other sector or so was unreadable after burning it s like writing with a white crayon except this is white paper this persisted on several other computers with different cd burner drives and even different software i finally realized what great frisbees these things are cheer up people they are great fun ! so grab your spindle go outside and start chucking these things at your neighbor s annoying dog ps i need to sue memorex for selling this junk these disc are just a form of abuse 
the worst device i ve ever seen if you can make it work or if you are lucky to get a non defective unit it can only read card at a timeneeds specific usb power requirements needs the usb power be v and not vsb else you will get usb hub power exceeded errors the worst part is that the mainboard i tested is v and still didn t workthe cards inserted on the lower card slots have to be inserted upside downfrom time to time you can get the message usb device not recognized contacted support service there average not so good support forum has several topics complaining about this product couldnt get a replacement since days tigerdirect warranty have expired can t send the unit to ultra because currently i m outside the us and as i stated customer service is not good bottom linedon t buy this item 
great while it lasted i bought this mouse eight months ago and was quite satisfied until last week when it stopped functioning altogether i really expected a better product and durability from microsoft i ve since bought a logitech vx revolution cordless laser mouse for notebooks and love it 
not enough info given this product is only approved for casio keyboards and only like three of those wish i would have known before hand 
extends but doesn t pick up ip numbers when it works it does extend the range however every time you turn off a wirelessly connected pc and turn it on again the pc is not assigned an ip number unplug this extender and the pc is assigned an ip number by the router without any problem a brief power blackout will cut ip numbers to your wirelessly connected pcs i purchased this particular d link range extender because i wanted to ensure that it works well with my di router i wasted my money buying this device it s useless and it s too light to even serve as a door stop 
playing by garmin s rules if you purchase a garmin product especially this one you are firmly in the clutches of a company that gives you what they want you to have not what you might want everything garmin makes is proprietary so that nothing else will work on a garmin you will be unable to transfer data to garmin media you will be insulted by a website either written by or for aliens and should you call the customer service or cartography lines assuming you wish to wait and wait you will get to talk to people so uninformed about garmin products your wait was wasted the dingus works ok with garmin chips but the chips are inadequate or incomplete if you should have a mac garmin leaves you totally unsupported so that if you choose a garmin you need to buy a pc a downloader and garmin chips to go with garmin s vastly overpriced cds in short if you prefer unsupported products that are designed to force you to buy from a company indifferent to their customers garmin should be at the top of your list with their gpsmap c 
not so happy i bought this product thinking a sony drive should be a good one right wrong the drive claims to be x but even with high quality expensive media i couldn t get the drive to burn any faster than x to make things worse i was looking forward to the fast cd read speed so i could copy music to my ipod it turns out itunes will not play cd s from this drive i can use winamp musicmatch and windows media player to play cd s from this drive but not itunes what a disappointing product 
save your money it s a nice look but it tips over very easily it is not steady on a rug surface dispite what the picture on the box shows my advice is if you need a cd rack that holds a lot of cd s save your money and invest in something nicer and more sturdy 
runs hot short life i installed this power supply as a replacement from gateway from the moment i installed it it did not cool sufficiently within a year it had failed completely 
far too uncomfortable i m a gamer i play for hours a day and currently use a simple ms intellimouse optical well i was looking for something a little more pro and in my searching i saw the razer line of gaming mice i uncharacteristly ordered one based on the specs without trying one out only to find that it is far too bulky and uncomfortable to play with its got large rubber triming down each side so it is cumbersome to get to the left side buttons i only say the left side because the right side buttons are so miserably place you will never ever be able to reach them during game play it also feels too long and flat so the scroll wheel is note easily reached and your hand does not rest comfortably yeah it looks great and i m sure it s doing an amazing job a moving precisely however i can t get it to move correctly in my hand due to its horrible shape so for gaming it s rather worthless 
memory card error my review mirrors of this product mirrors that of another customer posted recently for some months after i first bought the card it worked great now it has twice caused memroy card errors and corrupted data with my canon elph and photo technicians have been unable to retrieve any of the pictures from the card judging by what other customers have written i m suspecting that this may be an issue of poor compatibility between canon cameras and viking cards in any case i will be buying a new memory card and it will certainly not be a viking 
on off it is the year the st century we ve put men on the moon we ve launched space probes to the edges of our solar system we can even remotely drive little vehicles along the surfaces of other planets but we can t design a simply on off button the on off button for the blue logger is one of the most insanely stupid things i ve ever encountered some mentally challenged engineer somewhere decided that you have to hold the button seconds to turn it on and seconds to turn it off it doesn t sound that difficult to do but in practice it is infuriating especially when you are trying to turn it on but end up turning it off right now the blue logger is sitting in front of me and i cannot turn it off it simply will not turn off oh and i ve had lots of problems connecting it to my bluetooth adapter and have yet to get street atlas usa to recognize it 
pilfered shipment damaged the container of dvds had been cut open apparently before packaging for shipment over twenty discs were missing and the remainder were covered with dust and debris the discs were packed loosely and rolled freely inside the box amazon sent me a label to print out for return shipping of the box for a refund but it s been a week and a half since i mailed it back and i have yet to receive acknowledgement 
not quite there yet i purchased this yoke thinking that i would get a better flight experience with msfs but the responsivness of the yoke is terrible i had an older version from several years ago and it had the same problems i was hoping that they had improved their product but it is basically the same yoke that they had years ago with a couple of extra buttons aded they need to develop a better slide mechanism so that there is a smooth transition when climbing or decending there is way too much friction between the stick and the collar of the housing you often need to overcompensate with a sudden push to overcome the friction which makes the plane hard to control it is very hard to get the yoke to center so you are always having to make adjustments beyond what you can do with elevator trim but this is pretty much the only reasonably priced yoke on the market so i wouldnt hold my breath on them revising the design to make this into a quality product i would not recommend this yoke for anyone wishing to get a true flying experience i wish saitek would make a yoke with the same quality that they put into their rudder pedals but for some reason they have stayed out of the yoke market 
a worthless piece of junk not worth one star ! lasted about week and then started emitting a high pitched whine loud enough to wake people in the next town it is now officially dead and useless even the short while it worked it was almost useless switching speed and mouse response was frankly terrible the keyboard lagged several characters behind my typing and fitting the cables into it was simply not possible do not buy this don t even think about it 
the worst dvds i have tried so far i have used three other brands of x dvd rs and none of them have been problematic with my new tivo dvd burner this is the first brand that just hasn t worked these discs were a waste of time shopping for they were a waste of time dealing with failed burns and they were a waste of money i am not even going to attempt to sell the unopened package in the amazon marketplace since it wouldn t be fair to other buyers for your information i have had no problem with sony fuji and verbatim 
great concept poor execution this is a wonderful idea but is apparently before its time or the product designers didn t check with with the paper manufacturers it is easy to train the system to interpret bad handwriting but accomplishing that it is impossible to find replacement paper pads the only replacement pads i have been able to find are steno pads and these don t have the same page space productivity as the original paper which comes with the acecad either make replacement pads available or make the writing surface a different size to conform to writing pads that are more readily available 
mac book pro i was expecting at least a degree worth of difference it did not help at all absolute waste of dollars 
nah you can get a pack of emerging power mah batteries for on this very site i did they work great why would anyone pay almost bucks just for the batteries ridiculous 
nice case but this is a nice case and looks like it would do the job of protecting my ipod but it basically renders my speaker set useless the ipod won t dock now in the speaker s dock because of the case and it is way too tough to get the case on and off to be practical something has to give 
far too overpriced for this length you shouldn t spend more than much like the previous reviewer i urge you not to spend lots of money on hdmi cables hdmi specs state that only one pixel out of every billion can be lost therefore there is no reason no matter what the cable is made of to spend money on hdmi cables search the internet you can find plenty of good ft hdmi cables for or less digital is zeroes and ones in hdmi s case either the cable is connected or it isn t 
recommend model urc customer service at one for all was excellent but this model cannot be upgraded by phone they recommend urc which is only slightly more expensive i would recommend that model this did not have the codes i needed to program for tv or dvd player
