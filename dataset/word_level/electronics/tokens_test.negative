good when it works i bought this item not to cool my laptop but to provide some insulation from the heat when it s on my lap sitting in a chair i m very satisfied with it s being able to accomplish that however the cord ended up breaking after a few months targus replaced it at no charge which is good but still a hassle now one of the two fans has started making a racket when i first turn it on after a bit it settles down but very noisy at first 
you get what you pay for expecting big sound and good fm station reception buy something els 
wont work on a tungsten either for some reason the game controls dont work on my tungsten would have been cool but since there is no support for the game i guess it will have to get returned 
awful the fidelity is not very good i din t expect all that much but the real problem is that the cord is too long to work well with an ipod the cord tangles like crazy and the offset lengths to accomodate the volume control make the headset clumsy i just quit using the headphones in favor of the stock ipod ones 
nuulooq not so hot i bought this item with great expectations but was disappointed enough to return it today one big caveat on performance however i am running an older single processor mac g which although i use it in a professional graphics capacity every day photoshop is a bit pokey by todays standards after downloading tiger which is required for the tooldail app i got the thing going this is what i found evan after setting all the tooldial prefs to the fastest speed i got slow and jerky navigation w the nav ring overshooting the area i wanted to see because of a delayed response also to pan upwards on the page requires reaching over the top of this inch tall device to press with a firm pressure on the far side of the ring which requires a repositioning of the entire hand poor ergonomiics in my opinion seems like they went for a sexy look concept instead an ipod type dialing motion is fine on an ipod but on this device took many rapid circles on top of the tooldial to effect much change in brush size etc and seemed much less sensitive and intuitive than a rub strip on a music synthisizer or a waacom pressure pad the trigger points funtion but require surprisingly heavy pressure to operate at least to times the pressure of a mouse click this kind of treatment hours a day would send my aging wrists to the glue factory within a week there may be a device out there that will someday revolutionize my workflow but this isnt it back it goes 
not even i haven t enjoyed the boom box because the antenna couldn t find a signal after moving it to every possible south facing setting to send to the boom box i used this xm receiver in one of my trucks and it worked fine not the case with the indoor set up 
waste of money i just ran my first and last cd through the scratch repair system and it made the disk look worse than when i started didn t take off any of the scratches and the scratch remover actually made dozens of perpendicular marks of its own it really is worse than when i started 
glitchy software and more very important the software supplied converts your mp wma files to an alltrac format only usable on your computer and your sony netmd i think they do this for copyright purposes but what if your mp files are ones you recorded in a studio yourself i do not recommend this product as the software railroads you into buying from their site connectcom in alltrac format which is the only format the netmd players play thats right it does not play mp it does not play wma files it only plays files converted into alltrac form ! 
no stars for this non big button phone when they advertised big button i believed that they meant it but this is not i repeat not a big button phone if you are buying for a visully impaired person or even just because you don t see as well as you used to you re making a mistake 
worked fine for a month i bought these as a birthday present to myself to replace a set of well used monsoons which finally bit the dust i m not a gamer or an audiophile so i thought these were just fine for what i wanted decent sounding small enough to fit on my desk and a name brand and they were all that for a month i used them before bed one night and the next afternoon i went to use them and there was nothing but a loud buzzing coming out of the left speaker i fiddled with all the cables and connections nothing but buzz i turned everything off on still nothing but buzz the right speaker seemed to work just fine in frustration i turned off everything til the next day fired it all back up and the buzz was still there thankfully i had kept the receipt and packing material and returned it within the day time limit i had the opportunity to upgrade them for the newer bose companion set and i chose to go with a logitech system with small speakers and a subwoofer i can hide under my desk in the month i d had these bose i d decided that i was really still a kid at heart and i missed the thumpa thumpa of my monsoon subwoofer i never got that from the companion system 
does not fit nuvi or although marketed by amazon to fit the garmin nuvi it does not ! wrong fitting i ve decided to just charge my nuvi from the car with the dc cable that came with it the same way i frequently charge my cell phone 
i want my money back and a new cd this junk absolutley ruined an otherwise mildy scratched cd avoid at all costs unless you want to completely destroy a cd what was in that bottle toilet cleaner 
lovely sound horrible build quality i bought a pair in january and loved them sound is as lovely as everyone describes however there are something seriously lacking in the build quality the soft wires felt flimsy to me when i first opened it but i thought i d just take extra care at month of careful usage the plastic covered wires from earbuds downwards became so weather hardened that i could almost use them as chopsticks and makes it so the earbuds popped out at the slightest motion at months of careful usage the wires had half ripped from the plug which i repaired the best i could with unsightly electrical tape however at rd month the left bud fell completely off i am very disappointed it is one of the best sounding phones i ve ever had ive owned both grado s and s and sennheisers but man they need to do something about making this baby last 
tried hard to like it the software is terrible slow and glitchy i have to start and close it multiple times to get it to find the player the operators manual is just under pages so have fun learning the intricacies of the controls granted the hardware is cute and the variety of functions is impressive assuming you have sufficient spare time to study the manual 
screws aren t included you would think that when you buy a bracket of any sort the package would include the mounting screws well this doesn t and you aren t made of aware of that until you open the box i m a strong advocate of linksys products but this falls under the category of quotscrew the customer quot 
ge b spacemaker cd radio is junk i rate this i bought the ge cd radio to replace an older model ge a the cd player crapped out on the older model i have a ge kitchen and was some what happy with the older model the ge is difficult to adjust the volume the cd player skipped at the slightest disturbance in the room and i was totally not happy with its performance or sound quality do not waste your money there are better products out the only good point with the ge spacemaker under cabinet mount cd radio is the light i will mount the ge in the garage and use it as a night lighti replaced the ge with a sony fm am cd kitchen clock radio ifc cd the sony sounds awesome it rocks does not skip even with the volume all the way up is easy to operate can easily turn volume up and down can turn bass on and off i could never find a way to turn the bass off on the ge the sony has no light but i can live without the extra light i will never buy another ge cd radio for the kitchen 
when it works it s the best available tape adapter but i ve read many of the reviews of the sorely disappointed and i understand their complaints since i ve also experienced many of the same problems there are however some workarounds that might help some of the stuckees regarding too highgain leading to static i ve learned through trial and error that the not sosmartdeck volume is fairly random due to variations in mechanical position of its head relative to the tape deck head if the volume is set too high or low try plugging the smartdeck in and out a few times or reach your finger in and see if you can jiggle its position picking an especially loud song while you do this will help you to know when you have successfully adjusted to a good volume unfortunately this workaround doesn t work for all ipods although i can always successfully find a good position with my th generation gb ipod i ve noticed that the output from the ipod mini is significantly louder and therefore much harder to adjust this way regarding the tapedeck spitsoutsmartdeck problem i ve noticed that i only get this problem when the smartdeck is cold usually first thing in the morning clearly this is the tape deck thinking the smartdeck is a jammed tape try warming the smartdeck by blowing warm breath into the hole where the fake tape is then put it back in in cold weather the deck itself is also going to be cold so you may have to do this several times until the entire car warms up it seems to me that this problem has become less pronounced over time i rarely have to do this more than once nowadays unfortunately i don t have a workaround for the intermittent track skipff problem i have seen that once or twice though in general that feature tends to work for me both track skip and track ff rewind i have a suspicion that this is another cold weather problem and a side effect of the spits outtape problem but now that i have a workaround for the latter problem i ve not seen this problem in over a year ironically if you manage to avoid all these warts the smartdeck is the best sounding adapter i ve ever heard plus the auto onoff feature is much more valuable than you might think and no one seems to complain that this feature is broken with the four other adapters i ve tried two cassette and two fm transmitter i cannot tell you how many times i forgot to turn my ipod off when i exited the car then came back to a dead ipod nevertheless the warts are pretty obnoxious therefore i must deduct stars from this otherwise star product 
expensive for a toy very poor as an instrument i purchased this guitar for my young boys the strings don t stay in tune long enough to tune them all together i put lighter strings and new tuners on it but that did not help i didn t expect much but it should at least be able to be tuned 
why have a five disk changer that cannot shuffle i purchased a sony disk cd changer in that could shuffle between all five disks this model can only shuffle tracks on one disk at a time what were they thinking the ability to shuffle tracks between disks was my entire reason for choosing a five disk changer vs a single disk cd dvd player this baby is going back 
look out mine blew up the batteries what a mess called eton they said never heard of this happening took it back for a refund now i hear a recall is in place 
defective product prevents use of docking station a v out italk mic warning your ipod may already be stuck ! good luck trying to get your ipod out of its case once it gets into it why you ask would you want to get your ipod out of this sleek looking case perhaps because like me you realize that the case s thickness prevents the use of the docking station but not the cable by itself apple s a v out cable which goes into the headphone jack and griffin s italk voice recorder if you only plug headphones into your ipod then the case is great if you have any inklings of a plan to use any accessories beyond just the headphones avoid this case 
beware if you have a cable modem for broadband connection to the internet your unit will not be covered by the aps warranty on this device lightning hit near our house and the motherboard plus router got fried the cable modem stayed intact and we filed a claim with aps they denied it saying backend surges through the cable may have caused the damage even though the modem wasn t hurt 
lasted one week having had problems with a previous usb drive i bought the lacie as a replacement having been brought under the impression that it was a superior quality and therefore more expensive than the previous drive it has lasted one week and after hours on the phone to the manufacturer s support line no one has a clue what the fault is this drive and it s support team are a complete waste of time and money 
can t find a fit i bought these on a limb i hadn t read any reviews hadn t seen them in action not that it would have helped everyone rates these stars especially here on amazon but i couldn t find ones that fit i tried every piece i tried pulling my ear using different pieces on each ear and nothing would ever work they d always fall out on the slightest movement or anything sitting here right now after trying to figure out a way to make them fit for minutes leaves me extremely frustrated and wishing i could return them nope guess not hundred bucks down the drain grrr 
my wife says they don t last i got these for my wife who listens to am radio on her portable sony radio while commuting on the bus and train days a week she would run through a ton of regular alkaline aaa batteries so rechargeables made sense she has a pair of the energizer s and a pair of duracell s that are of the same capacity and she says that the energizer s are terrible and hardly hold a charge we use a maha mh cfs charger which charges each battery independently so they don t get overcharged what else can you say about rechargeables either they last long or they don t these energizer s do not we recently got a pair of sony aaa s and they seem to be even better than the duracell s 
did not work this product does not work at all i called tech support and they agree they told me to send it back and get another one i did it did not work either i sent it back and got my money back amazon was great but the avertv card is junk 
not powerful enough i needed an antenna that provided a power boost to amplify the signal i bought this antenna based on the review of others if i had realized it didn t amplify the signal i would have looked elsewhere oh well my bad ! i live miles from the signal i m trying to capture and this antenna didn t do it for me 
doesn t work as well as the neuros there s a reason this is cheaper than the neuros mpeg recorder plus it doesn t work as well i originally tried to save a few bucks and grabbed a v mate but it went back after every recording had a squiggly white line on the top of the image and the quality just wasn t up to snuff upgraded to the neuros and have been very happy 
not comfortable and too expensive for what you get this gel mousepad with wristrest is pretty hard on the wrist you really have to press hard to get it to conform to the shape of your wrist is isn t very comfortable the gel is made from plastic polymers and it has an odour of plastic it is not washable so it gets dirty and stays dirty you can t replace the gel packs if it gets a leak there are better mousepads with gel wristrests out there 
if you want extensive pois or clear bluetooth this is not the unit for you i had the tomtom go for about days before i decided to return it overall the user interface is great and very easy to understand and configure the setup was easy and i also thought that the windshield suction cup mount worked well which i know a lot of other people complained about the items that led me to return the unit are as follows bluetooth hands free the clarity on this wasn t bad on my end but the anyone i talked to on the other end of the phone couldn t hear me well i had the external mic on my visor so it was probably no more than feet from my mouth unless i was holding it in front of my mouth the connection wasn t clear i also had problems where my motorola razr v would simply disconnect from the tomtom for no reason or send a call straight to voicemail rather than letting it ring through the tomtom the point of interest database is lacking i had read this in other articles but didn t believe it could be that bad i was wrong ! basically when it comes to restaurants it only contains fast food and aside from that anything retail related is lacking if you are just looking for navigation where you aren t relying on pois and don t need hands free calling this unit would work fine but then again without those features you could get something much cheaper that would get the job done ! overall this product is not worth the money 
waste of money you ll end up looking for something better sound fidelity is pretty bad 
look elsewhere for better values when you move significantly above the mark with headphones one naturally expects superior sound and build quality things that can be found with competing phones like the grado sr alessandro ms or even the sony mdr v for one thing the body of these headphones is made of a relatively flimsy plastic and lends little in the way of confidence in the product the sound the part that matters may impress neophyytes with their strong bass but balance and richness of tone are sorely absent perhaps that s why may triport owners find themselves defecting to other products bose has earned a name through aggressive advertising and name recognition but if you re a savvy shopper and are willing to look at some superb competing headphones sometimes at half the price you and your music will be in a better place 
no workie unit apparently does not work with older magnavox vhs wasted my money 
it hums alas it makes a very noticeable hum even when it s off ! i have to unplug it if i want the noise to stop very disappointing but if size matters to you it s worth mentioning that it s surprisingly small especially in comparison to other portable stereos it is easy to carry and fits anywhere edit dec and now it s incredibly fickle frequently interrupting a cd with err or not even playing it at all i want to replace it but where are all the red cd players 
disappointing i just received it today and will be returning it tomorrow here s what i found on my unit switching channels pausing a program or switching unputs caused my tv to lose the hdmi signal for seconds when the original source was digital or component video the screen would just be black during this time but on analog inputs the screen would go bright green then flash between green the analog data for a second before finally becoming stable given that we often channel surf using our vcr this was unacceptable for some reason it messes up the hdmi signal coming in from my comcast dvr when i run the hdmi cable directly from the dvr to my tv i am able to permanently set my tv to aspect ratio when using the hdmi input and all programs come out looking ok the tv will put black bars on the side of aspect ratio programs on non hd channels however running the hdmi signal through the receiver meant that all shows were displayed in widescreen the tv was no longer able to figure out which shows should be in and which should be in as others have mentioned you can only use zone speakers with analog inputs which on my system means you can t listen to cd s since i use a digital input and the zone controls are really difficult to use 
the newer maxell are now junk cd s i used to buy these all the time they were made in japan and had a bluish dye to them and when you held them up to the light you couldn t see through them i never had a bad burn the newer ones are now made in taiwan they have a silver dye and are see through when held up to the light these cd s suck don t buy them 
horrible keyboard and mouse i am very unhappy with this combo and will return it the wireless connection is terrible and the keys on the keyboard stick brand new i like my logitech optical mouse much better 
do not buy this pda i got a whole six months use out of this unit before the battery would no longer charge this is apparently very common for these units check out some of the forums around relating in particular to the battery problems i checked with palmone and it will cost to replace the battery plus shipping they will only replace at palm what is the point in buying a unit if you have to spend another after six months you are better off buying a zire 
battery life isn t all that the old phone i had was heavy and the battery life was horrible you have to put this phone on the charger every night or you won t have a phone in the morning even if you don t use it that much i thought for the price that it would be the best phone in the world to my suprise the only great thing is that it s not heavy 
i whish i d received written conformation i paid for it and got an e mail link but have yet to receive the written conformation called the it s been a month if it s this hard to get the plan i wonder how it will be if i need to replace my product 
gamble my card started with corrupt pictures from nikon d after a few months it is no longer recognized in the camera or card readers emails to transcend have gone unanswered 
tip broke off in one year the headphones sound great no arguement there however i was removing the plastic tips which need to be changed every several months and the headphones broke the company has only a one year warranty so i was out ofluck again i thought the sound was great but for this price i would expect them to be more durable i was hardly touching them when they broke off also the earpiece can be a bit uncomfortable at times 
one word disappointment i didn t give it a one because it started out ok i have a compaq presario with the integrated intel video chipset i purchased the ali pt usb pci to usb card to use with an external gb usb hard drive i inserted the card into an open slot and everything went pretty smooth install wise the card worked wonderfully with the hard drive then i bought a gb ipod this is where my previously considered star card went south i plugged it into the card and everything froze i tried every conceived configuration but to no avail then i also learned my odessa pressure pad my compaq usb keyboard or even a usb logitech mouse won t even work with it the rule of thumb is your usb devices will work as fast as the slowest link in the chain but it should work the ipod works if i plug it into one of my integrated onboard usb slots albeit sans the transfer speed of usb frustrated i did some research and found the chipset the ali card uses to be incompatible with many usb devices what s the point of that lesson learned if you re going to buy an inexpensive pci usb card and want to take the chance it will work for you then go ahead but the nec chipset is the way to go for across theboard compatibility i hope this helps someone 
old technology from emerson research i used to have this same unit under the brand name emerson research it s a pretty good unit but it s a very old model for the price you can get a much more modern one from emerson research at a local store 
buy the gamelink instead by purchasing this cable set you are limiting your options you now must use your a v receiver for sound whenever you play a game because you loose the analog sound connection you have with the the analog sound comes out of the same port as the video spend the dollars you save on an inexpensive optical cable and you now have the best of both worlds you have the option of using the tv for sound or the a v receiver with the same quality video i will say that the video quality on my hdtv improved dramatically with the addition of the component red green blue video gamelink over the composite one video cable connection that comes with the ps however if you re the kind of person who thinks the must be better because it s a bigger number than the it probably won t matter to you anyway 
great product if i could use it i did the research on this product and it was one of the best i don t know that to be true due to the fact that the software that they sent me was a demo version that was outdated for use i have to buy another software package to opperate the product that had stated in the description that the software was included one if not the only reason i had purchased it i e mailed tiger com and received no reply if your going to sell something false advertisement is not the way 
dvi version sucks cable won t fitpower supply cable covers other connectorsmouse does not not workincludes flash update cable but web site has no flash imagesif you don t plug a keyboard into it sits there and just beepswhat idiot designed this trash 
hughesnet direcway satellite customers beware if you use either the dw or dw satellite modems and don t have a land line telephone do not buy tivo ! despite what their website advertises tivo series dvrs cannot get programming updates over satellite internet tivo blames hughesnet and vice versa tivo customer support is so bad i would put it in the same category with direcway hughesnet calling is a waste of your time they do not care tivo wouldn t offer me a refund after advanced technical support promised to extend my warranty until their engineering dept could provided an upcoming patch when the patch failed to fix anything they told me to change my internet provider like i could if i wanted to or that i was simply out of luck they offered to cancel my tivo service but no refund amazing ineptitude when dvrs work they are really cool but buyer beware there must be better dvrs out there i sure hope so 
incredible rip off list price over actual price you ve got to be kidding ! i never accuse companies of raping consumers because we are free to choose what we buy and how much we spend but this smells of taking advantage of consumer ignorance if you want to connect your ipod to your home stereo get a stereo mini plug to rca plug y adapter at radio shack that s all you need because you already have a recharger it came with your ipod the only additional capability this kit provides is holding your ipod upright i have this item it came free with my gb ipod and although it offers a slight convenience over not having it the price is a terrible rip off 
did not work this drive has a great aesthetic design but did not work out of the box when i received it amazon delivered promptly as usual but quality of this product is definitely lacking look at the western digital that s what i now have and have had no issues 
looks great works bad i bought this for my kids who love the frozen drinks but i soon found that it does not work well after a few uses the gears began to stick it would no longer crush shave ice stick with the smaller units 
not for use on treadmill i bought these headphones to watch tv while on the treadmill they don t work at all for that purpose interference from the motor causes them to cut out they work great when i stop the treadmill 
disappointing there were several disappointments with this product first it shipped without a transformer assuming one would use it only with batteries its controls are cumbersome sound is ok 
cd player broke after week just a warning after week of very light use the cd player is unable to play any cds the radio still works but the cd player is not working not impressed with the quality 
netgear fails my wgx began to fail roughly around the end of the one year warranty when it did finally fail due to manufacturing defects days after the warranty had expired netgear would not stand behind their product in any way unless you re into buying disposable networking gear avoid this product 
not very reliable i had to go through five disks in order to write two recovery disks for my pc at this rate i might get good disks out of the 
worked great when it worked worked after i opened the box took on a plane didnt work after the plane ride tried again after removing and repositioning batteries repeatedly then it worked ! then i tried to use it again later didnt work ! not sure if it s a loose connection or what when the speakers work they re great but they hardly ever work 
mount is too small for my handle bar the thing wouldn t even fit around my handle bar i had to zip tie it on a waste of 
i returned this item not functional this item was not practical it looked good but not being able to zip the sides all the way down because of the cute water bottles was not very functional 
coasters i wish they had a rating for zero stars i bought the fifty pack and had good burns and coasters that s a success rate i subsequently bought verbatim data life and have burned so far with no coasters memorex has really gone downhill 
get an ipod instead this gadget worked fine for exactly one year and months it was used nearly everyday until the on button stopped working unfortunately the warranty is only for one year i bought this when the price was inflated it should not cost more than bucks for a year and a half of service ! if you want a positive review read some of the others 
i ve finally learned a very expensive lesson don t buy this product there simple advice i wish someone had given me before i bought two of these with the first one the battery died months after purchase since it was days outside the warrantly apple support told me sorry tough luck i made the mistake of buying another one figuring i just got a bad one and there was no way i could have the same problem again wrong second ipod just died same battery problem this one died within the warranty period but becuase it took me two weeks to get into the ipod store to see what was wrong and of course by the time i got in i was past the month warranty period who keeps track of the purchase date i sure didn tother than the fact that your substnatial investment will be worthless in about a year it is a fantastic product i m just sorry that it didn t last twice cause otherwise i d be a fan 
exactly the same as the regular intuos pen but dollars more and hideous i have a platinum intuos tablet a high school graduation present from and when i broke the pen i ordered the regular intuos pen due to it s being slightly cheaper on wacom s site here the platinum is dollars more and in my opinion much uglier i recommend buying the classic intuos pen 
iogear laser terrible the iogear laser mice mouses are terrible i bought this mouse gme and the travel desktop mouse and the sensitivty reaction of both mice are the worst i ve ever seen good luck trying to point the cursor where you want it to go the cursor dances across the screen even when i m not touching the mouse i ve tried them on different desktops and a laptop computer it s a disgrace 
poor choice for sony icf swgr i purchased this adaptor thinking i could use it to power my i was wrong it makes so much rf noise i wonder why sony even makes it still looking for a clean adaptor 
nice features but very unreliable i bought this phone for the great features and because i ve had good luck with other motorola products the phones and answering machine are easy to set up but that is about the only redeeming quality that they have the handsets frequently lose connection with the base unit the only way to get them working again is to unplug and then replug the power to the base unit which loses the answering machine settings range on the handsets is only mediocre i can t talk in the far corners of the house even with the base centrally located also battery life is very limited overall the phones are very disappointing and i would definitely recommend not buying them 
summary avoid ! cute but worthless unless you have a new imac g summary avoid ok here s how you re supposed to use the apple remote with an ipod plug the ipod into the new universal dock turn the ipod on select a playlist grab the remote sit down in your chair start playing music now do you want to change playlists or adjust some other setting on your ipod well guess what the menu button on the apple remote doesn t work with ipods so you have to get up go across the room to where the ipod is plugged into the stereo and change the settings on the ipod so what can you do with this remote with an ipod well you can pause songs you can increase or decrease the volume and you can skip back or forth through songs in a playlist basically this is the ipod equivalent of a s tv remote control it s a complete waste of money because you can t browse your playlists or change settings on the ipod i don t know what steve jobs was thinking when this piece of junk was released or what he was smoking summary avoid 
don t buy a coby system i bought this system for my baby s room i needed a player that had a repeat function this player constantly gives a no disc code and it is impossible to get it to play the advice given by the coby people is to leave the cd door open and unit on to remove any humidity even when i do get it to recognize a disk it then won t play it spins and spins looking for a track then when it finally finds a track it skips and sputters constantly don t waste your money spend the extra bucks to get a good system now i have to spend double the money to replace this unit coby customer service sucks 
disappointed i can not express how disappointed in the poor design of this item to charge the battery was an incredible hassle at least amazon made iteasy to return when we weren t happy 
not for use with radios i recently purchased this item along with a sony icf mv radio for which it is listed by sony as an accessory don t buy this item for use with any radio sony or other as it produces static at lower frequencies and a steady signal obliterating loud hum at higher frequencies when i called sony about this the person with whom i spoke indicated an awareness of the problem the recommended adaptor is an ac ehg but it is not available in the us ! it is listed on the sony style canada site but they will not ship to the us catch completed 
stayaway from it i have so for used inav iguidance mapopolisnavigon navigator and the blue logger street atlas usa out of all these the blue logger street atlas usa is the worst and inav iguidance is the best blue logger gps hardware is good but v impractical to use bcuz of its strange onoff button i will not recommend it to anyone simply waste of time and mone 
hoping for the best i bought this cobra watt inverter to upgrade my existing watt inverter in our travel trailer it arrived quickly and in about a week i was installing it this turned out to be quite a hassle because the cobra uses two positive and two negative power input lead cables my old inverter used one of each i had to buy all new cables to hook it to my batteries once that was done i switched it on so far so good i plugged my circuit checker into it and got an open neutral reading hmmmm not good however it did seem to operate all my on board stuff properly though showing an open neutral at every plug in the coach however in short order the unit gave out boom no power i checked to be sure there was no break in the incoming power and checked for power at the plugs on the unit nothing i called cobra customer support and the gentleman asked about all the tests i d done and i d already done all he would have asked me to do he said the only thing he could suggest now was to mail it to them and their techs would put it on the bench and determine what was wrong so i shipped it off the next day and that s where we stand now waiting to hear what s wrong with it or get a new one to replace it it s been over two months 
very unreliable very unreliable i have used dvd rw and cd rw memorex disks on multiple computers and dvd recorders i find that they don t last get about re recordings not may crap out on any occasion multiple cd rw s with critical material would not read on multiple computers avoid memorex dvd rw cd rw disks ! 
terrible terrible product and evidently not made by sharp i bought this travel alarm at target it was shoddy from the outset but for i managed to use it despite the dim display and tinny alarm for one trip then i realized the battery only lasts a few weeks i would have spent more on batteries than the clock itself in the first year it also began to literally pull apart at the seams i mailed the clock to sharp s corporate headquarters in nj with my complaint and received a letter back saying it wasn t one of their products even though it clearly says sharp right on the front so either they are lying and producing terrible products or they are not protecting their trademark and allowing other companies to manufacture shoddy products and market them with the sharp name either way i could never buy a product with the sharp name on it again how could i ever be sure if it would be backed up by sharp or not 
hidden ink cost very deceptive this printer only printed about dvds and ran out of ink the replacement ink cartridges cost more than the printer i called epson on two different numbers to try to get the facts about the ink quantity in cartridges and no one seems to know the answer they gave me a third telephone number which is not an number and it doesn t work the qualtiy of printing on dvds is very good but the printer does not function well and has to be restarted at the beginning of each print job this is a very time consuming process i could live with this but the ink cost is too high about for a printer that is available for about 
not easy to configure print server requires fairly in depth knowlage to set up after setting ip address and being able to ping the address i could still not get my offices printer to work properly even worse the support from d link support was poor to say the least i returned the item and bought a hp printer that had a nic port included in printe 
nice gps product used it for cross usa ny ca so learned a lot about it it performed very well probably saved me at least an hour every day looking at maps and still getting lost as most gps products it does not have texttospeech i e it tells you turn right left take exit etc but the name of street to turn on or number of exit is only displayed you have to look to see it so far i only used it as gps not as pocket pc 
not what i thought i was extremely disappointed in this purchase it turned out to be a refurbished model that did not work ! there was no indication beforehand that it was not a brand new item i had to pay ups to send it back then i only received a partial refund for the returned item it cost me a bundle to learn not to buy anything from amazon again 
don t buy this this product was absolutely awful first of all it is very picky about the usb port you are using my first attempt was to use it through a usb hub because my mac mini doesn t have enough free ports it did not like the usb hub at all the second issue i had was range i was not able to use it from more than feet away and even within feet it was not able to go through items at all this is an rf remote but it still required line of site to work reliably i was able to stop it from working by putting it behind a large pillow pathetic 
great service if you never plan on canceling i have been a subscriber for years back in november my account was turned off due to a billing issue the week prior to it being turned off i started receiving calls a day for payment i advised one of the reps to wait a week for the payment payment was made calls stopped for another week the radio was then turned off and the calls a day started up again i explained to the bill collectors i owed nothing and when offered to reactivate the radio i told them not to bother at this point i wanted nothing more to do with xm they offered me months of free service to come back anyone who cancels can get this by the way and i refused the calls a day continued for the next week i was informed that it simply takes a week for your name to fall out of their automated system more months go by and then i start receiving a bill saying that i reactivated my radio and owe for months of service and all the late fees that go with that dollars i call in and state i never reactivated my radio thus i don t owe for reactivating my radio and the months of service that would have followed the customer service rep told me that it would be taken cared of weeks later i get another bill i call back and the rep tells me the same thing and apologizes for my inconveniences i even called back the next day just to make sure it was finally resolved and that rep confirmed that i no longer owed anything so then last month i start receiving collections notices you have one month to pay this before it goes to collections i called in and was promised they would look into it and call me back this apparently has taken care of the issue though i never received the call back this week i called times of which i was promptly hung up on for no reason and was told each time that it had been resolved so hopefully this time it really is to anyone considering xm i suggest you just get an mp player 
measure studs spacement first big dissapointment ! i should have read the reviews more carefully i bought this unit because it was recommended as accessory to the sansumg lcd i was purchasing from amazon it turns out this is a very limited mount if you plan to fix it to a dry wall you cannot slide the bars horizontally and the center of the openings are apart with a little leeway both sides if the studs are apart like mine forget it what a bummer amazon should place a caveat next to its recommendation as accesory 
it s not a scratch repair kit just a scratch kit when i paid somewhere between a couple of months ago for the optifix pro kit i made the wrongful assumption that a high price tag would entail good craftsmanship in contrast with some of the cheaper radial cleaners i ve owned before the package s description made it seem promising enough and i ve had mostly good experiences with memorex in the past so i just had put it to the test immediately after taking the product home after reading the instruction guide carefully before use i m positive the product was being used properly but unfortunately the optifix pro just couldn t deliver the goods in fact not only could it do nothing to restore any of the discs i inserted it worsened the scratches it was supposed to repair ! what s more frustrating two of the discs it served to further damage are out of print and therefore irreplacable i hope fellow cd collectors will sympathize with my message and steer clear of this particular memorex product 
far better than the other versions of this product i ve used several other versions of this product and this seems to be the one that works the best and is the most durable the design makes it easy to insert and remove ipod unlike the newer versions and the elasticity of the armband makes it easy to slide on and off one s arm i would highly recommend this product 
do not buy these speakers crackle horribly i sent them back had new ones sent to me times and they were all like that it is a cool product toobad they don t work 
doesn t live up to the specs on the box gigabit the speeds are about megabytes per second does that sound like gigabit since it is a file server you would expect to be able to have multiple shares right wrong only one at any one time mac compatible hardly it s more like the mac can connect but it doesn t have appleshares or appletalk ipthe ui is really bad i updated to of the firmware but that didn t help any of these problems other than that it was great 
dissapointing i bought these to replace a pair of sony fontopias i had i loved the sonys but was trying to save some money and most of the reviews seemed favorable while they are ok earphones i was dissapointed with the sound range and quality they really dont block out much ambient noise and the fit is not very comfortable for they work but i wouldnt order them again 
didn t work for me i tried to install the driver on my computer the computer went into a loop just booting shutting down and rebooting i was able to get the computer into safe mode and use system restore to revert to an earlier point im scared to try it again any body want it i ll sell it cheap for that matter just pay the postage and it s yours 
avery matte cd labels although these labels were functional i was disappointed as the paper is far thinner than for similar labels i had purchased previously and these tended to tear easily 
don t buy if near us canada border this gps comes with us map on the sd card and canada map on the included cd but never the twain shall meet by car i m a few hours from canada and several days from the eastern us but i can t swap out the faraway eastern us part of the map on the tomtom go for a nearby canadian map it s either all canada or all contiguous us this is a major functional flaw if you live near the us canada border or live further away and like to take cross border trips oh and if you do decide to swap out the us map be sure to save it on your computer first tomtom doesn t bother to provide a backup on the cd so if you don t first make your own backup before changing to the canadian map you can t later get the us map back 
buyer beware this product is the worst sony product ever because of the lousy software included nero it has never worked correctly even after downloading every patch and update available avoid this product at all costs 
i hope the second gps works better than the first one the gps worked fine for a couple of days and then it never turned on again i sent a mail to digitechdeals and they told me to send them the gps and they would send me a new one the new shall arrive this week fast response from digitechdeals 
the worst avoid at all costs a terrible product extremely difficult to use way too easy to accidentally change the combination and when that happens it s useless the only reason it gets one star is that the rating system does not allow a zero or a negaive number don t waste your money on this product 
neither fail safe nor fail seldom ran fine for just over a year pointedly this took it just beyond the warranty period then the converter in the ac power cord failed mearly bursting into flames unfortunately the failure mode also took out the modem itself so instead of a power cord i got to replace the whole modem i bought a different brand this time with a year warranty ominously however both modems were made in china 
professional heavy backpack i purchased the backpack and thought the many compartments would be great however there is not as much room for documents and folders and i thought the padding is great for laptop protection the backpack is very heavy and hurts my back when carrying through an airport the style and look is good function is poor 
green picture i got this at best buy months ago its been serviced twice has a replacement board and there is a month wait for more replacement boards digital and scaler the picture is lime green especially on the left side the tech keeps saying all of them this model have a green picture so repairs won t work so here i sit waiting for repair by the way don t get it at best buy or use their warranty its a big battle getting them to replace it or even fix it fyi this model wasn t made by sharp it was made by a far inferior manufacturer and the picture shows it anyway it would be a great set if it wasn t like looking thru lime green jello perhaps the other aquos models live up to their rep 
it doesn t work i bought an ipod nano gen microblaster for my yearold daughter s christmas present when it came it didn t work i sent it back and they replaced it the new one worked for weeks and then it would no longer work on batteries i talked to jlab about it and they seemed skeptical i don t know why after another week the thing wouldn t work when plugged into the wall basically this speaker just doesn t work i read the other reviews before i bought this product maybe the gen speakers were better but don t waste your money on the gen 
didnt travel well while traveling in china i hooked up this charger to a sharper image voltage converter and had to through it away after it started smoking a much better buy would be the sony charger with worldwide voltage and for dollars less 
do not purchase this hard drive to those people who said they haven t had any problems with this hard drive just give it a few months i bought the hard drive advertised here back in december about months ago it was working great until one day i turned my computer on and lo and behold windows gives me the error the drive is not ready its door may be open a great error message for a hard drive by the way micro oft i can t access my data anymore it s all down the tubes buy this hard drive at your own risk 
star if comes w own s manual booklet unfortunately comes with electronic format only what happen to people doesn t had any computer with printer what i m going to do when i need information regarding the navigator on my road trip i only got this garmin few days so far i m very happy with it except this lack of print owner s manual this is a great gps direct me without any confuss got almost everything incluing a months free trail of fm triffic message garmin should incluing a owner s manual booklet in this high end price gps 
disappointed this may be a good sd don t know because the company would not allow shipment to hawaii therefore ordered the viking sd and it has been a very good sd 
piece of s t the belt clip is lose after having it for month can not attach to pants have to hold it in my hands 
coming apart at the seams in theory an excellent product room for lots of disks relatively compact and attractive however i purchased three of these for me for a friend i can t say how his is doing but both of mine have faulty zippers making it impossible to close the binders and therefore losing much of their attractiveness and compactness all in all a disappointment 
not worth the money it made little notable difference or improvement i would not recommend this product for small scratches and it only makes minor improvements to anything more serious 
a waste of money this is without fail the most difficult to use software i have ever seen i have way better luck using ms publisher and even word for making tray liners i found this product to be a time consuming waste of money the more time you invest in loearning this software the more you lose who wrote this program anyway fire them 
incompatibity issues i bought this machine to replace a sportrak made by the same company years ago i liked the features of the unit itself larger screen much brighter better battery it s main problem is that it is not compatible with a large library of software maps mapsend made by the same company that i had purchased for the sportrak there was no bridging software to make the images compatible you are basically forced to buy the same maps again at a higher price that seemed unfair to me so i returned it 
simply doesn t work same as above will not work with dell considering dell s share of the computer market don t you think amazon ought to tell us this even if the manufacturer and the retail store don t why doesn t amazon check these customer ratings and refuse to sell products which get or stars across the board 
a warning do not use i had no problems burning to these discs its when i went back a few months later to these discs and found out that none of them work anymore after further research i found out that memorex uses the cheapest dye available and thus the dvds have absolutelly no life to them my discs started dying after a few months in addition in you physically hold the disc in your hands you can feel how warped physically it has become this is true for all the discs about of them i can not not recommend this product stronly enough 
have some problems with the cds the first cd in this pack was damaged even before writing well i was able to write the second one without issues hope the rest of them would be fine too 
do not stay in your ears when these headphones sit properly in your ears they need to be pressed into the ear they sound awesome my problem is i can t get them to stay where i put them i have tried all the cups provided but i commute on a bus and any small bump will shift the earphones resulting in inferior sound i would not recommend them for this reason the comfort factor is also a consideration you really need to get used to having an object pressed into your ear 
great bag battery is not included i love the bag but did not receive a battery i called amazon and my only choice was to return the bag when ordering the bag i thought i seen that it was coming from antonline whatever that is i have not found a way to contact them i was told by amazon that i would have to contact hp i called but today is jan and of course all i got was automation 
hate this clock the clock is a great size for travel but i don t like it at all it doesn t synch quickly enough to the atomic clock the instructions do not tell you which atomic clock to select and changing the alarm time is difficult if you get up at the same time each day it would be fine but if you change your schedule it s too much work had an old casio clock that was almost as small that worked much better than does this 
never really did work perhaps i am luckier my netgear adapter crapped out five times in the first two weeks after reading all these negative reviews i decided just to take it back while i still could netgear support was spotty some reps really tried but i had one simply give up and walk away fromt the call 
not for textbooks i wish i never bought this because it was not sturdy enough for textbooks if you put a textbook on it and turn the page it collapses and or tears the page i wouldn t even use this for a notebook 
disappointment the product didn t do what it said it would i cut the power to use it in my car i shouldn t have assumed it worked properly so i couldn t return it and ended wasting i was extremly dissapointed in this product 
cheap product this adapter seems pretty cheaply made no matter which stereo i use it with the music only comes out of the right speaker so music with a lot of panning sounds pretty bad i d go with a pricier model next time 
the other reviews are correct i ve purchased and attempted to install three of these adapters one of them was on an older dell laptop installed without any problems at all and connected seamlessly to a linksys wrtg router with wap encryption the problems really started showing when i tried to install the second and third adapters both on desktop computers running windows xp sp the software installation was a breeze but when i plugged in the adapter nothing happened connect to network which network scan who what it looks like this adapter has a very very short range and doesn t work very well a wall or two in between the routers it would see the router and connect to drop the connection and not find one but then it would find it again and on and off never really worked as expected on the desktops so i ve given up i ve had to disconnect them and reconnect them multiple times downloaded the updated software from belkin s site and still have connection issues with the desktops the laptop works fine as long as i don t take it one room away from the router avoid at all costs please i ve used other wireless devices with the same router that i m trying to connect and they work fine a few rooms away and all spend a few more dollars and get something worth the money spent spend less time troubleshooting and more time surfing good luck 
walkie talkie arrived damaged and seller would not back the product amazon stood behind the sale and refunded payment beware of certain sellers 
bad compatibility i have the older larger version of this product however it uses the same software the labels are great and the spring device that is used to apply the labels is great but the software is awful there is no direct macintosh program rather there are templates they were written for old versions of software and really don t work right the windows side includes an actual print shop style program which works awfully if you do get this make your own template on appleworks or powerpoint 
important note not sata hard drive i thought that this was an sata hard drive because the label is ata but is in in fact an eide hard drive so when i bought it i was unable to install it this was probably my fault but no where in the product description does it say that it is eide so i am putting this review up in hopes that no one else mistakenly buys this hard drive 
quotit doesn t work quot in my case it was a total waste of money quotit doesn t work quot after numerous calls to command support and sending unit back for bench chk problem was not rectified with no solution from manufacture it will not auto switch to fax when online which is the main reason for purchase quotdoesnt work as advertised quot it went into the garbage 
avoid westinghouse not worth the savings i purchased this westinghouse p monitor lvmw because i was very impressed with its ability to be used as both a high res monitor for work but also an hdtv for play with an xbox the product itself is pretty good the picture is great colors are wonderful but if you have any kind of problem with this product it is game over westinghouse digital has no online support to speak of i ve sent numerous emails through their site and have received no responses over a month i finally got in contact with a customer service agent through my extended warranty service and it turns out westinghouse has no local technicians to even examine your machine you have to ship it to them at your cost for them to examine and they said it will take weeks or more before they will get back to you this policy is completely egregious months time to fix a quickly depreciating machine and it costs the customer shipping do a little research and you will see all the customer service horror stories with this product after people have had it for a while go with a real manufacturer with local repair technicians 
disappointed in gb xd picture card type h i purchased this card to use in my fujifilm finepix s camera for a family vacation i had researched it beforehand to make sure i could use this card in the camera there is an h and an m card apparently they save things in a different format and the m card does not allow for taking videos with this camera i purchased the h card and used it mostly to take still photos upon returning home and downloading the photos to my computer i was extremely disappointed to find that once i had copied them to my computer i was unable to view them on my camera anymore and i did not choose to erase them from the card i got an error message on the camera and my only choice was to format the card which meant everything would be erased i wasn t happy but i couldn t view the photos anyway so i did format it that was one problem the other problem i had was that several of the photos were displayed as question marks on my computer with no image at all others looked fine in the thumbnails but when opened the top half of them was fine but the bottom half was either solid gray or spliced and repeated it was crazy ! these are memories that can t be recaptured so it was very upsetting i do not trust the card at all and i will not purchase another one ! 
of dvdrs got errors they have no label on the top hard tell which side is up these are the worst dvdrs i have ever seen and used the speed is much slower than other brand dvdr such as ridata although they are both x of dvdrs got errors during burning but other brand dvdrs are ok i am going to return these package to amazon 
not for all ipods this product does not hold the smaller ipods well at all only should be bought by people with the bigger model ipods 
not to be relied upon sometimes it works sometimes not takes a very long to find position i wish i had read the other reviews before purchasing it i would have chosen another 
if you plan on listening to music with this think again two big problems with this dvd player one based on experience i stupidly assumed all dvd players display elapsed time while playing disks this one just shows the track number if you want to know how much of a movie you ve watched to mentally calculate how much is left you re out of luck two this thing stinks for playing music regardless of how your cd is encoded it will pause two seconds between every track which can be irritating when you re playing a cd of allegedly continuous music like an opera or the white album or dark side of the moon i called toshiba to ask about this and they were confirmed this they said all toshiba dvd players pause between music tracks and that basically i was stuck so i m warning you and frankly i think they should print a warning on every box something like wont play music properly ! just going to make you mad and i m not buying toshiba again 
not worth the money i live in an area with no xm repeaters and must rely on good satelite reception i have purchased sets of headphones for use with my inno both of which crapped out after only a few weeks use check antenna message it seems that this has been a common problem with other users i won t be buying another set at least until a different manufacturer produces them 
hype bought new ear piece for new ipod had koss plugs panasonics are awful tried all the sizes guess i don t have the right ears for these koss plugs are great reverted back to them and have no desire to upgrade after hearing panasonics are the sony look alikes any better 
i am thoroughly disappointed over the confusion of operation i have been a loyal sony product user for over years however their compact disc recorder rcd wcw is the most confusing piece of equipment to operate that i have ever seen it reminds me of apparently the latest manufacturing thought about anything high tech incorporate as many bells and whistles as you can to accommodate everyone s tastes for instance why does it need a remote how many people will be cutting cds from their easy chairs i have a call in to two friends who i hope can rescue me from my dilemma 
buy sandisk instead i recently received this as a christmas gift and it didn t work from the start after much time wasted with their tech support the device was deemed defective their tech support is very poor all they could say try another xd card the device kept freezing my system the driver that came with the software didn t work a very frustrating experience if the tech support was more informative or supportive lexar might have redeemed itself i recently purchased the sandisk in reader and it works like a charm right from the start their quick start guide is much more detailed and their software works ! save yourself a headache and buy sandisk 
bad choice digital outputs do not do well my computer cabinet is feet away from the monitor in the other room i got this mainly because i wanted to reduce wiring and introduce an optical coaxial cable to my receiver instead of audio rca cables all the way to the receiver plus wanted to be able to control individual speaker volumes on the pc couldnt do that in optical or coaxial mode no way this card can only do stereo mode with digital output so i am using those analog outputs to the receiver atleast from the cabinet to my desk its usb so my mission is half accomplished but hey wait one more shocking thing i noticed is that the volume control is in no way co ordinated which means that as you turn the volume each speaker is incremented decremented unevenly takes place subtle so you dont notice it much but if youre into very low decibel listening you will certainly pull your hair over this overall an ok card if you like decent looks if you want something cheaper go for an audigy se instead it does exactly the same thing at half the cost 
poor quality and the worst customer service had the printer for just over a year with light use i started getting numerous error messages then the printer would stop printing in the middle of a page or i couldn t get it to print at all spent over two hours in a hp chat session that made little sense was told to push buttons my printer doesn t have and when i told the rep that nothing happened after a procedure to re set the printer she replied great that means it worked was then offered the option of getting the printer serviced for the same price i paid for it a year ago or upgrading to a c for which is more than the current price on amazon this product has been a waste of time money and energy 
seems that toshiba quality has gone down lately i ve owned several toshiba televisions over the years and the one striking feature they all had was solid build quality and excellent reception and picture quality not so with this model even with an amplified vhf uhf antenna and living in a major metro area reception is subpar on many channels the picture jumps a lot doesnt sync and is subject to image ghosting this is a shame because the dvd player and dvd picture quality is excellent so this unit is indeed a mixed blessing look elsewhere for a quality tv dvd combo unit update as of yesterday i discovered that this dvd player will not play several dvd s i fed it ! i had purchased some educational dvd s for my toddler and out of the it only plays it turns out that this dvd player is in fact a p os stay away from this subpar tv 
overpriced confusing software misleading advertising poor technical support i am a photographer i wanted a device that would help me match my computer monitor display to my prints this device does a good job of calibating your monitor but does nothing to help you calibarate your printer the software that ships with the device has many options of which most are greyed out for instance options for calibrating your printer are greyed out why the heck show the options on the screen if they are not included in the product ! when you call tech support you get a response in about hours an overbearing jerk explains that printer calibration is not included in the product but you can buy another product for several hundred dollars more which will address that the same company offers the huey for about half the price of this device you would expect for twice your money you would get twice the value right wrong ! as best i can tell the huey does everything this device does and more this device cannot monitor ambient light which is a feature of the huey the device has two modes for calibrating simple and complex simple works pretty well complex is useless i have tried to use the complex option numerous time and have never obtained any better luck than with the simple approach 
docupen all looks no serivce this letter is a summary of my experience with planon for the past months it all began innocent enough i saw an article about the docupen and saw immediate possibilities for potential use over the summer of i was going to order the docupen pro for i was going to have great use in my teaching environment with worcester state college as well as becker college both located in worcester massachusetts from a technological perspective i was intrigued so began my research of trying to learn more of the product i searched the web for reviews personal opinions etc and well all in all things seemed positive minus the software interface and the fact the system shuts off after every one page scan anyway in early august i decided to order a docupen even though on the website it said orders were taking weeks to fill i called sales and was told that do to manufacturing delays it was going to be closure to weeks for fulfillment or i could just call back in september when the docupens are to be in i placed my order on september for a docupen rc pro standard color order number xxxx now all i had to do was wait two weeks went by and no word from planon in regards to the status from my order now school has been in session for a week now but that is ok when i called i am told that the shipment didn t arrive do to manufacturing difficulties at this point i am willing to believe customer service two more weeks go by and still not response from customer service about the status of my shipment i attempt to call the and keep getting the answering service i tried on line chat support only to find out that an order that was suppose to take weeks is now going to take weeks the kind lady from customer service offered me a carrying case for the scanner when it arrives i really didn t care about any carrying case i just wanted up front honesty about where the heck my scanner was and when was it going to be delivered months go by and finally the docupen scanner arrives was it worth the wait no ! in total the delivery time took over months in such time i was able to find another product that better met my needs for the purpose of scanning documents even though i had decided to purchase another product i was still looking forward to using my planon docupen all i have to say is that i was sorely disappointed at the scan quality the poor software options and overall experience for planon so with no hesitation i requested to return my docupen under the day money back guarantee was that to be the end of my frustrations with planon no here is a time line of various correspondences in the attempts to get an rma and refund issued december initial request for an rmadecember i receive standard rma proceduredecember all required questions from rma questionnaire have been answered and emailed backdecember receive rma sheetdecember send back docupen according to planon specifications with tracking and signature confirmation emailed rma department to inform of statusdecember receive email from rma rep saying that they will be looking out for the packagedecember receive email verification from post office of signature confirmationjanuary i email rma rep to find out statusjanuary i email rma rep again to find out statusjanuary i receive an email from the rma rep informing me that the package had indeed arrived and that the credit would be issued in daysjanuary i still have not received any verification or communication that my credit is being processedjanuary i call planon and have the following conversations called planon today i spoke with a harmony from customer service i was told that april mcknight is the credit manager apparently the credit manager has been out of the office for the past week though that doesn t explain the email from nick on explain that the credit will be issued in days here over two weeks after that email apparently the credit is still sitting on april s desk i was told by harmony that it will be taken care of this week so i have been more than patient in regards to waiting for reply and follow up from anyone from planon every time i contacted someone about the request for an rma i was the one that had to follow up times before receiving a reply to my request i have now emailed three times in regards to receipt of my returned docupen needless to say i find the product not worth the time or the money the company has miserable customer service but i should have been aware of this when i first placed my order and was told it would take weeks and it arrived months later and the product was a piece of junk 
nice output duplexing is poor i like the output from it and the networking is very nice but the back side of prints are offset about inches from the front side hp s support was very bad although they did send me a new duplexer eventually which still did not solve my problem after awhile i gave up on trying to get it fixed all and all i wish i had purchased something else because duplexing is the only reason i got this printer for someone who does not care that much about the duplexing option i am sure it would be fine though 
don t like it it squeeks loud can t listen to the cd because the cassette adapter squeeks to lou 
beautiful but this phone is lovely to look at but the numbers on the touch pad wore off within months the touchpad completely ceased to function within three years of very light use it was a second phone used maybe times a week the receiver cord is extremely short 
waste of money i thought i could save money by printing some photos on this less expensive matte photo paper big mistake quality is so poor that i m ready to just dump it can t figure what else to use it for 
will not help with car stereos i cannot help but wonder how this device helped two other people who used it on car stereos car cd players have a front loading mechanism as opposed to a tray or top loading and the instructions specifically say not to use it bacause this damages the brushes if the brushes are out of alignment as they should be after using the cleaner in the car stereo the device will do nothing for your cd player it helped a little with my cd rom but i highly doubt it could ever solve the neverending issue of a dirty car cd player 
could be better i ve come to expect a decent level of quality when i buy a microsoft product but this mouse seemed like it was just some generic rebaged mouse the main problem is when it is on a slightly uneven surface and i mean very slight or on one that is too shiny the laser won t track right i had to open the thing up and shave down part of the optics assembly becuase whoever designed it didn t test it well enough unless your willing to do that skip this one it is not of the same quality as the first generation microsoft optical mice i know everyone is doing what they can to cut costs but at a certain point your robbing peter to pay paul but then again you do get what you pay for 
does not support windows the product description says includes drivers for mac os and later and for windows me this is a lie once you get the product set it up fail to install and go to the web site it says does not support windows who knows what they do support don t buy it 
overpriced and tiny i was thinking about taking this unit to work but i don t work in a library ! the drone of machinery and my co workers radios will squelch this device s output leaving me straining to hear its contribution to the din do not doubt that this is a glorified transistor radio it s light and very portable it does have handy appliances and it is pretty it is lacking both power and substance that the price demands this radio strikes me as a gimmick gift for opening a bank account or filling out a credit card application 
too loud as the other reviewer said the lowest volume setting is far far too loud making this a poor choice for an office desk or a home nightstand i can t even begin to enjoy the sleep function also for a travel unit the carrying bag provided is not big enough to hold the base unit the ipod and the charger all in all a nice design and look but these two flaws especially the volume issue put this unit directly into the return pile 
buy a laser fax instead i was suprised and dismayed to learn that this brother fax is among the most popular fax machines amazon sells the print and copy quality are inadequate the machine shrieks in an especially tiresome manner and the overpriced ribbons need frequent replacement even at the highest resolution setting recipients of my faxes complain about not being able to make out even typed text the dusty old laser fax i paid five dollars for at a garage sale takes much longer lasting toner cartridges and completely outclasses the fax the is however a surprisingly adequate phone with exceptional volume and voice quality go figure 
shipping issues order this from their website shipping there costs instead of like boxwave charges here apparently this very small piece of plastic comes in a lb box 
if you enjoy static this is the phone for you i ve had this phone for approx months now maybe longer and i truly don t know how i ve stood using this dual phone system for so long however tonight i ve taken a giant step upward towards better quality and design with the panasonic kx tg m dual system this dual handset is the worst i ve ever experienced in a cordless system from the moment i set it up the static has been atrocious step away from the base unit over ten feet and it sounds like someone gargling gravel or a mad cat hissing in your ear i can t even step into my attached garage to talk with someone without major static to the point of not even being able to be heard by the other person even within six feet of the base i receive intermittent static that becomes obnoxious and distracting not only to me but to the other person on the other end for they hear it too i will never purchase another uniden product if this is the non quality of product they put out i had a mhz system that would outshine this system and i wish i d never gotten rid of it as the title says if you desire a lot of static when you talk on a phone this is the system you need to bring that crackling symphony of music to your ear the melodic consistancy this system creates in ones enjoyment of talking on the phone will not put you to sleep but rather increase your aggravation of dealing with what sounds like a major electrical storm going on inside your head uniden should be ashamed of this product stepping down from the soapbox now 
not so waterproof initially this worked okay but after a few weeks i was swimming and all of a sudden my mp player stopped playing when i looked at the case water had seeped inside ruining my mp 
poor choice the alarms works great the radio and cd has a decent sound unfortunately i needed a clock the display can only be read when you are looking at it dead on if you look at it from any angle the display is washed in blue and cannot be read at all 
don t buy it consider another receiver before buying delorme s delorme s receiver works only with their software the receiver does not conform to any standard unlike most other receivers the delorme software itself is not very accurate just in looking at the area of a few blocks surronding my home i found instances where a facility was shown as being located several blocks from where it actually is but microsoft had no problem locating the facilities properly finally with the receiver i have even after the device as been initialized delorme s software sometimes is unable to find it i suspect that is because the cable on the gps side sometimes pulls slightly out but fiddling with it doesn t seem to accomplish much real irritating out on the road as it is when you find one of their printed atlas has been misbound and lacks several pages 
bad experience received dvd s damaged due to inproper packaging by the vendor vendor refused to exchange damaged discs 
garbage to back up my personal dvd collection i burned discs on these memorex dvd rs on philips dvd rs every memorex had flaws during playback every philips was flawless i ve been buying memorex for years but i ll never buy memorex again 
comes with a self destruct i had my pink ipod mini since feb it was fine until it died the next year on the exact day i got it and the warranty ran out i got it repaired at an apple reseller and then it died again on the warranty expiration date what is it with the ipods it s like they have a self destruct inside ! 
there are better kvm solutions besides the fact you have to buy the cables separately as others have mentioned belkin support is horrible the automated system consistenly disconnects the call requiring going through their operator my port kvm stopped functioning after six months there s no information on the web to help either it s as if there is no way to fix a kvm that doesn t work flash upgrading is a joke i followed the procedure directly from belkin s website so i had to rma replace it trust me belkin doesn t care about its customers and arrogance will be their downfall go with iogear they include all the cables with the kvm switch for the price of belkin s without cables 
will not work with printservers i bought this printer and printserver separate so at any time i could switch out the printer without having to buy another wireless network ready printer problem is the hp laserjet doesn t work with either the netgear or linksys printservers which boggles the mind my customer wan t happy and neither am i 
does not work well with my smartphone i did not realize i had to purchase a compatible map program to go with this product when i tried it on my smartphone it shut down my ability to receive calls also 
mailing was good and fast but the product is so bad i had power point presentation before and i like to purchase new one however this microsoft power point presenter was so bad it works so badly bad mouse movement it doesn t go to next slide even though push several time right in front of the receiver try not to buy this product i thought price and range was good but it doesn t really work at all by the way the seller sent me the product pretty fast and good condition 
noise canceling has no effect i ve tried a few varieties of noise canceling headphones these have no actual noise reduction that i can determine in any environment they do tend to amplify the volume a bit and are clear in terms of sound quality if it s noise cancellation you re looking for this model is not for you i hope i can return them for at least a credit on another model 
it won t work i have a corded usb wireless antenna from linksys that keeps falling off the table so i thought i d give this great new wireless card a shot i got it today and all the things the other reviewers said is happening to me also it connects and then automatically disconnects i tried not using their driver disc and letting windows xp set it up like the linksys one did and it forces me to use their driver which won t work im sending it back 
you get what you pay for these are headphones there s nothing amazing about them in my opinion i bought them to use with my ipod when i m out or at work right out of the box i was disappointed with the fit and i know everyone is going to be different but for me they just aren t comfortable the sound quality is clear but very thin and lacking bass even when i m pressing them into my ears to get the best possible fit the bass just isn t good eq settings to boost the bass don t help either and often reduce sound quality even more the ear clips don t really seem to do that much either they kind of keep them on your ears but don t really hold them in your ears at all the ear pieces tend to get tangled together easily as well in summary i wouldn t recommend these for music but if you want a cheap pair of headphones for listening to audio books or some other kind of spoken word they might be good if you can tolerate them in your ears for that long 
not everything read the plan carefully not everything is covered under this plan they will use any excuse they can to say that the product broke under unusual circumstances so they don t have to pay too many exclusions for an everything is covered policy don t waste your mone 
confusion reigns n ew and it seems amazon have no idea of why there are three prices for the year plan the only solution that i could find from other reviews is possibly based on the price of the tv ie when you check the price of a tv and scroll down to the bottom of the page the price of the and year warrantees will be different for each tv based on that price select either or years warrantee and add to your cart 
extremely poor choice connecting the server was easy installation of the utility software no sweat too although when it came to setup the server control panel repeatedly asked for a password since i didn t set one it must have been set by factory calling the tech support did not resolve the matter returning to the seller 
bad product i bought this sd card from j r music last week i thought i would get the authentic card from pny so i just used the card with my camera and threw the package away a couple days later i took the card out to put all the picture in my pc and realized by that time the card is only gb i contacted the customer service department and they said they won t deal with me unless i have the original package which i don t anymore they adviced me to contact the pny store so i did a little research and found that the exact same card is from toshiba modelsdmog and j r or whoever their suppliers are just put a pny label on it to sell it as a pny if you don t believe me just type toshiba sd mog on google and the picture is exactly the same except for the little lable i really don t care if the card is made by toshiba or pny as long as it is gb but it isn t and that would make it really tough to recover your loss from any party pny toshiba or j r i already contacted my credit card company for a dispute little advice for everyone stay away from this particular card and j r store and also check the card validity with your computer as soon as you get the item 
terrible disappointment and waste of time this was terrible i returned after hours with tech support and days of email exchanges with apple support desk the product will probably be better with future software updates but in my experience it was fairly unreliable in its current state examples of problems wouldn t download drm managed content online had problems when downloading itunes purchased music the first time i ve had that problem in years of ipods and itunes couldn t connect to my corporate vpn and finally just as evidence of the lack of qa on this device the included instruction manuals were for the previous version of the apple extreme the images were of the previous white button shaped device this was a genuine disappointment and it seemed to stem from bad software and bad qa others seem to have had more success but i m back on my g airport extreme and all problems have magically disappeared 
batteries are supposed to be standardized i have two ni mh chargers and sony batteries won t charge in them they probably use some proprietary technology to prevent using other brand chargers they force you to buy their own non standard charger that probably won t again charge other brand batteries and of course this is not mentioned anywhere no wonder these batteries are the cheapest don t waste your money or support sony s attempt to bring non standard products into a standardized market soon we have to carry bunch of chargers instead of the good old times when just one was enough 
i won t be buying memorex any more creating a dvd using imovie to idvd even on a powermac g quad superfast supergreat is a hour process a failure rate due to poor media quality is unacceptable ! the quality control at memorex sucks it is not so much the cost of the bad dvds but there are superficial scratches on the recording surface of out of every i have used causing a failure to burn after a very lengthy set up process i will be using verbatim blank media from now on ! 
ipod speakers these speakers worked good while they worked they didn t even last a year though the sounds keeps cutting out on them or doesn t work at all probably would not recommend 
the cover scratches my macbook i bought one of these when i bought my macbook to keep it in pristine condition just a few months ago i just popped it off to clear out a little bit of debris that got caught between the cover and the macbook and find that all along the cover has been scratching my macbook they should at least have had the foresight to make the plastic in contact with the macbook of a softer material or created a design where it won t rub against the laptop really stupid design it may have protected against some very minor scratches but likely i m worse off for using this cover scratches on the outside of the cover are more evenly dispersed than those now on the macbook but both are of similar severity i don t think in the long run it was worth and i feel very misled by the marketing for this cover given the choice again i would have either gone for another brand or just saved my money 
the apc damaged equipment warrantee is worthless i don t own this specific apc product but i do own other apc products my home was hit by lightning on july during a severe lightning storm both of my garage door openers were destroyed during the strike and they were on separate net power line surge protectors made by apc net surge protectors offer the best damaged equipment warranty that apc offers apc refuses to pay for replacement garage door openers since in their determination the surge protectors are functioning properly i had to send the surge protectors at my expense for analysis at their labs i will never contend that a surge protector can protect any device from a direct lightning strike but the apc warranty contends that they will replace your equipment in the event this unfortunate event occurs i now do not recommend apc equipment since their warranty is worthless 
caveat emptor i cannot speak for all devices but this was a total failure in my case i am a fast typist and it seemed that about of the keystrokes were not picked up by my treo this was simply unacceptable so i immediately returned it i cannot determine whether the problem was due to the keyboard the software or my old pda newer faster pdas might have a better success rate but the potential for problems will still be there my suggestion is to buy this somewhere with a generous return policy so that you can return it if it is a mismatch for your pda 
expensive mistake i agree with the other bad reviews above one faviourable reviewer uses it for pool areobics which i assume dosnt involve submurging your head the other faviourable reviewer who lane swims with it dosnt state his her sex but i can only assume this reviewer is a woman who swims with her head above water as many women do to protect their hair i can only agree with the other reviewers who swim with it the sound is already muffled and those things you stick in your ear can be painful as you have to really shove them in let the water in no matter how hard you try to plug them in your ear so after a few metres the sound is almost completely blocked rendering them useless i also had the problem with the headphones though when i got a replacement pair with the lubricant there was no mention that i needed to use the lubricant to rectify that particular problem another review elsewhere mentioned you could try cutting back the plugs to suit your ears but i really cant see that this would help much if someone out there does have this product and is using it sucessfully while submurged please write a review here and tell us what the rest of us are doing wrong but until then my advice to anyone wanting this for swimming with your head in the water is dont bother 
nasty surprises i ve had the at pl turntable for about a month it worked relatively well with the included cartrdge there was some minor hum but it was only noticable with my receiver s volume up very loud with no record playing i tried installing a sure ms cartridge for playing rpm records and the problems started there was noticable hum even when playing records i also installed an audio technica atmla cartridge this cartridge gets very good reviews from audio weenies the hum was outrageous from the second i turned the thing on the cartridge works fine in my brother s old kenwood direct drive unit i tried using the turntable with the internal preamp and with the one in my receiver as well as connecting directly to my mac for cd burning the problem persists the unit will be going back tomorrow very disappointing 
on my rd cable in momths warning stay away from this terk sir ext extension cable i ve had to purchase thats right cables in months after the st died months i brought it back to best buy for an exchange was told i must exchange with terk returned to terk by certified mail never received response or exchange terk does not back this product up went to best buy purchesed another died yesterday after only months of use now i m on my way to radio shack to try out the monster sirius ft extension cable wish me luck 
connection problems i m having the same connectivity issues as the other two reviewers noah and casey we have two servers where i installed the cards running windows standard server with sp and all updates the servers are connected to com gigabit switch the connection starts just fine but it cuts off in about to min of medium file traffic and the servers become inaccessible not even responding to pings the card needs to be reset to restore the connection only to drop it again in the next minutes we tested the switch to ensure it s working and we tested the cabling as well everything seemed working fine finally we gave up and installed more expensive intel pi gigabit cards no problems since then 
basic functionality and that s about all i bought this router hoping that some of the quality in cisco s excellent enterprise market routers would have worn off on adopted child linksys unfortunately my experience has me convinced that linksys is a red headed stepchild my apologies to all you red heads who has learned very little from its adoptive parent that being said the router does work out of the box and it is probably about par for current market offerings on home network routers my perusals of the dsl reports hardware forums have left me with the impression that all sub routers on the market suffer their quirks and behavioral anomalies and this one is certainly no exception prosthis router is configured to work right out of the box you can pretty much just connect the cables and turn it on and have functional connectivity without ever looking at a configuration screen the html based configuration interface is incredibly easy to use you don t have to learn one single command line to configure this router default configuration was stealth mode meaning the router did not respond to any unsolicited connection requests forming a protective black hole on my ip for most uninvited packets consnot all of the features worked out of the box several of the links in the html command pages simply did not link to anything strange that linksys would ship the firmware without at least taking minutes to hide the links that don t point to anything turning on the poorly documented firewall feature causes the router to respond irregularly to unsolicited connection requests sometimes the router responds port closed to all requests sometimes it responds port closed to some and port open to others the set of which does not remain consistent from one trial to the next never does it maintain the stealth operation of its default configuration with firewall inactive i m not sure how the firewall in this router is configured to behave but my initial tests suggest it is more security hindrance than feature the router s dhcp functionality works great when it works it mysteriously disengages at random intervals requiring a reboot and sometimes a flash to factory defaults to remedy flashing a new bios image is risky router failure during a flash means shipping the router back to the manufacturer or file if the warranty is out for what it s worth i am still using this router it serves its basic purpose and while its functionality issues are annoying there are workarounds for all of them i probably will not buy another linksys but the problems with this one aren t annoying enough to warrant a return sean hennin 
perfdormance of audio technica at pl belt drive turntable there was no problem with the turntable except the sound was very poor distorted and muddy i thought it had to be the cartridge and so stated in my reply to you i thought perhaps you would provide me with a new cartridge instead i was offered a discount i could not tolerate the sound so that was not acceptable i have quite a collection of records and s some of them are in fair condition but the reproductio was very poor i have ordered several items on the net and that was the first return so i don t think it was my problem thank you robert sander 
very disappointed i purchased this radio because our favorite smooth jazz station became a hip hop station and we learned that the smooth jazz programming was available on the secondary digital channel however we could not get the second channel to work with any consistency it worked in the kitchen but not in the bedroom where we had intended to use it another reviewer has commented on the user unfriendly setup process and i second those comments totally but the deal killer for me is that it just can t pull in the stations i tried everything it just doesn t work very well at all we live in suburban dallas im sending it back i never send stuff back but this was really unsatisfactory 
not a quality product at all first off the company i work for ordered three of these one out of the three did not work there is no sound comming from the right side and it isn t the speaker as we have tried different speakers amazon will not take it back and will not exchange it for another one this is just the start the two that do work work very poorly the connecotor for the ipod is very flimsey and feels like it will break off they give you inserts to use depending on what model ipod you have these inserts prevent the ipod from sliding all the way down so when you use them the ipod will not work also the cd player has a lid that opens with a motor yes a motor so if you push it down when it is open it will close but this throws off the gears as it is very sensitive and now the damn things don t close all the way you need to use the open close button to prevent this but natural reaction is to push the lid down when it is open all of the buttons are very clumbsy and confusing the sound is not that great at all ! there are a ton of wires with this thing power speaker antenna and ipod firewire type connector all run between the speakers subwoofer and main unit this is not a good product and has been a nightmare for my department 
when it plays it s fine but poorly designed and counterintuitive i have several issues with this player the case open slider is along the side of the player is situated where the cords come out and it is difficult to open the player as a result the buttons are too small they seem designed for infants or people with abnormally small fingers it will sometimes shut itself off for no apparent reason i will turn it on then wait for the first track and instead of playing it it will sometimes shut down if i hit play twice in a row it makes a continuous high pitched beeping sound that is at the actual volume level it is unnecessarily loud and obnoxious the velcro is not very sticky and so far has failed to adhere to the dash i plan on using minute epoxy to affix the velcro patches the fast forward will only go at what seems like x meaning it takes longer than necessary to speed through a track overall this design gets an f its quality is well below what i would expect from sony it actually plays the discs fine but it usability is severely limited by poor design choices addendum now it won t play at all the tape adapter apparently is broken although i cannot see where my car tape player now rejects it at least i can still listen to regular tapes 
blue screen i ve just purchased these cables guiding myself on the good reviews i set up the dvd and tv and to my surprise the movie looks blue i feel like i m watching the smurfs if i try different combinations i get black and white red and blue i connected the cables correctly so i don t know if my cables are defective or whats the problem and thanks for robinw who pointed out the problem robinwive experienced this problem before it s actually caused by the dvd player not the cable by changing your dvd player s output into component output its somewhere hidden in your dvd player s menu should solve this proble 
sony stick you at every opportunity zero stars i paid for a voice recorder and couldn t find the cd when i replaced my laptop you d think sony would offer a download or replacement through support but no you have to buy the software all over again the recorder is now useless because of their proprietary format but i ll be darned if they are getting another penny of my money and they shouldn t get a penny of yours 
sorry big step back service from amazon was great better than expected this antenna however was useless to me standard omni ant gave to bars my db omni ant gave solid bar reading this one went from bar to complete loss of signal when aimed at source and peaked i had hoped being directional would help 
a nightmare ! don t buy from electronics expo a nightmare ! don t buy from electronics expo ! the st sharp lcd tv was late had a smashed hdmi dead pixels the replacement tv had even more dead pixels electronics expo sharp amazon visa all gave me a horrible time no respect so i am stuck with damaged tvs now still fighting for a refund my advice to all get a sony from a local store for perfection no worries 
cleaning machine didn t repair the machine does fine for quick cleaning of your cd sdvds i can t give a complete review of the product because i only tried to repair dvd and it did not repair it 
poorly made i have had this unit for just over a year beware that the cd tray is in front and it slides in and out because of this design it is prone to misalign the cd which will either not load and the no disc warning will show or when it does play there is a significant vibration to try to remedy this i had to wedge a piece of folder paper inbetween the disc drawer and the unit ! alas i just got tired of not being able to play a disc for my daughter at bedtime it is now time to spend a bit more and get a better product such as a sony by the way the buttons are cheap and the overall construction is poor 
ok for short periods i have used this mouse for months with my laptop look feel and general use are fine for short periods of time lt hour however i am currently shopping for a replacement as this mouse has one problem intermittently after clicking doubleclicking the mouse will go into a move to the left mode and will continue to move until it reaches the edge of the screen sometimes it will move to the upper left this is so inconsistent as to be unpredictable i will often at least times in a minute period have to give the mouse a wiggle to stop it from continuing frustrating if you are trying to click through a multi level menu for instance another example is if you working on any cad type or image editing project where you need to insert a line one segement at a time mouse will move when it feels like it it was ok for a while but now it is annoying going to buy a replacement if i have to buy a replacement for a product because of how the product performs at an early stage in its life it gets no more than stars it could be just this one particular mouse but then that points to lack of qa at the manufacturer end again stars 
part doesn t work this part doesn t work because i put it on a hi def monitor and it wouldn t come on 
item was not the item was not as it was stated to be which was a disappointment for use in any vehicle it does not have a suction cup mount it must be fasten with screws i made use of in one car do to not being sent what i ordered as listed in desrciption most likely not buy another product richar 
disappointing i bought of these drives to set up a raid array mirror and one of them continuously has errors causing the array to be degraded i called tech support and they said these drives do not support raid big let down i have to go for the server version which will end up costing much more 
my book pro ii external hard drive disappointing the drive is very noisy when you reboot the drive runs with the fan on high then shuts down i would not recommend this drive to anyone 
beware of epson planned obsolescence i will never buy another epson product after my epson stylus photo rx died exactly years after purchase this was a lightly used machine for household purposes only i believe epson pre programs this obsolescence so that user is told parts inside your printer have reached the end of their life there is no toll free number to call no literature given at time of purchase deals with this event very very disappointed with this manufacturer 
firewire connection was messed up i bought this hoping it would cure my busted superdrive on my g imac but when connected via the firewire it would freeze any program i was using to burn cd s or dvd s i thought it might have been a messed up product so i returned it to lacie and got another one but the problem still persisted i then thought it was my computer but the firewire ports worked when connected to my old ipod and even worked when connected to my lacie external hdd finally figured that the product was defective after i purchased the sony drx dvd burner and that burner worked perfectly when connected via firewire this product however worked when connected on the usb port but the burning speeds were so slow that it was just about useless 
not for all xmgo radios i have a pioneer inno and expected these to work based on the claim works with all xmgo radios but the packaging when it arrives says it is for myfi radios and it has different connectors the product page here doesn t say delphi myfi it says xmgo which inno is sold as the product itself probably works fine for the sets it is designed for the star is actually a complaint about the amazon product description 
this is the worst phone i ve ever used it was time to get a new cordless phone and i bought this because it was on sale and featured hard number buttons i find it more difficult to dial phones with soft squishy buttons bad decision you can t hear anyone even with the volume set to maximum the answering system is just as bad in terms of registering voices and apparently no one can hear me i plugged in my headset to the jack and they can hear me but i can t hear them there is static everywhere you can t use it in range of fluorescent lights tvs computers speakers etc in a small house with compact fluorescent bulbs everywhere try that ! this phone is worthless and if i can return it i will 
limited range several issues i paid about shipping for this at compusa net or so it s probably worth about total i get about an foot line of sight range the griffin faq on this mentions two issues rf interference with mhz devices common in home security systems and some phones and battery issues they suggest testing the range away from interference and then swapping battery i tested away from interference and got the same results then i took it apart its not designed to be opened and found the battery was cemented in i called tech support and got a message they were in a meeting i tried submitting an online message and got a server malfunction error from their server id recommend this device for use in automobiles and motorbikes it would also work on a bike but riding a bike with impaired hearing is illegal in some states and should probably be illegal everywhere 
not worth it i purchased this item jan it has already quit recognizing any of the items plugged into it my usb printer went beserk when i plugged it in never could get a page to print so i direct connected into my laptop and all was fine now my camera dock and pda are not recognized i have contacted the warranty people via email told me to call contacted belkin and they gave me an rma to return the item 
not universal bring your own screws construction quality of the mount seems good but it is not universal out of the box despite being listed as compatible with my sharp aquos lc gdu on the manufacturer s website it does not ship with compatible screws to attach to the television the directions list incorrect screws that are too fat while the ones that actually do fit into the tv are too short or too long i d recommend trying something else rather than relying on this product s questionable compatibility info and directions 
cords come out too easily the usb and power cords come out very easily which ends up being dangerous for the hard drive file system the power cord kind of sags in the socket 
eugh yuk some of you guys must have some crummy soundcards installed on your machines if this widget sounds better than your stock unit in theory of course the aa micro should be the business it s a dedicated d a or d d unit as far as i can tell but the transients are terribly produced no solid sound stage i m also hearing added noise and i m not expecting audiophile quality either ! i m using a mid range pair of sennheisers on my ibm x thinkpad seriously the installed sound card is quieter and does a far better job i tried a variety of apps musicmatch mediaplayer audition with the same results the noise is not constant so must be in the conversion stages instead of interference wanted to love this but it s rubbish
