sony cne the hour battery life of this portable cd player is only one of it s many features i love mine and use it daily 
works like a charm the mount is very nicely designed it holds the treo securely yet allows the phone to pivot easy to remove from the windshield so no one knows it is in the car 
endless music i got this for my husband for christmas it was a huge hit ! the price was amazing and it is like having a juke box for a stereo it holds cd s we hit random play when we get up in the monring and never have to touch it again for the rest of the day worth every penny ! i really thought that there was a typo on the price the deal was so good if you love music you can t go wrong with this item 
good buy works like a charm produces labels quickly and flawlessly only drawback is the operation is not intuitive and reading the operation guide is necessary to work out the formats this comment is typical of a geek like me who only reads instructions as a last resort 
good product good price this works great for me ! i love it i watch t v on my computer all the time now 
can t go wrong with batteries seems nowadays everything uses aaa batteries or aa batteries making this pack perfect for just about anyone that needs them you know who you are the ones with the video games remote controls clocks and whatever else you need expecially good to get during the holidays you should never be without 
bang for your buck well i needed some new headphones i tried the ur from koss the sound quality was alright but they could barely be heard i found these thinking sony would make headphones with better and louder sound i was right the good news is that the sound quality is excellent sony headphones always seem to have more punch than other koss rca panasonic and other brands of headphones the bass and treble are clear and bass is pretty deep as other headphones i ve tried i would have enjoyed the headphones that came with my player slsv but they were uncomfortable and i mean very these are pretty comfortable and lightweight as the box explains the bad news is the overall durability of these headphones which is a big minus i ve been though two of these yet the third ones haven t broken yet at all keeping my fingers crossed the price is very reasonable and very cheap and i wouldn t have a problem buying another pair because of their cheapness overall these headphones add a punch to your music and the volume is loud for those quiet cd players 
i love my baby sweet sweet sounds come out of such a tiny speaker it s incredible this is the best record player you re sure to come across at this price the audio outputs all work like a dream and the sound modulating knobs are fun i love it go buy one 
liked it so much we bought a nd one i ve had my pair since christmas and use it everywhere ! we all know the earbuds that come with the ipods are cheap sort of ridiculous considering you pay so much for the ipods they could be just a little bit better my oem earbuds started giving me problems about weeks into owning my ipod these earbuds eliminate white noise and static and rounds out the sound for a crisp clear sound i can have my volume all the way up and my eardrums are not rattling i do listen to a lot of bass rich music we just bought a nd one for my husband and felt it was well worth it you will always have someone that is unwilling to part with the money and feel that if they do they are going to find something to complain about it s all a part of their vicious buyer s remorse cycle i use mine at the gym and they play their music pretty loudly not to mention the sounds from the various machines and weights it completely blocks out all of those other sounds so i can concentrate on mi tunes othe earbud covers do take some adjusting to finding the one that best fits your particular ear is not too difficult considering they provide you with different sizes bose customer service like the quality of their products has always been top notch i see these on sale for under on a regular basis buy it you ll love it as long as you are not a card carrying member of the buyers remorse club 
targus laptop backpack good product could be better organized the pockets need more closures or zippers 
fantastic performance for the money in the months i ve owned this router it s handled everything i ve thrown at it without even a hiccup dsl vpns qos heavily configured spi firewall filtering bittorrent xbox live etc etc and unlike some other manufacturers i could mention d link continues to release regular firmware updates improvements for their products the dgl has a very small footprint generates next to no heat and its leds are blue and very bright i guess the only word of caution i d give is that it lacks a cli administration is done via a set of built in http flash pages accessible from any web browser personally i much prefer this gui interface no cryptic command lines to learn but more hardcore network telnet types may object to it and btw if someone is having the exact same problem with three different brands of routers their routers obviously aren t the problem 
gb card i m afraid i don t know a lot about this technology i went for economy and i am getting very good quality photos i think i would have liked more speed in taking successive shots and i really don t know if a different flash card would have made a difference or if the camera is slow its still faster than my old one so i m generally happy hope this is some hel 
worked as expected pleased with purchase the reader worked as advertised i m very pleased with the purchase 
satellite radio indoors the kit arrived complete and it does what it says it will do i had a little trouble finding a window with good reception and i m not really happy with the black wires snaking across the floor but i can use my satellite radio indoors i run it through a stereo system and the sound is really good it would be great if this could be done wirelessly 
great speakers for surround i use these speaker for surrounds in my home theater system they are paired with jbl e front satellites jbl e c center jbl e p sub and a yamaha rx v av receiver ampgreat highs treble is detailed clear and crisp midbass is punchy for woolfer and the midrange is clear and clean imaging is also good i have a jbl e sub and have not listened to these on their own full range so i don t know about bass response outputi bought these to match timbre the rest of jbl northridge e speakers in my surround system and becuase of the off white color to make them blend in more with walls celling plus they come with mounting hardware these make great surround sound speakers if you have other jbl speakers or not bottom line these speakers sound good look good indoors or out and are easy to mount a great buy 
excellent lock the kensington microsaver ds lock is really good right out of the box you can tell its very strong and i feel confident this lock could stop all but the most determined thief from walking away with my laptop given a good amount of time and the right tools any lock can be broken notebook locks are in effect a visual deterrent you re average pick up and go with your laptop thief wont bother with trying at it they ll just move onto something easier the lock design is really good much better then the classic design that has videos all over the internet showing how it can be picked with such high end objects as a piece of cardboard from a toilet roll or a hollowed out ball point pen the rubber surface where the lock comes in contact with the notebook is definitely a plus won t be doing any damage to your notebook the lock itself again feels and is strong definately something you want to look into i spent a lot of time comparing this to the regular microsaver one as well the ds is worth that extra i paid for 
labeling tape i use this tape on all types of surfaces it sticks well and is easy to read 
best wireless keyboard i ve used i got this keyboard about a month ago and i ve been using it regularly since it s very nice compared to other wireless keyboards because it s symmetrical so you can put it in your lap and type on it there s no numeric keypad sticking out on the right if you re a heavy numeric keypad user this will be a problem for you but if your life is spent more on the home row it s really nice not to have all that extra junk off to the right the reason i rate it four stars rather than five is that the function keys are a real problem i occasionally hit them accidentally because they are proximity capacitive sensors rather than actual keys i d rather they weren t there at all however after using the keyboard for a month i hit them much less often so if you like the feel of the keyboard in general as i do this is probably not a deal killerim using it with my mac running osx the osx driver doesn t support any of the extra features of the keyboard other than the volume control and mute button so for example the trackpad doesn t work this is unfortunate but i can definitely live with it the mouse is heavy and i don t use it much because i prefer a trackpad but it does seem to work well with the mac the recharging station is a nice touch i wish the keyboard was also rechargeable one thing to be aware of with this keyboard is that there s a learning curve for using it and if you type dvorak style you can t switch the keycaps around because they re kind of smeared into a crescent which means that some of the keys at the center of the keyboard are sized differently than the other keys for me it took a day to type well on it and when i ve been typing on my laptop keyboard for a while going back requires a bit of re learning but if you type a lot and the features of this keyboard generally appeal i don t think this is a barrier to using it all in all the nicest keyboard i ve tried in a long time ted sez check it out 
like little hard drives rewrites possible considered better than rw s rewrites panasonic recorders are highly rated along with their plasmas i have a panasonic eh workhorse g hard drive and i like these ie my hard drive is full meaning it s time to erase for the budget minded this is the way to go not every recorder uses dvd ramwell priced at amazon check out the good deals on panasonic recorders 
works great i own a sony dvd camera and these work perfectly i ve had no problems so far and price is great 
dvd space saver i really love the space savings of this storage system although the disc capacity can be misleading the capacity includes slots on the inside surface of the cover billed for easy access to favorite discs but also handy for storing a multi disc set or two each of the pages of pro sleeve storage has two storage pockets on one side easily holding a dvd case insert or or with folding a dvd box liner on the other side of each page there are slots to store discs the design works well for keeping a dvd and bonus disc together with its package insert on each half page with capacity for dvd disc sets using this arrangement the soft rubbery material of the pages hold the discs snugly the two slots on each half page are of different depths with one covering most of the disc s surface and the other covering about half the shallower pockets allow some of the disc label to show making it easier to see which disc is in which pocket the binder system allows individual pages to be removed and re inserted but the design makes the process cumbersome plastic straps pass through two slots in each page and lock into the binder removal or insertion of a page involves unlocking the system unsnapping a heavy snap a potential breakdown area with repeated use and withdrawing the straps from all of the pages between the lock and the desired page then reinserting the straps through all of the other pages before locking the system again extra pages are available for purchase in sets of making it a little easier to re organize contents even though i have packed some of the pockets with layers of inserts there seems to be room for several more pages in each case an older version of this case had a space in the handle for a label allowing multiple storage cases to be marked for range of contents for example but the current ones do not all in all the system allows for compression of dvds and packaging in about one fifth of the space 
it s great having three these motorola telephones have good looks sound quality and range it s great having three phones placed around the house with only one main base my only complaint is that they are a bit on the small side and that takes a little getting use to as always amazon s price was the best 
can t beat the price and quality great item ! must have ! i got a fix from at least satelites in under a minute extemely accurate even with only sats works with streets and trips iguidance street atlas and after some tweaking nroute too ! d i stongly recommend this product even if you don t travel much this can get you out of a jam in under seconds flat time is money and this gps will save you a lot of both 
onkyo tx srs channel receiver i was looking for a low cost receiver with surround sound capability for a vacation home i have never purchased any components from onkyo before but a friend of mine more familiar with audio components recommended it the price was very reasonable especially after amazon recently reduced the price to just over the receiver was shipped from j r music world the packaging was good and everything arrived in good shape the directions weren t great but having set up systems before this was not a tremendous hurdle once the unit was turned on though the actual setup of the speakers and other features was much simpler and much more effective than the unit i have in my primary home it was really a snap to get the speakers configured and balanced the sound quality is excellent i don t have a sub woofer hooked up yet but the compensation by the unit is excellent and the sound quality is still top notch it does not have many of the bells and whistles of other units and it is just a system but if you re looking for a basic unit that provides all of the necessities good sound quality and ease of installation this unit would be an excellent choice 
great choice i did a good deal of research before i chose this mount i was not disappointed ! with help from my year old son we had no problem assembling and mounting this puppy the lag bolts are more than adequate for mounting to the wall final mounting is solid and the articulating arm and screen tilt feature make this ultimately flexible for viewing from anywhere in the room i mounted this in a corner and get plenty of clearance for maneuverability recommended this mount to a buddy he ordered it and is very happy with it 
works bought it looks to be very high quality lower price than canon s all camera should have a uv filter to protect the lens this is a must ! i take lots of pictures near the ocean so salt spray will end up on the camera s lens you should avoid cleaning the camera s lens as much as possible to prevent lens scratches clean only the filter you can also hold on to the housing as sort of an handle when moving about cons except for telephoto adapter blocks the flash on bottom right portion of picture if sunlight should get into the adapter you could end up seeing the metal part of the camera s lens reflected off of the filter on your pictures maybe a lens hood would help but they don t make one for this adapter maybe painting the adapter black on the inside would help reduce flare amazingly good quality for the price all cameras should have provisions for installing a lens filter it s a crime that almost no camera manufacturer do this guess they want you to replace the camera rather than the filter 
an outstanding dvd player with an outstanding price tag the sony dvpncv was purchased to replace my aging dvd receiver unit that was beginning to fuss i ordered this new dvd player from amazon and had it in less then a week from first glance the unit seemed of very sturdy construction and was surprisingly light for its size and features setup was very straight forward and easy to comprehend once completely setup i popped in a dvd and although it took a couple seconds longer then other dvd players playback was immediate and flawless the unit can also be controlled by my sony str de remote with no programming right out of the box so now i can control both with one remote much to my wife s delight all in all this is an excellent unit for its price especially being able to utilize discs in the carousel and mp playback i have not found one movie that has been backed up that will not play i would reccommend this unit to anyone 
hdtv review sony kdl s overall i am very satisfied with this hdtv set i am very pleased with it s ability to receive over air hdtv broadcasts every local station is strong with only an old fashioned set top rabbit ears with uhf loop that i have set on the floor behind a chair near the set i think the sound is a little flat and i don t like the glare off the screen and the gloss black band across the lower part of the set however brightness is very good and dimensional depth of the picture is outstanding some shows like the pbs hd broadcasts have a d look to them this is the main reason i bought sony another surprise was how good dvd movies looked in widescreen format the progressive scan feature of the dvd player produces an image that is excellent on this screen if i could ask sony for one thing it would be to provide some way to adjust the set controls for normal zoom wide and wide zoom films shown in widescreen format over regular cable i have dish cannot normally be adjusted larger without cropping more of the image than i would like this might be a problem with most sets but sony could provide some tweaking here 
works with win my biggest concern when looking for a card reader was that it work on my win not se machine ive only used it with compact flash but it reads and writes several brands and capacities just fine no install problems either even though the machine os is pretty old the pop down door is a little goofy but i just stick a pencil in the door to keep it from closing this props it up on the desk so it is a bit easier to get the cards in and out 
sony bean i just ordered the second one for our family it s the rd sony mp player to join our househould they ve been very dependable and they re easy to use the software is simple the sound is great and the batteries hold a charge for an incredible amount of time my teenagers girls love that they come in colors and they re different than what most of their friends have mom loves that they re affordable 
hd lcd tv didn t appear that i made the right choice when i first installed it out the box but after a few adjustments i ve been very pleased ever sense great tv for the price 
great watch what about a light totally love this watch wish it were fancier but why not put a light on the dial i always have to move into light to find out what time it is at night or in the dark a choice of bands would be nice too i highly recommend it for anyone 
complete satisfaction i recommend this item to all them who intend to buy gb memory stick for their cameras and cells 
good cheap you lose the retail packaging and get to steal gb for twenty some dollars from a reputable company i tripled the storage capacity of my smart phone with this disc is it really still a disc or is it small enough now that we can call it a chip it s a chip i say chip in either case this is another no brainer 
thumbs up item was as advertized delivered timely plus was less expensive than from apple would use this vendor again 
overall good mouse with some quirks i have been using this as my primary mouse for about a month and am generally happy i plan to continue using it for a long time the mouse is very comfortable to use and the batteries seem to last longer than i expected still on the original batteries after a month of daily use i do find a couple of things kind of annoying about this mouse the scroll wheel is hard to press down as a middle click because the wheel is not centered in its opening sometimes i end up pulling the wheel to the left side scroll instead of pressing it straight down horizontal wheel scrolling is mostly worthless and there is no way to remap horizontal scrolling to any other function the scroll wheel is very smooth scrolling it does not have notches like my old microsoft optical mouse this works fine for scrolling a scrollbar in an application but is very annoying for scrolling by page in a pdf file or zooming in google maps because moving the scroll wheel a tiny bit can throw you hundreds of pages away or zoom you out completely it would also making any game that uses the scroll wheel for changing weapons for instance very hard to play the default setup for the buttons is not what i had expected i had to change the function of the buttons using the provided microsoft software to get middle clicking to work the default was instant viewer with the scroll wheel back is the default for the large thumb button and magnify was the default for the small thumb button i had to change the way i used a couple applications like viewing pdfs in single page continuous instead of single page view but overall this is an extremely comfortable mouse and i would recommend it to anyone who won t have major problems with the annoyances listed above 
my ipod is back to new i used icleaner on my so easytoscratch nano and was very impressed with the results i followed your instructions and the screen and casing scratches came out leaving a very highly polished mirror like finish just like brand new again i highly recommend this product 
nice mount i bought this mount for my well built and strudy once bolted to the wall i had no reservations about doing chin ups from one of the cross bars i weigh lbs in a nut shell a solid no nonsense flat panel mount i also bought one for my would purchase again if i need another 
great little remote when my toshiba vcr remote starting giving me problems i decided to look into a universal replacement i don t care for their usual bulkiness so this one stood out because of its slim line design the reviews were positive and the price unbelievably low so i took a chance its even nicer than i d hoped it is slim so it handles easily it s light and the buttons are well placed its programmability and learning capability allow it to do about anything that your other remotes are capable of and you can pretty much place these functions on whatever keys you wish read the instructions first its easy i believe that the reviewer who complained that the unit was only controlling a limited number of functions had not fully read the instructions and utilized the programming learning capability i m impressed at what it can do which includes everything on my vcr remote the keys are reusable between devices that is a key that s set up for a particular function on one device is totally free for a new setting when you switch to another device mode it isn t backlit which is not a particular problem for me but might be a feature someone else needs i bought a second one i purchased the device and then bought the as the second and i can tell you that the only difference between them is the two additional device controls there are no other added functions on the but it didn t need any well maybe that backlighting thing i haven t had it long so i can t speak to durability although i have dropped it on a couple of occasions and it was unfazed it actually seems very sturdy i guess i m trying to figure out why such a low priced remote is so nice i can tif you re looking for a simple but effective universal remote or just a replacement or an extra one you won t be disappointed with this purchase 
you get what you pay for i originally bought this cd case for my car because i listen to cds the most while driving this was not a good case to bring back and forth at all it is very large and heavy even without cds ! and the long zipper tail makes it hard to open with one hand i now use it to house computer software and playstation gamecube games for what you pay it is an excellent buy 
this is the product you are looking for if you don t want to spend a ton of money and you want the best quality possible i am using the ads tech dvd express mainly as tool to put shows that i have recorded on my directv dvr onto dvd the quality is outstanding quick complaints but really these are only minor things setting up was slightly difficult because i kept getting an error message saying that it wasn t receiving a signal and the plugs needed to be more secure the message should have said make sure the usb cable is plugged in directly to your mother board in other words in the back of your computer and with a usb port that came with your computer instead of an add on easy enough fix but frustrating to get to that point and realize it was something that simple on recordings i have found a slightly fuzzy gray line at the top of the video this has no impact on the sound or the video quality otherwise but i wish there was a way to get rid of it to make a pure video with no errors this is a great product dont look any where else 
good value i have been enjoying these speakers outside by my pool for several months now and the quality of the sound is excellent particularly given the reasonable price i m sure you can get better performance but it will cost much more these speakers are a rare find in today s business world something that is actually a good deal 
targus wireless keyboard is great this is a fantastic little item you can attach your pda position the infrared wand and off you go with this keyboard you can type and also use a button on the keyboard as a mouse which is a similar experience to using a laptop mouse my only problem was with customer service which said the keyboard wasn t compatible with my pda when in fact it was 
its the best for me when i ordered this webcam i never know it would be so easy to install and use plus the clear images pictures and videos are great now i m enjoying my pc more than before the mic and headphone are so great and helpful too awsome 
its good i am enjoying the scanner only wish i knew more about how it functions so i could get the most out of it 
easy within about seconds of opening the box i was listening to my ipod on my home stereo wires are well made there may be cheaper options that work as well but these will last forever 
great style and quality but overpriced very nice style durable heavy quality construction easy tofollow assembly instructions good for concealing a v wiring this stand serves well for putting various audio components on the shelves and a turntable on the top also can be used for a tv on top and vcr cabledvd on shelves although it s a very nice product the price is much too high for what you get design is modern and a very nice additional piece of quotfurniturequot for an image concious consumer 
great travel alarm clock this product has a very good sound for its small size it also has a nice carrying case works on batteries as well as ac current there are also adapters for the various ipod sizes we highly reccommend this item ! 
a solid product i have three of these two at home and one at work the black pad tends to get and or look dirty while the silver pads look good all the time very comfortable nice support for the wrist could stand to have a little more mouse roaming space but not a huge complaint good stuff 
great product for great price it works realy great i red some other reviews before buying this product and i can only say that this product is preaty fast and does realy works and for the price i paid its even more than enought to say that its just awsome great delivery time 
mustek pl portable dvd player this has a nice size screen it only has buttons play pause and stop so if you like a dvd player without alot of pizazz this is it i was trying to figure out how you picked the different scenes and you had to push the stop button i just found this out by trial there was a few times during the dvd that it would turn into digital this would only last a second or two at first i thought it was the dvd but its done it on all three of them the volume control is on the side as well as the power button it could have a little higher volume but it was sufficient for me 
beautiful phone i was pleasantly surprised when i saw the quality of this very beautiful phone it s a bit heavy which i liked and the chrome phone looks very classy on the kitchen wall the only drawback is the low ring doesn t seem to ring any louder since we are on a farm i need to me able to hear it from outside otherwise it s a good buy and amazon offers it at a much lower price than at other online stores 
monster ultra high capacity batteries this is a great purchase i m very happy with the performance quality and time to charge 
excellent mount for lcd tv i am very satisfied with how well this swingout arm wall mount works it is very heavy duty and handles my inch hyundai q lcd tv with no problem it was very easy to install and the mounting screws provide with the mount worked great for me the mount when folded back against the wall only extends out about inches and the articulating arm allows you to position the display at various angles for viewing the premier am is a quality mount at a very good price and i recommend it to anyone who is looking for this type of mount 
great calculator it s great for chem and math great two line scroll display functions are easy to read 
i love this player for those of you who bought minidisc recorders to move away from analog tape recording this product is wonderful especially good for recording lectures voice lessons etc it works quite well with the built in mono mike or you could use an external one one of the few players that lets you record from a line input or an external mike you toggle which setting it is in the settings section i record my radio shows by plugging in the line out from the station s tape deck to my iriver for those who recorded live music with their minidiscs it s a little trickier you have to set the record input before you can t change it on the fly ive recorded live dj shows with the built in and agc on of course the booming bass distorts horribly but overall an easy record of the show very easy to keep in a pocket rather than to be obviously recording a show ive also tried external mikes with the record input turned down very low with very good results a bit of trial and error which i m still refining with later iriver products the single aa batter lasts a good long time summer school involves hour classes and i can record several days of them before battery is low if the battery runs out during recording fear not the file is saved the negatives are the requirement to go through the special iriver music program but there are now firmware updates that will change your iriver into the typical usb external drag anddrop drive files are recorded in a rec file which one then converts to a mp file after transfer to your computer i don t know how different this format is because it takes up exactly the same amout of space as the mp file but you can t trasnfer mp files off your iriver even if you made them yourself so don t think you can use this to transfer mp files from one computer to another also the molding where the line in input is sometimes gets in the way of certain plugs such as some rca to adaptors so make sure you pick one that alows it to fit in securely all the way ive had mine for just over a year now and use it every day whether just playing mps or recording classes i m only just starting to have some trouble with the on offplaypause button after so many presses it s starting to wear out but it s still working reliably i just have to press a little more precisely and pay more attention i have the g model ifp which is great i was able to record a hour radio show marathon i produced with it previous marathons required a stack of cassette tapes or minidiscs im quite happy with iriver and plan on buying from them in the future 
skullcandy bang for your buck upper end audio quality in ear phones for cheap i love being able to move and work without them falling out the accompanying sleeves really work 
wireless gaming is the best the controller is exactly like the microsoft controller so the transission is easy plus the freedom of being up to feet away from the t v and not having a cord in the way the controller works perfect 
great karaoke system this cartridge adds songs to the basic system i has a good variety of music that i like i highly recommend it 
excellent product i have two of these guys one for backups the other my briefcase going back and forth between work and home every day not a single problem plug and go i am using the firewire interface and silent my boss got one on my recommendation after ditching another brand and loves it too 
good for over years i bought this phone used on ebay about years ago i did a lot of reading before i bought it and found that there is a known issue with battery life of the handsets for everyone that has mentioned battery life there is a solution when i bought the phone the station with handsets was on ebay i immediately ordered energizer er p nimh batteries to replace the panasonic throw aways i had the battery life problem with my previous panasonic phone set but this set never dies ! my family has talked for hours on a single charge and left the handset in a few interesting places only to be found again with the paging system and plenty of battery life at hours of talk time it still shows two bars the voice quality is not the best but it s not bad either i use vonage and no one can tell that i m not on a traditional line it s definately better than any of the ghz phones out there the range is more than i need so i can t complain about it i can go to the corner of my back yard on the opposite side of the house from the base station and experience minimal static i ve gone so far as to walk to the end of our street a cul de sac and still had enough coverage to carry a conversation although it was a weak signal at that point overall i would have given the phone stars if i didn t have to provide my own batteries to make it useable 
fantastic i love these everybody always asks me where i got my cool earbuds i have bought pairs for my husband and several coworkers everyone loves theirs 
antennae up high solved my problem my signal strength increased from bar to bars when i installed the antennae stand on the wall my pc tower sits on the floor and the signal had to go thru the pc and several walls to the router this device made my connection go from very unreliable to excellent good solution for my installation 
great sound easy set up i love my samsung home theater system very aesthetically pleasing very easy setup and excellent sound the fact that it plays almost any media format has a disk changer and a usb port is such a huge bonus the tall boy speakers mean that you do not have to mount anything on the walls if you don t want to it s my first home theater system and i couldn t have asked for more cons the advanced sound setup can be challenging the basic setup works just fine though and i didn t really like how the instruction booklet was organized 
my early experiences i bought the pen scanner because i have an application that requires scanning a lot of plain text to my pc i am a two finger typist so my hope is to use the product to avoid the typing so far the product meets my simple expectations scan andstore and scan topc i have not yet encountered errors in scanned text customer service has also been excellent i placed two calls to wizcom s tech support and someone got back to me in less than minutes in both cases the errors were on my side first i thought the installation cd rom was defective but it turned out that i had to reboot my pc in order to read the enclosed cd rom i have had this type of problem with other cd rom applications second i was unable to scan text to my pc in a notepad file as instructed in the manual i repeatedly got the message error sending data to pc and panicked thinking that the product was a scam it turned out the plug to my pen not the usb plug to pc was not fully inserted once corrected it works just as expected i feel a great relief that i don t have the hassle to return the pen i am satisfied with the product 
great for travel this is a great flash reader for travel if your camera takes an xd card i would highly recommend this and with free supersaver shipping you can t get much better although a large xd card is cheap and i don t usually fill it up on my travels that doesn t stop my wife from wanting to review the pictures on our computer almost nightly it s nice not to have to pull out a multi card reader with separate cable and everything else this beauty is actually small enough to fit in my small camera bag ! another thing i don t have to worry about forgetting on our trips ! if anything this piece is actually faster than my larger multi card reader 
viking jump drive it works sweet it saves my from dragging around my laptop 
these are by far the best earbuds i have ever owned if you are looking for a fairly inexpensive pair of earbuds to replace the crappy stock earbuds you have buy these the packaging says surround sound and boy is it right to test it listen to a song that switches from front rear and left right a lot i recommend the beatles revolution and you will be astounded by how amazing it sounds it s like sitting in a spherical room surrounded by degrees of speakers it s amazing what that little external speaker can do cover it up with your finger and it s like switching back to a cassette tape ! that being said i feel like if it s windy you won t be able to hear your music at all because of wind blowing straight through into your ear but i haven t tested it in the wind yet and the quality it s the best quality that you will ever get from earbuds for less than dollars at least they sit comfortably in the ears although i do have to put them in pretty hard also if you have a monstrously large ear canal a larger tip is included there are a few oddities however the main one is perhaps that these earbuds are too powerful for their own good on my ipod i have to have the volume down at just a sliver to have it be at a reasonable level i also had to turn my wave volume way down on my computer on the other hand if you like blasting your eardrums out these will be quite useful also i ve never been a fan of the different lengths of wire to the left and right earbud i don t like the wire scraping on the back of my neck but i can definitely deal with it being in the front i saw that many reviewers hated this because of the lack of bass come on they are inch speakers ! you re not going to get subwoofer like bass from them i tried some sublime greatesthits just to test it and the bass sounds fine i think a lot of these reviewers are just way too picky bottom line this is a top oftheline pair of earbuds for dollars and i highly recommend it it won the ces innovations award in for a reason 
a wonderful addtion my son is a marine over in iraq and this was something he brought to my attention as being great to have to go with his rhino he absolutely loved it 
very happy after having a harmon kardon receiver for almost years that died a graceful death my purchase before this teac was only about years ago big mistake was the latest purchase a refurbished product from another vendor within years it had a significant background hum i really like this teac unit for several reasons i have never had a receiver with a remote and it is nice to not have to keep opening and closing the audio center doors to operate it more importantly to me is the fact that i have seen very few audio receivers that support a turntable and i have a great collection of old vinyl sometimes i like to reminisce ! for those interested my needs are for more background music so i can t comment on how it sounds amped up full tilt but overall i think this was a great value and suits my needs just fine 
great product i own a recording studio in my home and wanted to unclutter my space this monitor mount was the perfect complement to my situation sturdy and easy sraight forward install are words i would use to describe my experience i would highly recomend this product 
quite nice well done ti ! purchased for college statistics would be doomed without this only occasionally refer to the manual after having practiced the keystrokes for a day or so 
great laptop bag for an overnight trip i ve had this bag for almost a year now and i couldn t be happier with it i don t use it for college as it is a little too big for me for everyday use but then i m about feet tall this is a great bag if you re planning on an overnight trip or a week long trip and don t want to be bothered with a lot of luggage i like to take my laptop everywhere i go and this is the bag i take on my weekend trips it keeps the laptop secure and there s plenty of room for a few sets clothes and other odds and ends it does not have the plastic supporters that s shown in the picture but it does have a small partition in the main compartment which can hold a big book you can push this partition back if don t want to use it it takes the weight off your shoulders prosgreat designholds just about anythingfeels light on your shouldershas a waist strap if ever you want one can double up as a laptop cumovernightbagconsthis is the only things i can think of it s a little too big for everyday college use it might work if you re tall and like to carry all your books with you overall i give it stars because the only con that it has doesn t really bother me 
love it wow yea that pretty much sums it up ! picture quality is amazing in hd sd is also very nice as well at the price that this tv is at right if your looking for a phenomenal tv then buy this one now ! thumbs up to eagle too for having the tv here days after ordering it ! ordered on sunday and it was here on wednesday ! great job to everyone involved 
great product excellent usb performance this adapter gives us consistently excellent range and signal at least anywhere in our sq ft two story home the adapter also works with our older wrtg router which is not an srx router but the adapter gave us better performance than our other wireless g adapters already in the house which were hovering around signal performance its works great with our laptops and desktops alike 
an interesting tuner with outstanding selectivity the hdt is certainly an interesting and somewhat versatile product the interior chassis is composed of two modules one for signal processing and the other for power taking about the volume inside the empty cabinet the exterior has a bluish purple lcd display which is not dimmable and has a digital clock which does not keep accurate time as it is not locked to the hz line frequency there are direct entry buttons and memory presets for am and for fm the signal strength meter is almost useless as it varies with modulation on the analog stations the c n ratio feature on digital fm is a valuable feature and works well to determine antenna placement the remote is very small and thin but can easily become lost in the chair cushion now to the actual performance there is a very strong blend imposed on any but the best signals which causes a great loss in separation but a clear signal which approaches mono in analog the sensitivity is good but the unit definitely overloads easily in the presence of strong local signals correctable with a variable l pad but at a loss of ultimate sensitivity the selectivity is simply outstanding as a very weak distant station can easily be heard just mhz or adjacent to a local if you are looking to receive a weak station in a crowded station environment then this tuner is for you i can receive a station miles away with no interference by an adjacent local this is more than i can do with my two professional tuners on very narrow bandwith this feature alone has sold me on this tuner the audio output is very high far above the mv standard and it might overload some preamps this makes comparison difficult as the audio is x louder than other components the tuner automatically indicates the presence of hd signal on am and fm but requires several seconds to load the digital buffer the hd signal is better on some stations with improved separation and upper frequencies but on a few it is worse it would be assumed that broadcasting quality in hd varies a great deal among stations but that the tuner is doing a good job in the expansion process it definitely sounds better than satellite radio but it does not reflect the ads which indicate cd quality long distance stations frequently do not stay locked in hd and if you are on hd or hd station it falls back to analog and reloads on hd a great annoyance the tuner has many display options and even an audio spectrum none of the features have a detailed explanation in the instructions what would i like to see on this unit i would like an optical output a blend and high cut switch so i could make that decision on a weaker signal a clock that keeps time or no time display at all a more normal size remote presets on fm and on am if i am limited to a number and an am stereo hd that really works this one sounds poorly do not try to listen to a digital unit and a regular tuner at the same time as there is always delay in the digital processing i believe this tuner has many good features for the price of it is definitely the most selective tuner i own better than my kenwood kt and yamaha tx sure there are always changes we would like but i am sure that a low price point was important to sangean and i believe they made wise compromises except for the non defeatable auto blend 
perfect nano case with all the reviews about how easy the nano scratches i left the protective film on until i found the right case the next day at cc they had just received them that day sorry amazon but the nano did come from you anyway the case is certainly up to the standard of the nano itself it comes with a peel off protective strip that fits over the screen itself i have noticed the click wheel was a little slow to respond with the shipping film on it but since when this case is open the click wheel is directly accessible it works great it fits snugly in this case yet is easy to remove though removal is not necessary to charge or update the case has a felt inner lining which seems protect it and may provide some shock protection in case of falls i have used it daily for weeks with no scratches at all the belt clip is sturdy and secure the magnetic snap for closing it works great the case can be closed with headphones attached but of course to make adjustments it has to be opened which is easily done while on the belt clip as it unfolds to allow easy access this case is as cool as the nano itself and i would very highly recommend it i hope belkin makes the same case for the new ipod 
well worth the price great headphones for running ! they fit my ears perfectly and i don t have to worry about foam anymore 
painless installation vista x compatibility i was having trouble finding a compatible print server this was the first that i found that works on xp vista and vista x with my samsung ml monochrome laser printer this print server has the added benefit of having more rj jacks in the back and isn t any more expensive than comparable print servers i am not using those plugs now but perhaps some day they will come in handy day 
enoormous i have been using the same inch crt that came with a computer that died over years ago it had a x resolution and flickered quite a bit finally i decided to upgrade to this to go with my new mac pro let me just say that i am more than satisfied this thing is humongous you don t really realize how big it is until you get it set up ! the extra screen real estate is incredible i can have two normal size browser windows open side by side or one absolutely enormous browser window this is also very thin i save so much desktop space with this monitor finally my small desk is no long cluttered due to a enormous monitor that took up half the desk also the stand is kinda flimsy and non adjustable but is can be removed and replaced with a mount but the one that comes with it will suffice until that day comes i played lots of world of warcraft on my crt it doesn t look as crisp on this monitor but not only am i willing to trade image sharpness for the sheer size of this thing but one must also realize that a crt will always look sharper and crisper than a lcd much like other reviewers state the backlight does bleed through on the top and bottom of the screen but i hardly ever notice it i also have not noticed any ghosting on this monitor since i got it the colors are also very bright and vibrant i was skeptical about this upgrade at first mainly considering that i could have squeezed another couple months out of my old crt but let me tell you if you are thinking about upgrading to this monitor do it for the price you will not be disappointed 
garmin forerunner i love this device it tracks miles pace and calories i save lots of time not driving around after my run to see how far i went 
quality low priced power amplifier amplifier is well matched to my bookshelf speakers and produces a clear clean highly detailed sound 
love satellite radio i got this for hubby and me over the summer we used it for our trip to rehoboth beach and we loved every minute of it we have a tape deck in the car and used it w a cassette adaptor we had not problems whatsoever in fact it sounds much better thru the cassette adaptor than over the fm transmitter i did try it thru the fm transmitter and it was a pain to switch from one station to the next but i don t think anybody can improve upon that i had the same problem w my itrip we chose sirius for several reasons i liked the classic vinyl station my dad introduced me to that and hubby likes nascar and this is switching over in the only problem i had was i couldn t read the red lettering in the daylight w the sunglasses on but i didn t give them less than stars because of this this is the way to go plus it has a suction mount not a permanent mount also if you look on ebay someone is selling something to adapt your mount to the bolt on your car seat ! definitely go satellite the music is great and little no commercials depending on the stations 
easy to setup good signal strength the router was easy to setup and the signal strength was good 
a great buy i purchased this product years back and it is still working without any problem i use the batteries mostly for my digital camera and have no complaints so far highly recommend this product 
a solution that works i have been trying to find a way to easily carry a lot of camera equipment for quite some time i have tried backpacks shoulder bags duffel bags but none of them really worked all that well then i saw the lowepro street and field system with completely customizable pouches vests belts and accessories it works great you only get the pouches you need so there is no waisted space and you can organize them however you want according to how often they are used put frequently used items in easier to access places the variety alone of this system is worth the investment but the quality and ease of use is also very high which is a big plus you can get a case for any lens camera body or accessory you have i even have cases for my cell phone and water bottle one word of caution be sure to measure your lens with the lens hood on backwards if you use them to make sure that the entire thing will fit into the pouch because sometimes the lens will fit but then the lens with the lens hood will not i often carry lenses extension tubes teleconverters extra memory cards and batteries and a bunch of cleaning supplies and other gadgets which weights a ton but when they are evenly distributed on this vest belt lowepro system it is actually very manageable the only down side is that everyone will be staring at you because you have thousands of dollars of camera equipment strapped to your body but if you can overlook that this is the way to go i have used this system at many zoos without ever having problems in fact just unzipping a single lens and switching seems safer to me than opening an entire bag of equipment every time you want to switch lenses many of the cases also come with a built in rain snow cover so if the weather changes all of your equipment is not destroyed you can also put just a few pouches on a normal belt when you are just going to take photos in the back yard or don t need to take all of your equipment which is nice i really can t say enough about how much easier this makes traveling with a lot of equipment if you have been hopelessly searching for a better solution consider this you won t regret it 
my favorite storage solution i would like to second aaron s review i ve also had a hard time finding these maybe it s an east coast thing i use them to organize my music cd s my computer program cd s and my hard drive back ups the comments regarding the lack of space for liner notes are true but that s not an issue for me personally i find them very flexible cost effective and space saving i m pretty excited to see them here at amazon 
it s a porsche sleek and fast with some extra s i bought this external unit for the lightscribe technology and it works great very nice appearance and runs quiet i like to make custom cd s for traveling music with the selection of songs i want to hear and the software included with this unit makes that so easy gathering songs from whatever location they are stored and putting them in the order i want then it goes directly to some very nice templates for printing a cover or booklet for the cd case and that s just one program there s also a program for seting up the label to burn directly on the lightscribe disc s it s a little harder to learn but it also has some great features i can select an image from my documents and use that as a background for the face of the cd i wish the image would burn a little darker on the cd but that s the technology and not the fault of the lacie burner i have tried burning it twice same image yep it will work and makes it a little darker takes over minutes to burn at the best image and about minutes at the medium setting i m happy with the purchase from amazon both price service and delivery 
excellent hardware but has some issues moving up to the dinovo line of keyboard is quite a financial commitment for most users with that you expect certain things to be flawless and from a hardware design standpoint that is what you get the software is another story on initial installation the setpoint software came up after the mandatory reboot and was stuck on attempting to connect to the devices after a forced shutdown and reboot it was able to continue the setup process and found the devices to make a long story short the setpoint software became such a headache that i removed it entirely and used the keyboard and mouse without it and lost some of the features of the keyboard because of it volume adjusment media center control etc some issues occurred with the media pad in games that only allowed it to be in numlock mode but the game required the number pad to be used for navigation i actually had to buy a seperate numpad device to resolve thiss problem overall the design and feel of this keyboard media pad mouse is amazing but the software issues make it a headache to use at times if you enjoy the feel of laptop keyboards then this is a great option for a desktop keyboard pros slim keyboard sturdy feel looks great small footprint once configured correctly it is near flawless cons software issues frequent battery changes mouse needs to be fussed with in the charging cradle bluetooth connection issues advanced bios knowledge needed for control of bios system menus normal for wireless usb keyboards and mice 
works great does exactly what it was supposed to menu was a little hard to figure out but that seems to be common with stereo recievers sound is fine and the remote is nice only complaint would be that it would be nice if there was bass control on the controller so i wouldn t have to edit it via the actual reciever good for the price 
a lot of space at a great price this is a great buy because i have a lot of space i use the card on my digital camera and i take a lot of pictures without download to the computer i can go on la large weekend trip and take my pictures and download it until i m back home its a great card at a very good price 
what you see is what you get don t expect great audio quality from these speakers or any discernible stereo separation but you do get a reasonable speaker for the price 
no complaints yet this machine has delivered everything it said it would i had a slight bit of difficulty getting it set up to print according to my husband it was all me otherwise the machine has been functioning wonderfully in my busy cpa office during tax season my busiest time of year 
handy little gadget my workspace lighting is not ideal i found that my desk lamp cast some shadows and glare so i picked up this notebook light to cast a more even light on my keyboard the one downside is the spotlight effect most of the light is concentrated right below the fixture but it still greatly improves my view it rolls into a neat little coil i can tuck inside my computer bag buy it you ll like it 
ipod ac dc charger adaptor functionally this works fine compact design ac plug folds in for a smooth case easy to pack hard to damage and since there is no cord associated with the input to the ac outlet there is one less thing to lose or damage there is a usb cord from the unit to the ipod but that is it a little more expensive since it has an apple logo associated with it but it works 
ram dvds are great on suitable players after only a limited exposure on a new panasonic dvd recorder i am a fan of the dvd ram format while i haven t had time to test the stated time rewriting capability and probably won t in my lifetime i do appreciate the continuous editing capability including the ability to create and title chapters after the initial recording i can see why this is now the prefered format in japan and why it is so pervasive in europe i can only hope that it will catch on here until it does be aware that there are only a few newer dvd players and precious few pcs that can read this format 
best sonics bad ergo seems to be unanimous that this unit is great sounding i ll vouch for that compared to any i have heard even with a chinsy mini plug rca sounds damn good even compared to my super duper home player the after all it is about the sound with that said cannot see the small readout in almost any type of lighting the the push tabs do the job but its hit and miss before you learn the placement as to what does what compared to the sony which is on the average bux more it looks cheap feels cheap and sounds excellent i m glad i bought it for little money be surprised be very surprised 
unconfortable the product is well made and nice but it is difficult to put a notebook in it it fit so tight that i think it was made for another size but not it is for to notebook 
best all around lcd tv i spent a long time looking up diffrent lcd tvs this tv has it all i pc connection the speakers are on the bottom not the side its a space saver the options they give you to adjust picture quality is great the hdmi connection is great and the placement of the hdmi port is in a very smart plac 
i buy every built product i see so unobjectively speaking i like it i have a widescreen and i think i was supposed to get the sleeve because it stretches to fit but there is room for my power cord in the sleeve at airport security they really slam your computer around the texture is agreeable it s washable and it really hugs your computer but is still slim enough to fit inside a carry on bag with other stuff its expensive for what it is but they all are and this size is sold out everywhere except on amazon it s also got style which most other ones haven t and it s still practical 
i love it very fastshiping the item was good and new i love it thank you 
im is as imc when i bought it couple weeks ago i look out side the box is im but inside the box speaker is imc i call the company they told me im is as imc they said someone on the internet sell the im is all same with the imc and imc also support the ipod video too 
all s well this product contained the part i needed was delivered w in a few days and was a new product as discribed 
crisp sound with these nice thick audio wires u get great sound from this high quality connecter 
ahead of curve this seems like the best buy currently or at least at the time i purchased jan the key is the high definition x and ease of use i use it as a second monitor for my home computer to display graphics etc the graphic colours don t quite match with the other screen but i can get them pretty close i watch dvds on it this is probably what it was really meant to do i m completely happy with it 
extreme iii gb is all that extreme iii is all that for me and the family switching from raw and back so far is flawless temperatures seem to have no ill effect as long as i am using freshly charged batteries in extreme cold deg or colder no delay in summer conditions since i purchased extreme iii gb to use with my canon rebel xt camera with mp this has been the best deal for my money i could have bought cheaper cf cards i believe you get what you paid for i purchased this cf card after purchasing the sandisk ultra ii mb i only use the ultra ii as backup now and likewise this still performs excellent my opinion great price good deal 
great for the money you can t expect these speakers to sound like bose speakers but for the price they re darn good i bought them for my new imac and i m delighted with them 
great product i have had a mb jumpdrive for over years now and i have never needed anything bigger that was until i got this one gb now i carry it everywhere im a computer tech and this is the best way i can carry my software with me you can boot from the thing if you want it has enough space to run windows xp very fast and easy buy this drive you need it 
great product the macally phr af firewire external enclosure is a great product very easy to assemble plugs in via firewire and appearson your desktop just as any external hard drive would i bought two this product as a way of salvaging a couple of internal hard drives that i had previously installed as upgrades in my mac that i was replacing they have both worked flawlessly now for two months and i would unhesitatingly reccommend them to others as a great solution for this kind of situation 
great accessory for any vehicle we purchased the case logic portable dvd player case model apdv for use on a recent road trip with two young children it worked very well easy to hang from front seats would fit any size portable cd player and has storage for cd s however the best thing is probably the adaptor for two headsets no fighting over who got to listen 
improvement over stock antenna improves reception in florida for a stilletto significantly better cable worth the cost 
great for crusing i picked this up to use on a mediterranean cruise since the outlets in cruise ship cabins are scarce and usually located right at the edge of a vanity it worked great for charging digital camera batteries which wouldn t fit in the normal outlet at the same time it s small rugged and light so it s easy to pack 
great cooler comact enough to travel with this cooler works very well and gives on one extra usb port it s light and compact enough to fit in a laptop bag or backpack 
good value my car is a piece of junk but does not sound like it ! for i got great sounding speakers good decisio 
great system for your office or living room i needed a small system for my office i wanted removable speakers good sound at all volumes and a sleek look this system filled that void i searched for about a month to get it and there is nothing less than fantastic about this system even the price in terms of sound i can understand music at all volume levels many cheaper systems distort at low levels and at high volumes it sounds great i can t use it at high volumes now that i ve taken it to work but i am thinking about buying another for my living room at home run the output of my family room stereo and i ll have a system that sounds good in both places for parties in terms of looks this system is very cool i tried to downplay it by placing it behind my desk on the shelf where i keep my food so that people wouldn t question it because small stereos are allowed but not everyone likes us having them despite my attempts to blend it in i ve received several complements on the way that it looks silver casing and a sleek design are just the basics this system features a blue backlit display that looks great i thought that the dvd option in the stereo meant that you could play mps on dvd a great idea for someone who wants to never have to change cds but in fact it meant that the system is a dvd player and it has a video output to connect to your tv that s a nice plus i haven t tried the mp idea yet so it may or may not support them the stock antenna is terrible but so are most stereo antennas i ll buy a new one soon the other downside is that you can t switch between presets without the remote you can change the station but not using presets but with fm presets i ll never run out ! the only thing that wasn t obvious about the set up is that the disk buttons disk disk etc on the stereo are the eject buttons not the select buttons like most other stereos overall this is a great design for a great stereo i used to work at a radio station as the engineer and now i wish i had this back then because i could blast music in my office and really utilize the system the way it was meant to 
good sound great sound quality for the price you could buy the sony mdr earphones for around but this gives you the same sound quality for much less ! 
matte paper review great paper the epson printer worked just fine and the images on this paper were just like the photograph only thing is the price should be lower other than that this is great pape 
a good little outdated chartplotter i am happy with this chartplotter but right now i wouldn t recommend it for one thing garmin nickels and dimes you to death if you want to actually use this the memory is very expensive and proprietary you need to buy additional memory to download any charts into this device and the charts are very expensive and come with all kinds of obnoxious copy protection also worth mentioning is that the screen is hard to read in broad daylight but the deciding factor is that garmin is just now rolling out their next generation units that will replace this one i would wait the few weeks it will take to get one of the new ones which will use standard sd memory and provide bigger brighter screens etc 
awesome fast shipping great seller couldn t have asked for anything faster better and more reliable ! thank 
replacement for old sony cd player my daughter needed a replacement for her old sony d ne and this one works good with the old software as this was all loaded in the computer and set up how she wanted 
don t try another brand of dvd r i never write reviews but these dvd s are the best recordable media i have ever used i used my fair share of these discs without a single coaster even if these are pricer than other brands don t waste your money buy these no questions asked 
works fine wish the unit had a separate online offline light when power to the unit is missing the single red light turns off only when the warning sounds the warning sound is like a lot of sounds you hear in the house so it isn t always easy to tell what is happening 
beats the ipod by a longshot this is a great mp player it sounds looks and feels better than an ipod the storage capacity is huge there are only problems the screen is really hard to see in the sun this might only be with silver i don t know the software is great if you re used to it but is a little slow compared to windows media player of itunes overall it is worth more than you pay for just buy it 
perfect for your studio with the hp photosmart pro b more a review of the printer than the ink this ink is the perfect match with hp s advanced photo paper and the hp photosmart pro b 
a keyboard worth noting after purchasing of these for our educational institution i find they work very well in our classroom environment aside from being very cost effective they are small enough to fit on our bi level workstation desktops along with full sized keyboards plugged into imac flat screens the keyboards offer enough flexibility to work with all our software 
great case i recently got this case from amazon com and when it shipped to my door i couldn t wait to open the box i thought i finally got a case for my new ipod nano i opened the box and took the case out to put it on my nano it fitted just right ! it wasn t too snugly or too loose it was perfect the only bad thing about this case is that you can t charge the nano while its in the case but you could always take it out and charge it with care i m so glad they made this case ! 
pricey but for a good reason this is a great card to use for your megapixel digital camera i have the olympus c and at the highest quality camera settings i can get color shots from this card simpletech is my favorite brand because i ve never had any of their cards fail on me even after repeated washings oops this cf card is totally dependable simpletech is pricey but you re paying for quality which is cheaper in the long run 
excellent product i tried magellan before not happy until i switched to this no complaint just relax enjoy the product did its tricks u will do the same if u own one 
just what it says this is a great card adapter the user who thought it would convert an xd card to a compact flash was misinformed and their rating should be held against this product this card allows you to put your xd or smartmedia memory card into your pcmcia equipped laptop to transfer pictures etc it works great and is highly recommended for the price a rock solid product in my opinion 
this truly deserves a star it s straightforward and that is something very technological in contrast to books that give you this mindf ckng edge that makes you want an answer right away this little fan is the fan that can the can can 
timing running great everything you expect good ram to be its fast its fairly well priced and its of upstanding quality vary good stuff if you plan to be using it for animation or video game stuff right now its on a asus pw dh deluxe board with rpm drive gh intel d gtx video card over all the system looks fairly great 
works well but tricky to set up i received this unit via my home insurance after my rca disc changer was stolen the unit itself is solidly built and i don t have any issues with the playback performance or picture quality i think if you get this unit you ll be pretty happy with it what stinks is the documentation remote and setup the manual is your typical poorly translated engrish guide that most people have come to expect from inexpensive electronics fortunately if you ve had any experience setting up a dvd player there s not much different here unless you want progressive scan heres what you have to do if you want to use progressive scan mode connect both the component cables and an s video or composite cable to your tv hopefully it has both inputs most hdtvs do put your tv on the s video or composite input enter the setup menu not to be confused with the options menu and choose progressive output now you can unhook the s video or composite cable and put your tv on component input mode thankfully this is a one time hassle but it s still assinine that panasonic couldn t have either designed an autodetect or used a physical switch like my old rca had with the rca i just hooked up the component cables flipped the switch and set up the dvd player for aspect ratio and i was done lastly the dreaded h error i think i figured out what s probably causing the majority of them when you eject the tray the currently playing cd dvd is still on the motor and continues to play a neat feature for swapping the other discs without interrupting your music but the upshot is that the ejected tray has an empty slot in it can you guess what happens if you accidently put another cd dvd into the seemingly empty slot by mistake to avoid this instead of using the eject function use the swap function this will stop the playback and make sure all the discs are out of the drive and avoid damage overall a great player for the price just be careful with it and bear with the tricky setup 
works wonders diminishes volume for each set of headphones but that is to be expected extremely easy to use a great product 
dvd ram review these dvd ram disks are the only ones that record in my panasonic tv and are difficult to find in stores buying through amazon com is fast economical and the disks work perfectly especially when i recorded the super bowl to review after the game which i attended 
blu ray movie availability if you are looking for an honest way to decide which player to buy try this go to netflix and look at the number of blu ray movies that are available you will have to click on the icon and open it to see what formats are available it will tell you if it is available in dvd blu ray or hd dvd so far i have found movies in hd that are not blue ray and of the movies in my que that are blu ray maybe or of them are also available in hd dvd 
great item i bought this for sammy my nephew as a gift and he loved them i was a good buy for the money 
ultimate ipod case if want the ultimate protection for your or gb apple ipod then the iskin evo is for you a few months ago i purchased my gb video from the apple store in addition i bought the iskin evo and it has been the best accessory i have gotten so far it has kept my investment in flawless condition in fact when i cleaned the case recently my ipod looked as it did on the day it arrived there are many aspects of the case that make it a great buy and they are as follows seemless design it looks like a product designed by apple it fits so perfectly well around the unit that on occassion some question if it is the next generation of apple s ipod or some competing brand it is simply beautiful offers shock resistance with the soft rubberized outer shell it makes your ipod virtually scratch proof as once the case is on there are no exposed surfaces except for the tiny holes on the back that serve as heat vents everything is protected including the click wheel which wonderfully is not impeded by the covering in addition your screen is perfecty safe under the crystal clear hard plastic shield offers water resistance as the skin is practically air tight around your ipod to sum it up it is the ultimate ipod case portability protection and seemless beauty in one that is definitely worth the price now there a few minor critisms so minor they might not be even worth mentioning however that is why this isn t the perfect ipod case and why it got only four stars from me it s a laborious task getting the skin on and off your ipod so if you use an armband to go running it will be a little bit of a pain if you use a docking device or a cartridge device like the altec lansing im it will be a bit of a pain but that inconvience is minor in fact i stopped using my armband the case with the belt clip is all you need and will protect your ipod better than any armband on the market the air vents on the back i feel are unnecessary the ipod would be water tight if it wasn t for them but again minor the rubbery part of the case does collect dust easily yet it is painfully easy to clean finally you can t use the hold button without physically altering and cutting the skin i never use the hold button so it is not a big deal to me however it does mark exactly where you would cut should want to making me believe it would be quite easy i would give this case a if i could falling just short of the perfect ipod case skin 
great for your home theatre rear channels i bought this set just for the cube speakers which i use as wall mounted rear surround sound speakers since they are so light i think they sound great i hooked them up as my main speakers just to test and they sounded great as well very crisp sound i have not noticed any holes in the sound as commented by other reviewers and they are perfect for my home theatre i can t comment on the bass module because i don t even use it but i bet its not that great given how small and different it is from bose s other more expensive bass modules 
great to have spare battery the camera goes through battery like crazy so i got a spare one and i keep one charged at all times and it has came in handy several times if you have this type of battery i highly recommend that you have a cd one its well worth it ! 
it is a good printer i am really tired of bubblejet printer due to the ink drought very fast so i choose the laser printer this time all the functionality are working fine hope this time i can get ink power last longer than hp epson bubble jet printer 
best mouse ever i have been using this mouse for almost years now i have not had any problem with it it is small to carry around i like it a lot i will recommend it i give stars 
it really works it works clean and prefect what else can be said but get it 
soleus cfm dehumidifier i have used this dehumidifier for about two weeks and i am completely satisfied we have had an unusually humid summer in texas and this device has made my sunroom much easier to aircondition and much more comfortable i need to empty the approximately one and half gallon tank about twice a day and i m thinking about connecting a continuous drain hose a feature that is built into the cfm to the outside the cfm also runs very quietly even on high speed an excellent product 
explorist mounting bracket does what it is supposed to do can t complain till it quits doing what it is supposed to do 
well designed not perfect but very good i bought the manual select fm transmitter for my brother and i liked it so i bought this one for myself true in heavy traffic congestion i live in chicago the static is not cool but i don t see how monster could get around that i find that the auto scanning feature works quite well despite other reviews i m happy with this product and was able to find it for about 
simply amazing the picture quality of my hdtv has improved significantly after using this unit well worth the price for super high quality entertainment 
good link if you run short on cable when making a connection s you can connect another rca cable s with these female tofemale connectors they are color coded for left and right audio i use them because i am constantly moving equipment around i use them for audio but they can also be used for video if you are using rca connectors monster cable makes a high grade product highly recommended 
great mp for a great price what i like about the e is i can use the sd cards use the fast read write x and x to play music so i can have a library of sd cards to plug in i use gb ones and the prices are really coming down on the sd cards i use the online local library to check out audio books and use the fm transmitter e sandisk bought separately in my car to listen to on my way to work i modified the clear plastic case removing the snaps so i can use the clip to shirt pocket pants pockets that came with the fm transmitter ive had mine for about a year and really like the sound and yes if you turn it off then turn it on later it picks up where it left off the fm station comes in loud and clear i use a rechargable aaa battery that way it saves on the cost of batteries i use different earphones that what came with it cause mainly the right earphone gave out on me the earphones wasn t comfortable and i wanted a better quality sound i already had some good earphones so that wasn t an issue for me 
better than cutting holes in your walls i have used the plebr for an extended period of time now more than two years in fact my latest purchase was to replace a unit the newest generation of this product is an all inone unit which looks like a power brick rather than having an external power cord connected to a different unit my wife told me she would not allow me to cut holes in the walls of our home for ethernet cabling so i decided to let the existing electrical wiring handle networking chores as well setting up encryption with the enclosed cd didn t take much time and was easy to do as well if you re a network minded person who wants quick setup this is your answer 
great system but requires an investment the nike ipod system works great and without a hitch but to join the club you need a ipod nano this kit and unless you have just the right shoes either some new nike s or a third party accessory to tie the sensor up to your shoe this kit is very durable once the sensor shot out of my shoe and landed in the snow i didn t realize it for like minutes when i came back i just popped it back in and kept running the thing s really well built while the kit works i would ve liked the nike software on my computer instead of on the internet and i would ve liked better battery performance from my nano while i m running with the kit the receiver eats batteries for breakfast 
easy as shit great router ! it was a snap to setup install and run ! highly recommend it linksys tech support is great a monkey can install this thing note i didn t mention a caveman look what happened to geico when they did 
a good tool for lecture recording i purchased this for recording lectures in seminary and thus far it works quite well the sound is muddy for sure but understandable i record most lectures on the high mic setting and sp the other higher recording settings are easier to hear understand but aren t worth the extra storage space even though the player holds mb it takes up more space on your pc after converted i would like to try the recorder with a mic attachment to see the quality increase the batteries are said to last about hours and i can t say either way how long mine lasted if it was shorter it didn t seem like it the functions are intuitive to me and i figured out most all of the functions in about minutes this is the first digital recorder i ve purchased or used but i like it and would recommend it to anyone wishing to record lectures or conversations or whatever i think you would need an external mic if you wanted to record music i did so on the highest setting and it was pretty muddled not really worth listening to again 
great product the product came in a timely fashion and was exactly what i wanted i have not yet been able to fill up the memory with my camera but will try to soon 
altec lansing speaker system i bought this for my sandisk mp and it is terrific the sound is excellent i do think i will buy the subwoofer music with a lot of bass can sound a bit tinny 
great for the price these headphones look pretty cool and are more comfortable than the original ipod ones they are a little weak in the bass frequencies but the mids and highs are nice and clear for such an inexpensive set of phones also no annoying covers that slip off these will take a beating i use them while mowing the lawn excercising etc great for the 
how do you review labels hey they stick to the envelopes what more can you ask for 
expensive ink i got this printer to replace an epson that just took too dern long to warm up and print a page it was taking forever this is not much better still a lot of ink charging and jyrating before i get a page the color seems to be good but not that much more remarkable than the old slow epson no off market ink cartridges for this model so far which makes it to operate next printer i ll check the ink situation before buying 
generally ok i have owned of these phones for over years they were very reasonably priced and have worked ok for the time i have had them last week we had a power outage after about minutes i decided to phone a friend and found all three phones were dead something about the outage discharged them immediatly this is not acceptable even though they recharged i am now looking for new phones 
pack memorex dvd r not a coaster in the bunch i started using these a year back and have stuck with a winner i won t buy anything else and a bargain at that too 
fast and reliable you get what you pay applies when it comes to secure digital sandisk memory cards you can pay less but if your using the card for photography you could loose a shot if you re using a standard speed sd card with a high megapixel digital camera so the combination of speed and reliability sandisk stands behind their product with a lifetime guarantee is well worth the slight premium you ll pay think about it like this back in the day when we would pay a premium for our favorite film over and over and well with this card filmyou pay once and it keeps giving 
does what it needs to do i have only used this a couple of times but it has worked well and is fater than downloading pictures from the camera 
very impressed i grew up with a big base scanner this one is one eighth the size and picks up so much more i programmed in over local frequencies from the internet and the scan features flies through them so you don t miss much the manual may seem a little intimidating but once you know the basics the scanner will be easy to operate some of the transmissions cut off and on periodically but i live out in the boonies so that may have something to do with it i live in an area that is susceptible to brush fires and floods so this will come in handy quick delivery too by the way thank you amazon 
great player but am happy with everything about this player except that for the money spent i would have expected better support for dvd r dvd r media granted that feature isn t listed in the technical description so the mistake is mine 
excellent work great just install drivers before hardware i actualy have a wireless network and with a hawking antenna haosi and wapgx access point my neiborhood connect to my from meters more o less 
ray s review the media was recorded at a high rate of speed and the qualite of the video was great 
very fast this charger is amazing ! it is ready in minutes and the batteries last too long in my digital camera the cooler works very good keeping the batteries cool not so hot it is not noisy in other works a good item easy buy it now 
sanus vmplb universal flat panel tv wall mount bracket black mount works beautifully installation was straightforward using directions provided initially i was concerned about mounting such a heavy object on my wall which is plaster but once the mount was installed i realized just how much stability it would provide great product thanks d 
great product for mobile sound considering its small size this unit puts out some pretty good sound included a good level of bass although its not meant to lead an outdoor party it is great for a small gathering out at the beach or in the backyard while you work in the garden i love that it can easily store my ipod as well making it a nice single unit to carry around assuming its been charged after charging i ve never had it die on me and i ve been outside for a few hours with music playing the whole time the rugged case is also great it feels very sturdy and the case wont likely ever become scratched or damaged because of its tough exterior material all in all a good buy considering the quality of the build and especially the awesome sound 
excellent cooling fan except for this is a very well made cooling fan for your laptop however if you have a screen your laptop will hang off of it about an inch on both sides is about an inch and a half on both sides is that a problem no not really you want air circulation underneath to cool the fans are great most cooling boards have only an earlier reviewer said he didnt like it because the back was open well that reduces the weight and increases air circulation it is well designed in my opinion the on off switch is nice it will only work of course if the laptop is running you will never forget to turn it off it runs amazingly quiet you cant hear it but you can feel it it is really meant to keep the battery cool and help the heatsink fan a cooler working battery will last longer it has a good angle to work i really havent found anything wrong with it i highly recommend this item however if i was to make a suggestion to improve it it would be to add a couple of usb ports to it 
awesome sound i love these speakers ! the sound quality is fantastic more balanced and much richer than either the bose or apple hi fi plus you get an am fm radio for free highly recommended 
the only blank dvd s i ll use these dvd s burn well and play in all the dvd players i ve tried them in even a very finicky one i don t use a printer but the plain white surface looks so much nicer than the typical logos makes titles stand out nicely with just a sharpie 
great product like a few other buyers i ve seen i had problems with a sony cd changer that i bought surprsing to me because i generally really like sony products so i bit the bullet gave the sony to a thrift shop went online and checked other reviews and decided on this onkyo cd changer i could not be more satisfied simple enough inexpensive enough but works like a charm i would highly recommend it 
nice product nice service i could easily found amazon is the cheap seller of this product others will the same item for less online but they charge big amount of shipping and tax the product is real good and working nice with my new sony camcorder 
it s a usb cable and it works i bought this cable because it was pretty cheap cables at my local electronics store were running for over i m using this cable for my printer and it does what it s supposed to do 
these last and last i bought a pack of aa batteries for my gps about a month ago as advertised they were fully charged right out of the package i can t believe how long these batteries are lasting me on one charge i have left them in for two weeks and used the gps each day for walks hikes and car trips they just don t discharge like the normal nimh batteries i have used and been disappointed by in the past the only downside is the price but in the long run i think they will be worth the money 
works great but expensive i recommend this product does the job but one can of course get away with a cheap adapter i like it uncluttered though like this 
worth every penny the speck nano skintight deluxe w holster is everything you could ask for in a case its very sturdy durable there are some hitches though first its tough to get your ipod in at first and the screen protector was also confusing put in none of this came with instructions also the holster has a belt clip that swivels but isn t really functional unless you never need to see your ipod while its on because the belt clip puts it out of your reach i m a new ipod user so i frequently handle my ipod so this posed as a problem this case serves well for both new or veteran users of ipod though new users like i might carry their ipod in their pocket or somewhere close to their hand and this case gives you enough protection that you won t have to worry about smudging smashing banging or cracking the body or the screen of the ipod while removing or putting it in a jacket pocket ipod nano is so small that it gets lost easily in the shuffle of a pocket but the speck nano skinttight deluxe gives the nano some extra gerth to hold onto without making it cumbersome i often had concerns with accidently touching my click wheel and blasting the volume level during playback becuase of the streamlined feel of the nano but this case gives it some structure with a raised click wheel opening that i need veterans of the ipod might have many playlists which would make frequent fiddling with the ipod unnecessary and give a great purpose to tuck the nano away with the holster overall the pluses outweigh the negatives its stylish and purposeful a good buy 
brighter colors and more reliable generic refills are cheaper but the colors aren t as vivid and consistent ! i never use generic ! trust the name you trusted your printer with when you bought it hp ! can t beat the quality 
performs as a monitor too this tv monitor rocks ! ive been looking for a combo computer monitor and tv that i could use in my office this lcd does both very well i m writing this review with the lnsd installed and everything on the screen is very large what i wanted even at x and the resolution is far better than i expected hint sharpen the image and set high energy saving mode 
excellent peace of mind i started looking at network storage products after one of our pc s lost a hard drive that had some of our old scanned film images that i d never copied over to our newest pc the best thing about the media vault is it was very easy to setup all my pcs to automatically backup my photos continously we ll never lose another picture which has also gotten me out of the dog house with my wife im also using it to store all of our music which helps with some of our kids pcs that have limited hard drive capacity overall a great product and very simple to setup and use 
works great but one small drawback the drive works well and certainly as advertised it is readily accessible from the network appears to be realibale and is acceptably fast the issue i found is that despite there being two usb ports on the back for atttaching expansion drives the chipset that the devices runs off does not support addressing any drives bigger than gb so if you buy the gb wd netcenter don t bother trying to attach extra drives and expect them to be read write accessible 
just loved it cute and very useful i bought this cute little speaker from walmart and it is so compact and very useful it also matches with my other speakers of sony dream system this has usb ports so good when they stay on your desktop rather than on your pc sitiing down the table they are lighted so that you can plug them in even night speaker is good quality and it has one usb connection and one dc connection quality of sound is good if not excellent overall it is a great buy for the price 
works perfectly i bought sets of these for my entertainment center they work flawlessly i laugh at people who purchase monster cables these work just as good and if you think you can tell a difference with monster cables i challenge you to a double blind test you won t be able to tell any difference my only complaint is that these cables are very thick and hard to manuever in small quarters ie through holes in the back of your entertainment center stand if you are on a budget these are the way to go 
as expected the speakers are good quality and the amazon service is great as usual sony has always been tops for me 
good one i purchased this player recently from amazon comthis is working good until now no probs wish sony had madea cordless remote instead of corded one which makes u feeltoo many wires ! the velcro that is given to stick the unit is not great the cd player keeps falling this is a minor issue about thethe product we can use another thing to stick it on the whole good one ! 
perfect for soho remote access the linksys befvp is perfect for remotely accessing a small home network with a static ip address the connections are secure and the setup is extremely easy using tools such as the linsys ipsec tool accessing one s home network is extremely easy i recommend this product to any small or even medium sized office that wishes to connect multiple locations or support remote roaming users 
great picture great sound an excellent value i was very impressed with the quality of the picture and sound the picture was clear and sharp i was very surprised with the amount of channels that this little tv was able to receive it was able to receive all of the channels that air locally and even a few that i am unable to pick up on my non cable tv the only problem that i did notice was that when used in a vehicle it did get some interference from the engine but it was not purchased to use in a car so i do not forsee any problems i definitely recommend purchasing rechargable batteries as it is a battery eater i purchased this as a gift but was so impressed i am considering purchasing one for my self 
really makes a difference i purchased this oil with the fellowes powershred ps cs sheet confetti cut shredder and throw some in every other week or so it really works ! assuming it extends the shredder life as is claimed it s well worth the extra 
simple and works if you have a g laptop dont waste your firewire port buy this connector and you ll have two firewire ports instead of one simple and work 
good product easy to install within minutes and that s going carefully i wasn t able to intercept the hotspot near my house but when i get closer this works like a charm 
works perfectly i ve had this card for about years now and it has performed flawlessly it has seen thousands of photos no exaggeration on my digital camera and now holds data mps for my palm too did you know you can pop your sd card out of a camera and into a palm to view photos i just learned this anyway it s a nice product and i m about to get another simpletech with megs or higher if they have one if you are new to sd memory always get more storage than you need because eventually you ll buy something that will use one camera handhelds cell phones etc note that many cell phones use a smaller minisd 
it just works nothing special about it except that it just works in my nec laptop burner and in my philips dvd i am satisfied 
great product this turntable exceeds my expectations works smoothly and quietly also is much sturdier than i expected 
great phone with modern design i m not really a techie but this phone came with great reviews of interference free calling so i thought i d try it out the reception is very clear and the design is very modern and simple i often lose the phone around the house now because of it s shape but there is a button you can press to locate it the polyphonic ringtones are nice and the answering machine is easy to use it doesn t beep to let you know if there is a message but it blinks i think it would have looked nicer to have a green digital display instead of an amber one but overall a great phone 
this thing is amazing i m a cow and like most cows i use photoshop heavily all i can say is that i can not believe that i went as long as i did without this tool other reviews are not exaggerating about the night and day difference this thing makes one thing about the widescreen tablet is that it works great in portrait mode i use a dell widescreen monitor in portrait mode and i was a little worried that the tablet might not work in that configuration wacom definitely did their homework to be honest i found it to not be that useful in d max but in photoshop it s a wmd 
no complaints what is there to say its great ink i use it in my epson my only wish would be the cost being lower 
looks good does its job low cost subj well the case is supposed to carry the tomtom and protect it which it does good product low price convenient
