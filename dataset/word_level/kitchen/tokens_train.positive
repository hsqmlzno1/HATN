mini loaf pans these pans are the right size for baking individual items to take to work during the holidays 
compact and sturdy this mill is smaller than i thought it would be but works well and looks great 
great for indian food i ve used this for indian food and it worked really well you an prepare the meat and keep it on the part with the heat off before you mix it back into the masala btw i own other anolon advanced saucepots and love the way they cook and cleanup re the squishy handle if you have gripping problems as many middle age to older cooks do this helps you don t listen to the young self involved and obviously inexperienced cooks who blast this feature some day they too will develop weak wrists or arthritis and will appreciate this feature 
finally a handle fit for human beings if you ve bought fiestaware place settings in the past you ve surely noticed the awkward shape of the coffee mugs of yore the old ones had a little ring of a handle that few adults could use comfortably while the art deco design is lovely using the old mugs was miserable and not the comforting morning coffee experience we ve come to expect from no nonsense diner mugs anyway fiestaware has finally taken note and given us a proper mug with a proper handle and it s a realistic size too not like the cartoonishly oversized jumbo mug which is more suited for soup or cereal than coffee yay for the java mug 
allows my razor to perform as good as new this product is an exact replacement for the cell pack in my norelco xl electric razor replacement was a breeze and once charged the new cell pack has provided excellent performance and long life between charges just like when the razor was new

its a keeper we had second thoughts when we saw how tall these were for some reason we thought they d be taller they re feet tall and sturdy kind of roughly finished not bad works fine 
best grill i ve ever owned this grill was recommended by alton brown of good eats foodtv the grill came with explicit care instructions for seasoning the cast iron grills i have used it a half dozen times now including adding an after market rotisserie fantastic temperature control by raising or lowering the coals or banking the coals away from the food in the multiple compartments more surface area than i ve ever had before very easy ash removal i recommend getting a vegetable oil spray and coating the cooking surface after each use easy to keep seasoned 
i always come back to farberware for a stockpot there s no brand like farberware it s the workhorse of the industry i love the covers as the edges drop into the pot so water or soup or anything in it ever seeps over the top the cover keeps everything locked in you can scrub and use the most abrasive pads to clean the pot and never worry they don t even scratch from use not that anything sticks that much you just don t have to worry i loved farberware stockpots years ago and i m still faithful i have one quart for over years and there is nothing wrong with it today they seem to last forever don t judge a stockpot by it s price still can t get better than farberware 
super easy to install gets all the magazine off the back of the toilet and looks grea 
i use it daily to make bacon i like this bacon plate because of it s circular size which is great for my microwave i use it daily to make one to three slices of bacon for family breakfast i ve had it for over six years and was looking for another one via the internet because it s starting to look tired and browning i thought it was perfect until i read the negative reviews but then again i never tried to grill a burger in the microwave one side is smooth i assume for defrosting and the other has elevated grill lines the fat drains off nicely which i store in a baby food jar in the fridge to flavor veggies etc when i bought this product it did not come with a grill cover anytime you use a plastic cover in a microwave the end product will be a steamed result great for veggies 
fine for inexpensive can opener i like the color it s a little bigger than i thought and the arm pops off alot but as far as opening a can it does great the magnet holds the lid after opened great for an inexpensive can opener 
fantastic tamper this is the best tamper i had in a long time how did i ever manage without it it works perfectly and i do not have to use much pressure i put it in the dishwasher and i am done get it because you will be satisfied as well 
great tool this product works great it allows me to froth milk and use coffee made in a regular coffee pot basically i can make lattes without having to have an espresso maker 
great pie dish this is a large deep pie dish the shape of the dish yields a beautiful pie especially apple 
best trash can ive ever had i love this trash can it works perfectly all you have to do when it arrives is pull it out of the box put the batteries in put a trash bag in and yoy are ready to go there is a ring inside the trash can that holds your liner in place just simply wave your hand over the front and the lid comes open and closes by itself it is a little noisy but i have teenagers so if the lid is opening then i know they have eaten something lol anyway enjoy the trashcan well worth the money ! 
i love this great gift idea this makes the best americano s i have ever had better than starbucks it takes a few uses to get the pot primed and then you are in business the cost of the pot has off set the cost i would have spent at the local coffee shop the only complaint i have if you do not get a good seal when you put the pot together the gasket sometimes leaks and you have coffee splatering 
ridiculously sharp ! great value this knife is ridiculously sharp and an amazing value for the price the fibrox handle feels great and the knife is nsf certified and dishwasher safe it also comes with a great knife protector caddy this thing is almost too sharp to leave out and so i leave it in a drawer in the protector when not in use i have some other nice knives including some henckels and a high qaulity japanese chef knife the only reason i didn t give the knife five stars is that it lacks the heft and is not as elegant looking as my other knives however it is just as sharp if not sharper ! i must admit that i haven t compared it to other boning knives as this is my first boning knife well have to see how it holds up over time but victorinox provides a lifetime warranty so i m not worried i can t believe how nice this knife is for the price 
outstanding product my fiance can t sleep without noise so he s always used a desk fan to help him sleep i m not overly fond of a fan blowing on us all winter long so i looked into white noise machines etc this already had the best review on amazon and having had it since christmas it s worth every penny i love the different sounds and truly sleep the night through using the celestial setting once i adjusted to it about one night the white noise is great as are many of the other sounds i turn it on any time i m in the bedroom now since it has settings for relaxation and focus sounds besides sleep it s also very lightweight and easily portable so we can take it with us when we travel making for much better sleep on the road we love it and i would definitely give it as a gift 
eliminate mess and odor wow i am very impressed with this product ! i have indoor only cats when i first saw this product in the pet store i thought this thing would fill up too quickly but i have owned it for a month now and only needed to empty it once i also assumed i d have to replace the bag roll each time it was emptied but that was not the case the original bag roll still has plenty left i used to flush the litter waste but there were always kitty litter grits sticking to the toilet bowl or seat and falling on the floor also our toilet backed up once when i tried to put too many litter clumps in it eww ! but the alternative smelly trash was just not an attractive option so i decided to give the litter locker plus a try and very glad i did i wonder if the previous reviewer who complained about it filling up fast had an earrlier smaller version because my cats produce a normal amount of waste which i scoop times a day and it didn t fill up until weeks passed 
perfect perfect size for rich desserts like creme caramel or creme brulee or mousse i also like the heavy feel 
my first real dishes for my nd apartment i decided to get real dishes instead of the hodge podge i had from dorms and thrift stores i could not be happier w these dishes the price was reasonable and they are incredibly durable i really like the plum its a rich purple and it was easy to match it to other fiestaware i liked the color so much i got the mugs and other kinds of bowls to match the dishes it was a great deal and it will be easy to add to my kitchen set 
so far so great after doing some comparison shopping for rice cookers and finding this model at a local houseware store i purchased this cooker today i used it this evening to prepare brown rice for dinner a bit of an acid test in my mind for any rice cooker the rice turned out flawless luscious plump flavorful soft and not chewy and not burnt at all clean up was simple and easy the instructions were easy to follow the power cord is retractable which is a plus for keeping one s countertops clear of too many cords i look forward to trying the other features of this cooker perhaps even making a simple cake with it the instruction manual includes sample recipes as well all in all highly recommended and very competitive with the zojirushi models i considered but which are more expensive you just can t go wrong with panasonic 
external hard drive case excellent product for protecting storing external hd amazaon had best price for this product 
hey they work i was alittle skeptical buying these but they seem to be working great 
held up to some serious hi test urine thanks to an obscure medical condition our son s urine is highly acidic remember alien remember the alien s acid blood that dissolved steel floors that s what we re talking about our last waterproof pad and who are they kidding when they say waterproof as if you re worried about water lasted one night after which our son s pee sizzled right through ruining another mattress thanks to it s kevlar romex weave and carbon nanotube construction the simmons pad was able to stop the urine better than any ordinary waterproof pad highly recommended seriously it s a mattress pad with a plastic lining it works it stops the pee from soaking through what more do you really want 
peace at last i had so many barking dogs that i was feeling like shooting them my rental business was suffering and the neighbors were enjoying their dog s disruption of the neighborhood some kind of power thing i guess when ever anyone went out in their yards these dog would charge and bark as though they meant to kill when my last short term renter a pastor yelled no ! at them i became desperate i had been told about barking collars and had them for my own dogs i was looking for a new collar cironella i plugged in anti bark and then up popped this super bark product i bought and put it on a poll in the garden behind a tree the dogs barked the entire time right at the fence until my daughter turned it on they ran like bats out of hell back to their house and haven t been heard since ! now i was a little sceptical at first but i can t praise this product enough you can not get anything else that will do this for you you can complain to the county till your blue in the face or spend thousands on an attorney and not win if you move you might end up with more barking look it s worth the money believe me 
wmf nortica hostess set we chose the wmf nortica design because of the quality of the heavy steel and the timeless classic look of the brushed metal finish and simple elegant lines this piece hostess set is all of that the design of the salad fork is kind of funky but all the pieces are usable well designed and look fantastic 
great pillows for kids loved this pillow it is a lot of fun 
a great starter piece or addition to your le creuset collection le creuset manufactures porcelain enameled cast iron cooking vessels as well as other products these cooking vessels are cast from molten iron poured in sand moulds that are used only once for this reason one pot may look like another but each is unique in its own way cast iron is a highly efficient material which absorbs and distributes heat efficiently it is recommended to use low to medium heat when cooking with cast there are a few exceptions like boiling water where cooking on high heat is appropriate and okay otherwise cooking with high heat may cause food to stick discolor the enamel coating or cook the food unevenly remove cast iron from the heat and it does not cool off quickly this helps your food stay warm while serving beware iron tends to be heavy so these cooking vessels tend to be heavy as well cast iron is an effective material for cooking so why cover it with enamel iron tends to rust iron oxide rust doesn t add any complimentary flavors to your food if your cast iron cooking vessel was not enameled you would have to season and maintain it adding the porcelain enamel not only looks good but has multiple benefits the enamel being a solid coating is one of the most hygienic surfaces to cook on does not stain absorb odors retain flavors and is easy to clean the enamel can be damaged so limit cooking tools to plastic or wood the benefits of cooking with le creuset cast iron are many but lets get down to the soup pot specifically quarts is not a whole lot of space when it comes to making soups consider your recipes when determining the size you need the soup pot tends to do best if at least full any less and you may overwhelm your food with the pot s evenly dispersed heat the pot has flat bottom that broadly curves up the sides to inches high making stirring your soup simple atop internal diameter of about inches makes for a wide top allowing room for a whole chicken the tight fitting lid is slightly angled sealing in heat moisture and flavors use the lid to hold your meat while you are making a sauce from the drippings or holding your prepared vegetables while creating your culinary feast its shape and design makes this an extremely versatile pan i tend to cook large amounts so this pan is usually used for mole de pollo chili con carne chicken and dumplings tomato sauce and soups once you get beyond the basic functionality the soup pot can really open up the possibilities keep in mind this is a quart pan with about a inch diameter perhaps the optimal pan for families from some possibilities for this pan besides soups include rice pilaf roasted chicken braising steamed artichokes jell o molds and assembling a baked alaska one feature that people tend to complain about is the cost the cost does seem steep compared to other pans made from other materials cast iron doesn t seem like it should be expensive compared to the old cast iron pans past generations have used for cornbread and camping however the manufacturing process requires making a mould for each and every pan produced these heavy pans then go through an enameling process before being shipped if you take what goes into making and distributing these high quality cast iron products the cost tends to make sense then consider that this pan will easily last a lifetime when taken care of prosefficient absorption and distribution of heathygienic enamel cooking surfacedoes not stain absorb odors or retain flavorseasy to clean when not abused or misusedcan be transferred from stove top to the oven to the tablecan easily last a lifetimecons its heavy as cast iron tends to be weighing in at about pounds 
good for hard cheeses not so great for soft ones asiago cheese works well in this grater but softer cheeses like cheddar and especially mozzarella tend to get smooshed through instead of being grated 
totally silent i love this filter ! it keeps the water pristine and more importantly it is easy to assemble and clean thanks to the included double tap valves and media basket silence was a key buying point for me as it was purchased for an aquarium in my bedroom this filter is absolutely silent so silent that i can now hear the hum of my fluorescent aquarium lights 
fabulous this is one of the little items that makes a big difference i am not a gadget person i like a lean clean kitchen this splatter screen helps with the clean ! i can t believe how well it works and how well it fits on any size pan get one youll love it 
my favorite vacuum container we have this container in constant use in the refrigerator holding prewashed precut veggies for snacking i find it easier to pack food into than our assorted tall round canisters it has actually improved our nutrition because the clear container with colorful veggies all ready to eat is the most beautiful thing in the refrigerator and the veggies stay all nice and fresh and crunchy no more slimy pepper strips the only downside is that you can t stack anything on top of the domed lid i don t use the cheese grater 
even easier and better than i thought i wanted a dual coffee espresso maker thinking i would mostly drink regular coffee with the occasional latte indulgence but i was totally surprised how easy it is to use and now it s lattes every day also there was almost no learning curve my first cup surprisingly from what i ve read elsewhere was near perfect and apparently it wasn t a fluke if there is any drawback it s only that there is no warming plate under the espresso carafe but i m sure a purist would scoff at such a notion if i have one recommendation it is to spring for a stainless steel carafe or whatever it s called to steam your milk i m not a physicist so i m not sure why but it does make a difference in summation this is a great deal on an excellent delivery system for my drug of choice i give it stars instead of because i have to grind the beans and it didn t include an intravenous unit 
banana tree and fruit bowl silver i bought this for my boyfriend s sister as i d broken her old banana tree i holds bunches of bananas easily and a whole box of clementines i think it s a or pound box in the bowl it fits between the cabinetcabinets on the counter of her kitchen and looks great ! everyone her her kids her husband my boyfriend and i loves it 
amazing cookware i received a few all clad products the paella pan sauce pan and a fry pan for graduation and they are excellent despite not being teflon food doesn t seem to stick and clean up is easy the handles don t get hot even though they re metal too they do get a little warmish so be careful just in case i m not sure if i m supposed to or not but i put them in the dishwasher and haven t had any problems this specific pan is great for items like pasta w cheese and veggies i love that it has a cover the only drawback is the price 
it travels too we took the fondue set and pre made cheese mixes for a weekend with friends it the easiest fastest meal to assemble and be ready ! great for after skating and skiing 
pretty good they re pillowcases they hold my pillows well good fabric and stitching comfortable 
my dog can play outside we do not have a fence so the petsafe wireless fence unit has significantly improved the quality of life for the dog and us we adjusted the base unit to allow the forest creatures to escape we weren t able to put the invisible fence where we had planned because the chain link enclosure the dog s sand box beside our driveway interfered with the signal the collar uses up the specialized batteries quickly so keep a supply on hand check the collar daily before using when the battery is replaced the collar must be reset to the appropriate shock level we left the boundary flags up for days although the dog figured it out the first day my dog has only experienced one shock at a setting of four on the first day since then the beep is enough to keep him within the boundaries petsafe retains control over the selling price of its products so there are no bargain basement prices by any vendor 
furniture saver it s hard to find these refills and if you can find them in a store you will save a few bucks but worth the extra money for shipping this toy is the only thing that saves my furniture from my two cats highly recommended 
love this litterbox i have used many automatic litter boxes but this is the best one the cartridges are easy to change i just have to order online to get the cartridges since they are usually out of them at the stores thank 
oscar rocks i love my duvet cover the fabric is of a very high quality and the print is attractive it is also washable which is a bonus 
great collar this collar doesn t feel as rough as most its soft and looks comfy but it is totally durable i have a jack russell my little guy pulls tugs and is pretty harsh on everything i would buy this again plus it s super cute ! 
welllll not to bad i purchased this sprayer to us with spray butter well it does work but a full pump only get a small amount of spray probably because it is so thick but it still sprays better than the plastic bottle the butter comes with it is easy to pump the bottle so i think it is worth the trouble to me hope this help 
great gift for everyone i bought this exact same slicer years ago for my mom and it has lasted it s a unique item that guests love and it s easy to clean up as well 
the best these are my favorite cookers so much so i bought this one for my friend 
wonderful spot remover i had no idea how good this product is it came with the vacuum cleaner so i figured i would use it on a mess my cat left after coughing up a hairball the dyzolv completely removed the stain this was not the first haiball the cat had coughed up previously i used some other spot remover i had it didn t do as good a job as the dyzolv since then the cat has coughed up more hairballs and everytime the dyson dyzolv removes the stain that is why i purchased two more bottles 
good size i have of these mugs in plum they are the perfect size for cereal soup and hot chocolat 
the best roti tortilla maker you will ever find ! seriously i have tried sooo many different roti tortilla makers and this saachi is seriously the best out there ! bargainoffers com company is the best ! they have great customer service and are such nice people i have tried the crappy villaware inch model as well as the horrible inch revel brand and i had nothing but problems they stick and dont heat up well enough the saachi is great never had a problem ever ! 
the perfect madeleines this pan provided a wonderful light golden color to the madeleines i recommended using a spread of tablespoon of melted butter and tablespoon of flour mixed and brushed on to the molds this made them virtually nonstick and added wonderfully to the color and taste this product is wonderful i might have to order a second one since my recipe always yields batches ! 
melitta one mango a very interesting coffeemaker indeed funky but conservative colors and a rocket shaped design lets you know this product is unique it is not small however just because it s a single serve maker does not make it small it serves about cups with one coffeepod and is instantly warmed up and ready to go the only drawback is buying the pods specifically made for coffeemakers such as these and they can t be used for any other coffee maker 
very good i was looking for a air pot that would keep coffe hot in our office for to hours and and not have a glass liner this has surpassed my expectations i would recomend this air pot to anyone looking to have a hot cup of coffee 
danby countertop dishwasher we use the dishwasher in the office workroom of our church it is the perfect size for a small staff of to people does a great job and is rather quiet and was easy to connect 
great universal knife i really have enjoyed using this knife it is a great universal knife it is nice to have when one needs to cut through chicken skin for deboning i also like the design of the handel 
supercute cooks a mean pot roast love it nice design keeps the meat tender juicy comes with a tupperware like lid that seals up your left overs for easy storage in the frig very happy with the purchase 
great protection this product is more substantial than the one we previously got from cost plus works better and has a small hole in the top for steam useful keeps the mess on the plate 
awesome dehumidifier i bought the unit to control the humidity problems we were having in our home the musty smell in the room is gone now all we need to do is empty the water that collects every once in while 
great filters the filter for my hoover floormate was getting dirtier and dirtier i had washed them many times but it was time to get a new one imagine my surprise that the stores did not carry that particular filter after numerous phone calls i decided to check the net i found them here at amazon great price fast service thanks so much ! 
an excellent knife for everyday use i received this henckels santoku knife as a graduation present along with a full set of pro s knives when i graduated from culinary school i had done a lot of research about different brands of knives and felt that the henckels pro s series was the best for me the grip is not cheap and i love the weight of the knife in my hand and the santoku knife is excellent i have been using it almost everyday for years it has replaced my chef s knife as my primary knife and i now use it for simple tasks like cutting up vegetables such as onions and potatoes and i also use it for more difficult tasks such as cutting up a chicken this is a great knife that with proper care and sharpening will last for many years 
awesome opener you will not be disappointed with this purchase it s so easy to use set it in place on top of the can and hold it comfortably with one hand while effortlessly turning the handle with the other you won t have any liquids seeping out and making a mess so the opener stays clean ! both the can and lid have smooth edges the lid will also fit snugly back on the can it s wonderfully compact which makes storing easy i just can t say enough good things about it i absolutely love this can opener ! 
two polyactyl thumbs up for cosequin my cat mira a year old polydactyl tabby was diagnosed with hip dysplasia several months ago she d never been a big leaper never leapt onto my kitchen counters ! but when she wouldn t jump onto my bed or even sit up for a little bite of tuna i knew she was in trouble x rays showed hip dysplasia her vet put her on a short regimen of prednisone plus daily supplements of cosequin pill per day after two weeks i was able to discontinue the prednisone that left her with just the cosequin which her vet recommended should remain a permanent supplement to her diet im happy to report that since she s been off the prednisone eating food supplemented once daily with the cosequin she s been her old self again ! she leaps easily onto my bed and sits up for treats i m very happy with the results of this supplement and so s she two polyactyl thumbs up for cosequin 
love these bowls these are called fruit bowl but they are the perfect size for a couple of scoops of ice cream 
nice but a bit overpriced i love the yarn but after i bought it from amazon i found the same yarn for less at a craft store chain 
exactly what we expected this is a great handy organizer for three different sized containers plus the containers and covers the containers are in even metrics sizes and ml it works out to and cups the two larger sizes take the same cover so there are only two different size covers the organizer takes up a tad more real estate than it needs to but we ll live with it our current collection of plastic containers is just a jumble so this is soooo much better we re not complaining the dimensions of the organizer are inches wide by inches deep by inches high it fits ok in our upper shelf in the kitchen there is enough room in the cover storage bins to add about more large covers and more small covers if you want to add a couple more containers to the organizer the height of your cabinet is the only limit on the number of containers it will hold the containers microwave nicely i had some spaghetti microwaved in one container for breakfast the containers are on the clear side of translucent so it is relatively easy to see what is inside clearer than most other containers of that kind though we ll see if they stay clear after a few weeks of microwaving spaghetti sauce ! 
kitchen helper i really like this tool rack it s sturdy and simple to attach to the wall the metal hooks slide so you can adjust them to fit the width of your hangable cooking tools it comes with hooks i have a set of measuring cups hanging two sets of measuring spoons on one hook and my can opener and oxo y peeler on the other i like being able to get to my measuring cups and other frequently used items without having to rummage around in the drawer looking for them 
my kitchen workhorse expensive but so worth it this is by far the most used item in my kitchen think about it if you could increase your cooking surface area when browning meat or vegetables or cooking soup chili or spaghetti sauce wouldn t you do so this dutch oven does exactly that i use it to brown everything i rarely use my very fine all clad chef s skillet any more and i actually love the high sides they reduce spatters without reducing browning since the cast iron almost guarantees perfect browning this is a great pan if you need to develop fond nothing burns in this pan once you get it up to temperature i actually have le creuset dutch ovens in varying sizes but i end up using this big one most of the time come on you know you want it buy it 
try these started using these for a puppy since i work irregular shifts purchased a pad holder to stop her from shredding it works great no leaky messes and very little smell 
krups fbc in white this toaster oven works well it has various presets for pizza and bagelsthat makes it very easy to use for bagels it toasts the top and warmsthe bottom so they really come out nice it cooks pizza a lot faster than the oven with no preheat time toast always seems to come out just right the toast setting defaultsto level but needs a setting of which is easy to change when the time is up a fairly loud beeper sounds and the oven shuts off this is really great esp for kids since they tend to getdistracted and leave stuff in the oven for too long i think the white color is much more attractive than the black and it alsomatches all the appliances in our kitchen 
so versatile what a wonderful portable appliance use it for a stockpot pasta cooker deepfrier or whatever quick and easy to use and a snap to clean up i use it all the time have two of them now you can plug it in and use it anywhere 
simply the best this mission folding bookcase is simply the best although i wanted a black bookcase but the natural is also great and it took me about minutes to put it up since no assembly was needed 
great value these towels are generously sized thick and luxurious probably worth much more than the cost here on amazon 
i want to buy this item but i haven t noticed any complaints about the way the carafe on the coffee pot pours i have the xp and you have to pour it sooooooooo slow or else you ll have a huge mess i ve contacted the company and they say that they cannot help me with this prob and my only solution is to return the machine since it s within days of my purchase help i can use some feedback on this subject 
good idea we have used this crockpot bbq pit a couple of times since buying it the first time we made the pork ribs very delicious tender and tasty but cleaning up the crockery insert was very difficult required lots of scrubbing the second time i sprayed it with pam cooking spray which made cleaning up easier but still required some scrubbing even after soaking it the third time i used a disposable aluminum pan put the chicken and other ingredients into it put it into the crockpot and cooked away perfect ! no clean up just toss the disposable pan and we had a delicious meal i would recommend this crockpot if you want a larger crockpot than the typical one the ribs were really good fell off the bone tender ! i cooked two whole chickens at once in it and they were good all in all though a pretty good product but use the disposable aluminum tray makes life much easier 
dogs love the sound and get so excited could be more durable though my dogs just go crazy over the sound this toy makes ! excellent exercise for them i really really wish it were a bit more durable as my dogs are able to destroy chew them i have to take them away long before the sound mechanism gives out due to them makes holes in the skin please wiggly giggly can you make them stronger somehow then they would be perfect ! 
the largest version of presto s gold standard in basic deepfry this is the family size edition of presto s popular fry daddy line of fryers i have had my own fry daddy for years now and my grandmother has had hers for over still the same basic quality fryer simple heat and fry it has no lid or filter to filter the smell and prevent splatterlike some of the fancy models this is just plain frying best rules if frozen don t just drop the item in fast and i tend to use this more in the warmer weather when i can have my windows open if you have a good hood above your stove that can be helpful as well otherwise tasty food quickly i still love my fry daddy its affordable and reliable 
absolutely cutting edge henckels is definetelyone of the finest knives made in the world today it s name stands for durability and quality i use their knives in my kitchen daily and they never fail to come thru any situation i put in front of them i highly recommend these knives for the pro or the home kitchen 
serta pound micro memory foam pillow i bought two sets of these take the center firm fill out if you want them soft or leave it in for a firm pillow 
nice pan but lid is thin i like the pans shape and size it is really large but not too heavy the only thing is the beautiful shiny lid is too thin it is almost sharp it s so thin but i do like the pan and it cooks lots of potatoes with easy non stick cleaning 
sunflower minidisk pitcher it is adorable we had a large picture just like this when i was a child so this is a special reminder of it the minidisk pitcher is just the right size for an individual syrup pitcher for pancakes i would love to have one in every color 
beautiful we purchased the stainless steel version of this flatware when we got married years ago it has held up so well that i just purchased ten more place settings the friday only sale to use for entertaining our older set still looks new even though we have used it every day this flatware is heavy and really nice to hold the handles are not so heavy or thick that they are hard to hold or to eat from the super simple design works and looks beautiful with any table setting design from casual and contemporary to completely elegant for special occasions 
it does what it s supposed to does it look and feel cheap yes ! does it do exactly what i expect it to make coffee automatically at a pre programmed time in the morning yes ! i ve used it to make coffee before i wake up every morning for almost a month though the design of the pot itself is pretty bad i kinda expect it to break or otherwise fail sooner or later it s done the job so far and i can t complain 
commercial hard anodized quart shallow saucepan with lid very pleased with the quality of this pan good weight and cooks food evenly clean up is easy too good product 
love the sheets the sheets are just what i was looking for the delivery time was good am very happy with my purchase 
easy to use amp festive too i was given this dish by request for my birthday and it has barely gotten a rest since ! it works wonderfully for pies and tarts but even better for baked appetizer dishes or nachos the dish washes well in the dishwasher and stacks nicely in the cabinets i wish it had little handles on the edges for better gripping when it comes out of the oven it has a rim that is good to hold onto but for clumsy chefs something more might be better other than that i love this dish and keep finding more and more uses for it 
great price nice to be able to buy single bowl i cook and freeze a lot of meals for my husband who often works late i won t use tupperware or other plastic because i believe plastic can leach into food while microwaving but pyrex bowls of this size are hard to find in stores most stores have pyrex baking sets with several containers that are too large or too small finally i can buy just these bowls as many as i want without getting stuck with other sizes i don t need this is a great price for them too on ebay people want more plus shipping 
quite operation but what ever you do don t loose the instructions ok this is a nice feeder i like it better then our last that sounded like it was grinding gravel however holy cow what ever you do don t loose the instructions programming the thing requires the most counter intuitive convoluted set of steps that make no sense at all and are completely illogical you will never figure it out for yourself it is so retarded even if you figure it out one time forget it you will never remember and be able to do it again who programs this stuff 
what a great knife a friend of my girlfriend came over to cook dinner with us one night and brought her global knife after using it to cut vegetables and meat we were very impressed it is perfectly balanced and very lightweight the blade is super sharp so the carrots don t go flying off the cutting board while you re chopping them my girlfriend especially liked the knife so i went on the amazon and bought her one although i have never owned a quality knife before so i cannot compare i am very happy with this knife and would like to collect the entire set 
i want to buy more of this item in varying sizes recently purchased this in mid and it is the best cookware item i have ever owned and used as one of those millions who rely on mid line priced discount department store brands i can state with certainty i was amazed and still am with the high performance this item offers ! the clean up is still a dream cometrue all i have to do is get it in the sink and with a very very small amount of liquid dish detergent clean and rinse it practically cleans itself my burners are all equal size gas stove and highest setting is i have learned all i have to do for pancakes is level cooking bacon an entire pound is no problem for this cookware i do want to purchase more of this item there is a smaller griddle version of this item also available i m even thinking of slowly switching to this brand allclad nonstick 
great iced tea pitcher but the quotbutquot stands for my sincere wish that the pitcher was about larger and that the plastic of which it is made was just a little heavier otherwise love it going to drink a lot of great iced tea this summer 
diane wonderful actually as good as i had hoped it would be only wish it had an on off switch plugging in is the on switch 
more shoes please i got tired of having shoes all over my room so i ordered this shoe rack i m happy happy happy with it it takes up very little floor space since it uses vertical space to store shoes shoes also have a chance to air out between wearings i think i actually wear more of my shoes since i can see them and get to them in a second i highly recommmend this shoe rack for anyone who loves shoes and has limited storage space 
patio decor enhancer the assembly was a bit tedious forty bolts to be tightened with a hex tool even for a doityourselfer like myself but upon completion is was well worth it this set has definitely transformed my living space and is extremely comfortable solid construction no wobbling as we say in trinidad money well spent 
it works as a replacement i had to decide whether to get a whole new coffeemaker when the carafe broke and did the usual search for a replacement i bought this one and was able to keep my investment items like this are hard to find locally one hardware store was going to order it from a supplier and have it shipped to them and are often way overpriced in specialty shops being able to order online is a huge convenience and i probably will just do it next time instead of going through the brick and mortar search 
a nice version of a useful item the napkin holder is a great compliment to your kitchen especially if you have a wine theme going i bought it for my sister inlaw and it looks great on her countertop the only think that was a bit deceptive is that it looks like black wrought iron but it s really more a dark brown 
any bad reviewers are insane unless you received a defective unit there is no way anyone could give this any rating short of stars ive owned dozens of booklights by several manufacturers and nothing compares to this product ive had mine for over years and its still going perfectly its also sick that even though i read with it an average of an hour a night ive only had to replace the batteries times my spouse sleeps peacefully while i use this booklight was not the case with other booklights that shine on page dont be deterred by reviewers that say it isn t bright enough if this light isn t bright enough for your eyes then you have no business reading in the dark the only downside i can come up with is that the clear area is somewhat easy to scratch my unit has many hairline scratches that you can see during the day but are practically invisible when at use at night buy it you won t be dissappointed 
weird color cute casserole i ve got just about every le creuset color in existence so why not try out kiwi it s an oddball color i think but this little casserole is soooo cute i used my petite casseroles recently for serving french onion soup it s an excellent individual serving size for this keeps the soup warm and i was able to put them all in the oven to broil momentarily for the swiss cheese slice of french bread on top it s rather expensive for the size though so it gets knocked down one star for price 
perfect in every way if you re a coffee lover but the only one in your house this coffee maker is perfect for you i use mine every day it allows you to quickly brew one fresh cup of coffee at a time and the availability of coffee pods in varying strengths and flavors is only improving for the money this is a wise purchase and it will meet your needs as a single coffee drinker in your home 
breakfast of champions i like cooking breakfast my family likes eating breakfast this griddle is perfect for cooking up a bunch of eggs pancakes sausages croissants fried with butter yum for a large number of people breakfast made easy no more trying to weasel or pancakes into a frying pan this thing will handle pancakes at a time no worries and clean up is a breeze just don t scratch it 
great pet fountain filter it was a delight to order this item and it was handled very fast and efficentially thanks for the prompt attention to the order 
makes a huge difference some features confusingly lacking i got this to accompany my gaggia carezza because had been having inconsistent results with blade grinders and store bought pre ground wasn t doing it for me this thing makes a huge difference it s incredible for that particular espresso machine i found that a grind setting of works great the problems are the doser doesn t actually neatly dose anything sometimes i have to hit it times sometimes puzzling you can eye it but the thing only appears to work if you grind a bunch of beans and make more than one drink first drink it takes a few pulls to get the grounds to the front for the doser also there s no neat way to only grind what you need to use looks like some experimentation and another timer will be required another issue is it looks like you have to actually disassemble it which is not a simple task to clean it thoroughly or really even at all overall it s quiet creates perfect grounds has a ton of settings although i can only see myself using two one for coffee one for espresso but the doser is garbage i might have opted for a cheaper model knowing this but my lattes are perfect now 
dyson dc great product works very well only down side is that it is very loud much louder than any other vacuum that i have tried the unit is also heavy which my wife dislikes 
very good but not perfect it is very useful but it doesn t hold heat almost hours like some people discribed overall it is very good that we can carry hot coffee around the house instead of stationary coffee maker pot so we don t have to walk to kitchen to refill coffee i will recomend it to other people 
very satisfied this is a sturdy well made appliance a little soak soap wash gets any food that might be leftover in the textured surface i don t know that the textured surface serves a major purpose because it is so slight of a texture i am getting ready to buy this same appliance for my mother in law 
high quality on par with all clad and good for induction stove after much research and looking at different triply clad cookware from henckels kitchenaid calphalon and all clad i decided on gourmet standard i am very glad i did the cookware is beautiful and the stainless steel and aluminum is thicker than all the other name brands mentioned above except for all clad which i think is a bit thicker compared to all clad i feel it is a better value in terms of costs and the size of the pans you get cook s illustrated stated that this cooked just like all clad so save yourself some money and go with gourmet standard it s also good for induction stoves 
coffee pot review the machine works very well my complaints are minor but annoying namely the off and on switch is so small that during the day you can t really tell if it s on or off unless you stand right at thei machine and cup your hands over the area ulnfortunetelyl l many new applieances also have a minesciule light the other thing is the pour while brewing feature the pot is so samll for one why would you want it and two i use my own cup instead of the glass caraffe so that the coffee drips right into the cup and with the pour and brew feature nothing fits under it except the original caraffe so i took off the extra button made the drip hole smaller with a piece of aluminum foil and now i m set 
contour pillows an excellent value ! i have been looking out for this type of pillow and was so pleased to see the amazon ad quite comfortable i have neck problems with arthritis and pinched nerves and this pillow definitely provides relief 
i just love this i first got introduced to the flip n fold while visiting my son he tends to be a neat freak in a good way i noticed his shirts were folded so perfectly i know i didn t teach him that when i told him how nicely folded they were he told me about the flip n fold he got me one for christmas the next year i purchased this one for my dad he is my mom had passed away a couple of years ago and he is now doing his own laundry he stayed with me for awhile and mentioned to me how he liked the way i folded his shirts so i purchased this for him he really loves it and shows it to everyone who comes to see him 
they re filters i ordered these filters for my fish tank they were shipped quickly the quality is good and they keep my tank clean 
great shears i ve ever owned they are really very sharp compared to the last shears i ve owned the color matches my kitchen motif and i can take them apart and use one side to open a package 
awesome fun great value i bought this little thing about week ago and have been amazed it works great comes with spare props and is one of the slickest little toys i ve ever seen it lasts for about minutes on a charge and takes about minutes to charge the headlight flashes when the batteries are dying to warn you but as the sub floats automatically it s not really necessary its two motors make it very maneuverable although a little tricky as forward causes the sub to dive and reverse raises it the fish in my pond and aquarium are mildly curious and mildly annoyed by the sub so far it s been fairly rugged withstanding frequent use by me and my year old sub hard to beat at this price 
a glove that simply fits over the metal handle of your pan the essential requirement for those hot metal handles and so much more practical than a bulky oven glove another brilliant product from le creuset a progressive company that never seems to stop coming up with bright ideas for serious cooks and kitchenalia addicts sensibly priced and one of those items that once you have one you just cannot do without one look out for the cream red blue and black versions too as a footnote the handle glove is a really useful and inexpensive extra to give with a le creuset omelette pan as a home warming a shower engagement gift or a wedding present ! 
fiestaware pie baker i like it very much it works well easy to clean i would recommend this product to others 
birthday gift for daughter i had previously purchased the tribest for myself and had such a good experience with it that i decided my daughter would benefit from owning the personal blender she has two small children and the fruit smoothies are a big hit with them she also uses the blender for quick sauces cream soups and other purposes 
works well we ve had this for about a week it does a great job of keeping my daughter s x foot room warm all night when on low setting watts and about half on the thermostat setting we left it on full blast in the garage for three hours when we first got it and it definitely gave off an oil smell we moved it to the bedroom after that no smell at all it does get a little hot to touch so not for use around small kids nor can you put it against draperies or furniture 
great juicer the best juicer i ve ever used brings kitchenaid quality to a product that can be anything but with other brands easy to clean up and especially quiet 
buy from witbecks miele makes a great vacuum and this is one for sure but i want to recommend the seller witbecks wonderfully personalized and caring service from someone whose last name is actually witbecks when dhl screwed up their delivery an immensely crappy organization but that s another story he stepped in and sent another unit without delay terrific guy terrific price terrific service 
microwave steamer it s a standard pyrex microwave casserole dish with a plastic steamer basket as usual dollar for dollar you can t beat the quality of pyrek products for cooking this is a nice addition to any cook s supplies especially if you do frozen veggies in the microwave it s simple basic easy to clean no gadgetry love it 
good value and powerful i purchased this unit just over a month ago it arrived in less than a week i ve had no problems with it yet it is truly all metal except for the splash guard ingredient chute to address some other reviews that had me concerned the head doesn t slap around that is a warranty issue for her it does walk with big stiff dough recipes such as a two loaf all wheat simple physics considering size and weight tells you at medium to high speeds it will kinda lets you know it is a powerful electronic speed controlled mixer i can easily steady the base for the few seconds to finish mixing all other mixing jobs are done with ease i personally like the tilt head all stand mixers will require side scraping with some recipes even the expensive kitchenaids although i made a five bar cheesecake yesterday and as i was watching the eggs dropped in at the side one at a time they were all fully captured and mixed in i usually scrape once at the beginning and it spins into a dough ball at the end anyway there is a dimple at the bottom of the bowl to help pick up added flour during the mix speaking of kitchenaid have you read the reviews of those attachments besides being expensive they say all of them suck it seems you can buy better and cheaper items to do the same thing taking up the same amount of space so far i ve made loaves of baguettes loaves of wheat loaves of sourdough numerous cakes batches of cookies and of course a large cheesecake since i ve had it with no problems now you can see why i needed a strong stand mixer ! my church loves me now too the key is to read the instructions more than once to ensure you understand how to operate this model it has some cool recipes in there too ! and yes it is very easy to clean as well if you want a mixer to crank out mega loaves of all wheat bread daily commercial then this is not it if you want to make great bread dishes and pastries for your family then this can t be beat at this price range with this much power after all as one consumer already stated this is a consumer reports best buy i ve had a sunbeam heritage like the one shown on the cookin in brooklyn show and contrary to popular belief there is not a motor under the bottom pedestal it s great for everything else but gluttonous bread dough s a white loaf every once in a while maybe but i wanted to be more artisan and organic with my breads so i upgraded note the short time i ve had it is the only reason i ve given it stars for me longevity counts as one star hobby baker 
so useful for food and item storage i bought this pair initially for salad storage we make a week s worth at a time but i ve decided these are a perfect size for hobby storage etc so am going to buy two more 
durable easy to clean i ve had this a couple years and it shows no signs ofdecay or staining cleaned many times in an automaticdish washer 
satisfied customer i am very pleased with this product the atelier wash is soft absorbent and looks good after laundry i have always found the martex brand to be top quality 
great little fan i first i was surprises to see that the blades were made out of cloth but when i turned it on it worked great and it is absolutely quiet also the cloth blades make it less dangerous if you hit the fan with your hand the only small negative is that it could be a little stronger at peak power setting 
what a great bet sitting pillow i am often writing hours some days i learnt long ago that sitting at a pc was killing me legs often had swelling worse i suffered bad tendinitis in my neck elbow and wrist i mean painful to where i would have to stop using the pc then i switched to laptops and wow no more pain in my neck elbow or wrist but it s often a pain to keep the pillows pushed up in the proper comfort and and the one behind my neck is forever slipping here it the perfect solution i use a pillow under my knees and this wonderful creation it s not like the old fashioned bed sitting pillow that just propped your back his is so comfortable leaning against it is like learning on a cloud of feathers there is has strong arms that give you support but the best thing is the neck rest sort of like the whiplash cushion in a car it has a special pillow insert its removable that cradles your neck so if you watch telly in bed sitting up or read books or use a laptop this is worth every penny to have complete comfort ! it comes is several shades even denim to match your decor i highly recommend this for anyone who sits in bed 
great drip coffee average espresso the drip coffee is wonderful but the espresso is weak it seems like the pump does not generate enough pressure to make real full bodied espresso overall a satisfactory purchase 
there are better toys out there from sit stay dog loves the squirels to play with but has trouble with the game there is a additional squrel pack i would recomend that instead they honey bea and the hedge hog the extra eggs are good on their own to they squeek 
panasonic mc bagless straight suction canister vacuum i very much like this vacuum cleaner it is small enough to manuver around the areas that i need to clean in my home i really like how it is not so big heavy and cumbersome to move around just not having any bags to empty or try to find and stock up on is also a real plus for me i highly recommend this small easy to use not too noisey vacuum thankslgoodfront royal va 
this is a good buy i liked the comforter set it s a good buy although i would have liked to have more preferences in colo 
great piece i love it i wanted a small table to put in my guest room to put the tv on when i saw this piece on the website i thought that it would go good with the cherry bed that i had in there my son uses the guest room as his game room for his ps and gamecube etc we put all of the game stuff in the doors so that when guests are in there they cannot see all of his game stuff and it does not look cluttered br when my husband got the piece put together which he had no problems like some of the other reviewers stated i was so impressed by how great it looked in the room with the bed it matches perfect ! i am really pleased with it and would recommend it to anyone that does not have a lot of space for big pieces the only thing i did not like was that it had a couple of little tiny knicks in the wood but my husband touched that up with some stain that we had that was the same color overall very pleased and would buy night stands if they had them 
homemaker this is the best mixer i have ever owned and i have been a homemaker for years i love the many different speeds it has a build in timer so you know how long you have been using it at that speed it has a retractable cord so it doesn t get all twisted and tangled when stored it whips up great mashed potatoes you can tell i really love it 
mixed review i bought one of these wafflers after doing more research than the subject warrants i m sure my local mom pop carry this line so i purchased it from them the first waffler wouldn t heat up out of the box so i exchanged it so far so good with the replacement this would be a star review if the first unit had worked and if the belgian waffle recipe wasn t such a waste of supplies first trial using the recipe booklet s recipe for belgian waffles produced some rather inedible results even my son the hoover vacuum thought they weren t very nice the finished waffles were pale and spongy despite being baked at a thermostat setting of second trial run using my tried and true joy of cooking basic waffle produced well baked if heavy waffles crispy outsides tender insides the vacuum pronounced them fit to eat and proceeded to tuck away segments or total waffles this morning s recipe used a modified buttermilk waffle recipe from joc the results were light and crispy well browned crispy on the outside tender and airy on the inside my son got around two entire waffles modified recipe separate eggs melt a stick of butter whisk the yolks with c buttermilk toss together c flour c cornstarch t baking powder t baking soda pinch salt optional t sugar beat the eggwhites until stiff but not dry using a spatula quickly stir the flour mixture into the buttermilk mixture then quickly add the melted butter and stir until the batter is mostly smooth fold in eggwhites make waffles 
a honey of a kettle i think i read about all of the reviews before buying this dutch oven cherry red i put it in my shopping cart then procrastinated checked back and the price had increased by about one valuable tip in the reviews was about the non glazed inner rim of the lid it could become rusty so i try to clean the kettle as soon as possible and put the four little rubber tabs back on the outer rim to hold the lid up off of the kettle when not in use it was also a nice idea to keep it on the stove where it adds a cheerful color to the kitchen ive had the dutch oven for about months now and i simply love it it was a worthwhile investment so far i ve just been using it for making soups soup stock roasts and one dish meals but i ll be launching out with more experiments thanks to a lot of the reviewers for their excellent tips and also warnings about what not to do here s to good health 
mold what mold i m puzzled by the several reviews that say the filter gets moldy too fast i am replacing my first filter after about a year because it has built up deposits of lime i never noticed any mold 
goose down love this comforter it is just the right weight for what we needed and fits the duvet cover perfectly came faster than i expected which of course thrilled me 
great little opener bought this for my mom and had a chance to check it out and use it during a thanksgiving visit pros very sturdy and feels well made has great hand feel and i think it will last a good long time ill post an edit to this review if it doesn t opens a wide variety of containers and should serve my mom well with of her opening needs the portion of this tool that grips the lid to be opened has a semi tacky feel and provides a good hold on the interior of the tool con the exterior handle where your hand contacts the tool could be prone to slipping it s hard textured plastic with no rubber gripping surfaces and that concerns me again this is based on a good amount of thanksgiving usage but no long term tests so far i ll re post if this review changes based on my mom s experience we 
really surprised how strong this vacuum is in picking up hair and animal hair crevice quick flip makes it easy to use for hard to reach places picking up the dirt ! downside is the small dirt container but that is minor vs the power this small machine has 
the best dog bed my dogs love this bed and so do i i have two chihuahuas although this bed would fit a dog up to at least pounds my dogs always go straight into this bed and love to cuddle underneath the covers one even prefers it to sleeping in our big human bed ! every time my dogs are tired they retire straight to this bed the bed is machine washable which is really nice because the dogs stay smelling good after you bathe them in fact when the bed is in the wash they miss it i do not think the person who gave the bed one star gave it a chance she said it tipped too much the bed is very fluffy when it first arrives and after it is washed but it flattens out very quickly and you can speed that up in under five second by hand 
wonderful and waterproof this is a wonderful mitt ! by being waterproof it maintains insulation even when i accidentally stick my thumb into some of my hot cooking i purchased mitts for others in my family 
wilton cupcakes n more display great product perfect for my daughter s birthday party and a big hit at the school parties as well a really neat idea 
great expresso granos performs like machines four times as expensive superior product great tasting expresso rivals starbucks and very reliable i have owned the granos for about months and have found it to be a pleasure it is easy to use and makes a top quality cup of expresso the style of the unit is also unique and has generated much conversation with house guests if you want a reliable expresso machine that makes a great straight shot or latte i can t recommend the granos more highly i plan to buy another for my office 
top rate multi purpose sheet as a serious cook i look for tough uncoated surfaces that won t rust or require such ginger care the pan is sturdy priced right fits perfectly in the oven without a rack and cleans up like a dream nordicware is great whether roasting vegetables roasting a turkey or baking sheets of brownies or cookies it distributes heat evenly without burning and does a consistent job every time no need for wooden or teflon utensils you can use whatever you want whenever you want if you re looking for a non stick surface add parchment or a silpat that browns cookies evenly and lets you slide them right off i like this pan so much i own so i can rotate them and do a great amount of baking without waiting for the sheets to cool it also ensures they stack nicely in the cabinet the lid is a nice addition making it convenient and secure to store cookies and brownies right on the sheet without removing them or worrying if the saran wrap or foil will slip off bravo 
decent grinder this grinder has worked well enough for me the biggest problem i have with it is that the plastic lid rattles loose while grinding so you need to hold it in place to keep it running this is a minor deficit since most grinders need their tops held on while grinding 
wonderful product i purchased this for my little yorkshire terrier to stay in when we all leave the house to go to work its wonderful it is the perfect size and doesnt take up alot of room my little dog likes to jump up and stand against the walls of this product and they dont fall or shake so it is very sturdy yet very light it took me a minute to assemble the product and the little door makes it so great we leave it open and my little dog goes in and comes out when he wants this is a great buy and cheap too 
not for smaller dogs i bought this but found the swivel clips to be too heavy for my shih tzu and yorkie so i gave it to my friend who has bigger dogs it s pretty good quality and heavy duty 
cat loves them i m getting more my cat is obsessed with these mice and i find them in piles under the couch and tv stand i m actually buying more today b c he gets so sad when he can t find them 
great product this was a gift for my mother and she loved it she especially liked the stand the mixer sits in and boy does it have power great ! 
happy customer i am pleased with the product i purchased it was purchased as a gift for my mother inlaw she seems to be very pleased with it the transaction was easy and i received the merchandise in a timely manner the product came new in excellent condition 
works like a charm and never needs oiling this is a great waffle iron i like the fact that you never have to oil it though that also may depend on your batter recipe i just know that the old iron i had prior to this did need oiling every other waffle what a pain and not as healthy some have mentioned the alarm is annoying personally i prefer it whatever the sound i have been known to always forget the last one and burn it to a crisp now that s hard to do with this handy little alarm 
heaven sent i bought my thermometer about a year ago and have used it to cook beef and chicken to perfection no more dry meat whether it is in the oven or in a smoker or grill then i tried it to make fudge best fudge i ve ever made and the temperatures were very accurate plan on buying one for each of my children for christmas 
good to have one at home nice little toaster with good price just be careful it can get really hot when toasting 
solid very rich color very solid and deep great for cereal may be too heavy for young kids 
awesome spoons these are a great addition to your kitchen for those of you who love red as i do and are looking for an alternative to wood they don t scratch your non stick surfaces and are great sizes the small one is a perfect size for me and the larger one my husband loves because it was made for larger hands with larger diameter and scooping anyhow for their price i feel they are worth it they have held up great in the top rack of the dishwasher and with their darker color don t hold stains they are super heat resisitant as my son left one in the saucepan while he was helping me cook unknown to me and it never melted at all a must have they have it in blue too 
agree that smaller would be better i have cats and find that if i fill this more than halfway the water gets discolored before it s time to refill my cats like to play in it getting scum and food in the water so it needs to be cleaned at least once a week it s a great product and i don t mind filling it halfway however it would have probably made more sense to get the smaller one i would also suggest that the food and water are kept a good distance from each other to help keep the water clean it is not fun to clean it while it s still full as for the gurgleing it is not a major problem with cat s since they don t drink as much as dogs it rarely happens while they are standing there when it does they either run off and come back later or they try to play with it 
great glasses we live in mexico and therefore drink tequila quite often most mexicans will tell you that the only way to drink tequila is in a caballito or shot glass but these glasses make a big difference especially when drinking aejos or reposados they are tall enough that you can get a good whiff without too much interference from the alcohol fumes the sweet vanilla oak notes of the aejos are especially enhanced by these glasses but even the grassy vegetal blancos are more lively than when tasted in a standard shot glass my wife whose hands are much smaller than mine agreed that the glasses are very well balanced and comfortable to hold a great way to degustar a very noble spirit 
quality construction good performance looks nice great price i purchase this unit refurbished for about days ago i held off writing a review until i used it for a bit so far my overall impression is very good i feel i received a good value buying the refurbished product to be completely honest i m not sure my unit was even used once the exterior of the box had a lot of wear but inside the box everything seemed brand new i smelled the burrs and there was no coffee smell at all was it even used it works very well i have noted the same minor complaints as others mostly that the bottom glass jar feels like i could break it simply by holding it in my hand and there is always a pinch of mess after grinding no matter what you do i have one other minor issue to add to this list when grinding there is a small row of beans that do not drop down into the grinder they get stuck along the ridge of the glass at the top i have to leave it running and try knocking them all down this isn t really all that bad of a thing to deal with but i d prefer to walk away and come back to all beans completely ground i have found a way to minimize the mess when you pull out the bottom container with fresh ground coffee in it leave the unit running even though all beans have been ground then rock slide the bottom jar back and fourth to jiggle the plastic plate where the grounds fall out through when i do this i get a lot of extra grounds that fall through into the jar a lot more than i d expect then i shut off the unit and pull out the jar the mess is significantly reduced just a few crumbs instead of a small pile i can t speak for life span of the unit as others have noted it feels very solid and of a high quality construction if someone were to break into the house you better believe i d be reaching for this grinder heck i might use it as an anvil when i need to do metal work i gave this a star rating i reserve stars for a product that is perfect if kitchenaid beefed up the glass thickness in the lower jar to match the upper bean hopper did something about the slight mess and removed the ridge in the upper hopper so all beans are ground i would have rated this a 
excellent product i am sure glad that i purchased one of these it really comes in handy for alot of various cooking chores i especially enjoy roasting chickens with it 
erbabe don t hesitate to buy this light weight blanket it is wonderfully made the reason i m giving it a rating is that it fits my california king bed i ve looked high and low to find a blanket that fits this one does ! buy this blanket with confidence deffinately a great find on amazon and the price wasn t bad either 
great pan yes it s a really big pan ! a perfect cookware addition for the serious cook surprisingly the pan isn t as heavy as i expected and is a manageable size it will easily saute to chicken breasts at once without crowding and is perfect for large batches it heats evenly and lives up to the all clad quality i expected easy cleanup too ! highly recommended 
ok the second time around the first vacuum shipped to us arrived damaged but it was replaced quickly this vacuum has a lot of useful features without being too heavy only problem is that the main hose has a weak connection to the main vacuum canister so you end up just getting a lot of dust in the air 
great for hardwood laminates no more swiffing picks up all the pet hair dust bunnies and cat litter on my hardwood and laminate floors no problem the head also pivots very easily with a degree range which helps a lot when vacuuming around furniture i find i have to use the hand vac part has a handy crevice tool though to get stuff out of corners and along edges but it is a stick vac so this seems about right to me a minor drawback is that it doesn t stand up on its own so it is hard to switch between push and hand vac still i ll be getting rid of my swiffer 
rachel ray s qt oval pot this is a great product it really holds a lot and is great for stoups thicker than soup but thinner than stews and can hold meats like a pork tenderloin quite easily 
great shakers these are really great shakers they re pretty small though so don t plan on serving corn on the cob to people and expecting it to last through the dinner they look fantastic on a table display and really add flair to your decorating they re functional but they really could stand to be a little bigger i m happy with them though the plum are just gorgeous 
cup is exquisite and perfectly balanced in saucer i have this cup and am very satisfied with it the design is elegant and lovely to say the least i enjoy it very much 
inch model good for small cats my burmese kitten loves her little black petmate burrow bed it s relatively flat and hooded so she can stretch out of the opening or curl up against the hooded area as she pleases at first i was a little concerned about the construction of the bed because when she would cuddle into a corner of the bed the bed would tilt and leave her in a bizarre angle as the mattress area is fluffy and round but the more she sleeps on it the more the padding compresses down and now this is no longer a problem furthermore the entire lining hood and cushion cover is removable and washable very nicely constructed and highly recommended 
arrived on time the item i ordered arrived on time and as pictured so i would order from this seller again 
snow cone accessory kit it is everyhting i expected it to be and i appreciate the promptness in shipping it i received it yesterday 
hot plate the hot plate works well i use it in my smoker and i like the variable heat control the element does not sit flat without some weight on it that is the only small bad part over all a very good unit 
excellent quality and value i have enjoyed wine served in spiegelau stemware at several of my favorite restaurants so i decided to give them a try for the price these are really amazing the glass is nice and thin and the bowls are well shapedi now own several dozen of the bordeaux and burgundy in addition to the chardonnay one glass in one shipment had a broken stem but amazon sent me a replacement set via second day air immediately before i even had a chance to get to the post office and return the broken one pottery barrel sells glasses of significantly inferior quality for a lot more money 
very pleased great for larger tanks i have a gallon tank and sometimes i don t want to perform a water change to get the bottom of the tank clean i had the multi vac previously i have no issues with that except over time the pieces won t stay together i bought the sludge extractor petco and i love it it reaches to the bottom of my tank and i didn t have to drain any water the pressure on the vacuum was more than adequate i was a bit relunctant on the proce but i m happy i did buy it and would recommend it to others just shop around for the lowest price 
calphajon inch non wtick pan typical of calphalon the best non stick pan on the market as far as i m concerned excellent product 
satsified i have enjoyed the factory reconditioned kitchen aid i have put it to the test these past weeks to ensure it would stand up so far i have not had any problems from light mixing to bread making i have waited along time to purchase and this was in my price range i would do it again 
henckels knife block handsome and compact will fit the decor of most kitchens nice to have the knives out of the drawer 
i thought i must be crazy but would buy it all over again i love rice but never rice i made at home it never turned out well and i hated the cleanup the zutto makes perfect rice every time i make long grain brown and short grain sushi rice in mine and they all turn out great it cooks a pretty mean oatmeal too i thought i must be crazy for buying a rice cooker when you can buy other models for the zutto is made better and works better than any other non comercial cooker i have seen or had rice from though the rice does indeed turn out better than from other cookers and guests often comment that it is better tasting than from their own cookers rice turns out perfectly whether you wash it or not i prefer to wash white rice as i like the flavor better with the starch removed the keep warm feature works well too and you can keep the rice for hours without it drying out i have also become addicted to mccann s steel cut irish oatmeal since buying the zutto i have eaten it for breakfast every day that i have been at home since the first time i tried it mccanns is another delacacy thats time consuming to make on the stove and clean up with the zutto it s a snap i use two and a half cups of water to one cup of oats in the porridge mode i load the cooker at night and set the timer feature and wake up to the smell of oatmeal oh yea the timer feature you can set the time you want to eat and the zutto will adjust it s start time so it completes cooking at that time you can have freshly cooked rice waiting when you get home ready to go it automaticly goes into the keep warm mode when it s done cooking so even if your an hour or three late getting home you will arrive to perfect rice i do agree it should cost or a hundred bucks less but if it disapeared tomorrow i would immediately buy another one i started out storing it in my cabinet but have made space for it on the counter since i use it every day modt days twice it looks good enough that it doesn t look out of place too which is good 
no more stink it s a cool little tent it s cute keeps the area clean of litter sand and the it doesnt make it smell as bad anymore because there s the door that covers it except that the door only close half way yes i recommend you to get it 
loved it my best purchase greatr price nice features my friend i bought it for loves it do yourself a favor and purchase it 
great for diet shakes i bought two blend ngo cups so my husband and i could make smoothies and they worked great the one time we did it then we gave up real food and went on a liquid diet where you mix flavored powder with water the blend ngo cup is terrific for this we blend the powder with water and a few ice cubes and it makes the drink thick and frothy like a milkshake which tastes much better also there are different shake formulas for men and women so i can t just make up one batch for both of us the blend ngo makes it quick and easy to make two different drinks at once but only if you buy two of them 
best cheap crystal these are my standbys for entertaining look like waterford have a nice heft to them don t break easily when they do you don t cry i have been using these for years but needed replacements the price online including shipping was less than i could buy them for here 
excellent fryer i bought this fryer to make french fries at a small food concession i have wow ! it did a beautiful job on the fries and with the two baskets there s no hold up on customer orders the fries are done in about minutes and the customers love them i wish there was a more effective way to clean the elements but with the ease of using the fryer i ll make do with carefully wiping it down with a sudsy cloth 
good cleaner i only gave this four stars because this grease remover probably isn t necessary for most folks regular strength cerama bryte s pretty amazing all on it s own and it gets off all the tough stuff try it first then buy this if you find yourself using more elbow grease than you d like 
love fiestaware my husband suggested this as a birthday gift for me i thought okay until i opened the package this shamrock green is so pretty this dinnerware is great a nice heavyweight the glazing is brillant and the cereal bowls are a good size not too small as other types tend to be i am very happy i own this and have bought more since 
great fan for a great price we got this fan for our young daughter s bedroom and it works so well in there i really like how quiet it is and that it is sealed up well so small fingers won t get injured i have found the thermostat to be very useful i can leave it on all night and it goes off at the temp i have it set for so my daughter does not get cold we are now getting more one for the nursery and one for the kitchen i would recommend it for small spaces because as the other reviewers say it is not extremely powerful but overall a great fan for a great price 
fantastic having grown up with an old school pressure cooker tictictic i was a little reluctant to make the switch to this new fangled gadget however i was hooked after the first few quick and easy meals that i wouldn t have tried in the old one in a word beans the foaming problem that can make such a mess in the old models is almost perfectly solved by the new pressure release system once it comes up to pressure you can reduce the heat and keep everything going without spurting steam all over the place the little yellow button stays up you know when the cooker is pressurized and can adjust the heat to keep things moving along works like a charm 
getting salty in my kitchen product just as promised looks great works wonderful a very happy purchase from my en 
don t be surprised don t be surprised if you order this item and it doesn t come for a year ! i ordered this item in april and it is now july and i have yet to see it the delivery date keeps getting pushed back month after month 
world s greatest mixing bowl i own every size of this bowl and if they made more i d buy them in fact i m thinking about throwing away all my other bowls and just buying several more of these they are absolutely the greatest mixing bowls ever made they won t slide around the bottow is rubber or something like it they are steep sided so things don t splash out they are easy to clean and they look great i could just could go on and on with praise about these bowls i m years old and i cook a lot i ve never had a better product buy these you won t be disappointed 
mugs to match nice dishes who really uses cups and saucers any more maybe for a formal company dinner or fancy tea party the cups that come with the sets of mikasa antique white dishes hold ounces with sipping room these mugs hold ounces they have a great slim style and are made of a more refined china than most casual mugs one consideration they do not hold the heat like a big clunky mug so if you drink your coffee slowly you may be zapping it more often 
works great no more allergic reaction to my friends cat after using this air cleaner ! surprised the heck out of me but it beats my ionic breeze by a mile at a fraction of the cost allergy season is upon us so i m ordering another one tomorrow along with some extra filters it s just great finding an inexpensive solution to a miserable affliction 
great product this product saves me money on expensive vet bills because it works better than treatments i had received there zymox takes about a week to work with one or two treatments a day it has had the same effect for my sister s dog who had had recurrent ear infections i have also used the spray for skin infections with the same rate of success 
good bad ugly it works really well downsideconsumes a lot of electricity so use on the really cold nights not for full time sole heating use in my opinion but still cheap as a spot heater when needed noise not too bad and not nearly as loud as other reviews have noted acceptable we looked and looked comparing numerous products and frankly we re very satisfied quality good well made and a bargain at this price when compared to more expensive feature deprived competitors oh it s not ugly fits most rooms decor 
great knives we got this as a wedding present what a great gift ! i use these knives constantly but especially for cutting up meat or vegetables they are so sharp but even cut up baby tomatoes with ease the wood block is small enough to be stored on a counter top and not take up much space at all i m so happy we got these ! 
cusinart features less than older models we have owned the cup maker and we really needed the cup feature so bought this model we have only owned cuisnart brand coffee makers for the past years on this model we were disapointed we miss the control of tempature plate feature to keep your coffee on low med or hot also we noticed that grounds splash up onto to inside top cover and plugs the holes where the water sprays out for brewing the coffee and we have the clean them out but over all we love cusinart 
fresh step ease great product that makes everything so much easier and tidier our cats enjoy the crystal litter very much 
better than the new fangled things i ve been using neckbones for more than years always buying a spare in case my old one wears out my local store no longer carries them so i decided to look on line i was given one of those new squishy pillows as a gift and i tried it but there s no comparison i use my neckbone for traveling and sleeping due to a neck problem and i would never go anywhere without it 
fabulous cat toy this turbo scratcher is appealing to cats even if they reject most scratching posts the ping pong ball adds an element of excitement i have cats and they all like to play with this toy 
really makes a difference we just added this topper to our already cozy mattress and wow it made it even more comfortable it gives a great squish factor to the bed it also helps to buffer you from the movements of your sleeping partner it sort of absorbs their movements and keeps you perfectly unaffected the only thing that i have to say is that there is a new foam smell that will take over the bed it says to allow a little airout time but who can resist immediately putting on the bed i would definitely suggest this product 
stitches i received my new sewing machine and love the way it works i am not in love with the confusing directions on the sewing stitch functions to the best of my knowledge i really only have stitches possible there is no customer service number on my manual to talk to someone live and has led to frustration ultimately i still love the way the machine performs with or without the other stitches 
pleased got tired of can openers that left little burrs or that were difficult to get started hesitant about buying a as seen on tv product but went for it works well amuses my toddler and the dogs overall happy with product hope it lasts 
great buy i bought the toaster because consumer reports said that it was the best buy and they recommended it i also did a search for the best buy and found it at e bayi used it for the first time this morning and am very pleased with the product that i bought 
good deal this product was shipped promptly and was very easy to assemble it is economical for students and is everything the website described 
great cookware i am a senior who grew up with much heavier cast iron i had to give it up because of its weight these are still very good cookware but slightly lighter in weight therefore easier to handle and the pre seasoning is super i am sorry now that i didn t add a cover to my order thought my calphalon covers might work haven t found a good match for this size pan so keep that in mind if you do buy this will be used as i have traditionally used this size it will fry it will make pineapple upside down cake it will turn out a perfect meatloaf i am happy to again be using cast iron the original and best of the nonstick ware 
over thesink board the metal plastic coated rods at the ends of the board slide very easily inward and outward thereby subjecting the board to fall into the sink the board received had an elongated crack ! not worth my time and money to return ive learned a lesson ! 
perfect can opener i wish i had one of these years ago i could have saved a lot of money on all of those electrics that never really worked all that well and the handhelds that are just too ez to spill the contents of the can any one that can pick up a can will be able to use this thing it doesnt require any superhuman strentgh and it will hold up even large cans needs a good mounting surface i have mine screwed to the side of my cabinet next to my sink i think it is very well built and should last me my lifetime and then some sometimes the original is the best this is one of them 
compact sturdy and easy to use best deal for the money folds up easy we use it in the kitchen to reach high places it folds up and slides easily in next to the refrigerator stool is sturdy and does not slip on the floor when opened up great product 
happy pet owner the mattress tool is the most used tool from my dyson dc animal upright vacuum collection i inherited a cat who assumes my queen size bed is hers i use this tool on the mattress mattress pad feather bed sheets while still on the bed pillow cases left on the pillows pillows and my beloved quilts and shams easiest to clean while left on bed it really saves time and my washer and dryer i used to double and triple wash to get rid of the cat hair and have to clean hair out of the washer each time i even use it on clothing i put them on a hanger and hold the bottom down while gliding the tool downward i also have a yr old german shepherd who sheds a lot i use the mini turbine head to clean her super sized bed and twin sized sheets easiest while still on bed i also have the low reach floor tool fantastic for getting pet hair from under my heavy furniture i ve owned a lot of vacuums and dyson is by far the best out there for pet owners i use all of the tools and they are great i hardly ever used the tools on my other uprights because they didn t seem to get enough suction to do the job right after years of struggling to keep up with all of the pet hair now i can get the job done in no time and the results are a truly clean house i ve actually reversed the damage to my carpets from embedded pet hair dyson is powerful enough to pull out the pet hair another good point dyson is the cleanest vacuum to use no spilled dirt while emptying the dirt bin like my other two bagless vacuums and no nasty filters to wash every time you vacuum how good can it possibly get 
great crate but be careful with teething puppies the crate is overall nice light convenient to setup and fold for transport the pockets are great and handy to keep clutter out of sight the only criticism would be the mesh on the sides isn t bulletproof strong seems to be a tough coated plastic mesh but my bulldog who is teething was able to chew a small hole through it which if she continues would render the crate unusable if your dog is not a chewer it s a great product if he she is be wary of this or just spray bitter apple on it after i did she has stopped 
great made my knives sharper than new worked very well on serrated knives extremely quick and easy to use highly recommende 
gold box for the bedskirt the bedskirt is the bonus in this set that makes this worth looking at if you have furnished rental property and don t use platform beds stock up 
if yours needs fixing i bought for friends for christmas and neither worked the problem is the plastic tube inside the pump handle gets a memory kink in it that s super easy to fix to fix it remove the one phillips screw then remove the cap at the hose end the cap end this one is a bit tough to get off and the one on the nozzle the handle will then open like a clam shell pull the handle back and remove the plastic hose you will immediately see the crimp in the hose massage it a bit and work it out put it back in by lifting the handle and try to get the hose in a different spot than the original kink you don t have to go very far put it back together with a bit of finessing in reverse order tada easy breezy jc 
dirt devil vision self propelled the dirt devil vision self propelled is the best vacuum in the world for carpets not bare floors it does a loisy job on bare floors it is better then any dyson or any hoover or the expensive kirbyvacc you ask why why indeed first of all you probably gotsucked or suckered into believing that suction is the most important thing in a vacuum right no im afraid not its all in the beater bar brush the faster it goes the better it will clean your carpets all the so called suction does is remove what the beater bar brush pulls out yes the better the suction the faster it gets rid of what the brush pulls up mr dyson seems to think that suction is all that matters its not dyson vacuums are poor on rugs becausethefloatingheadon them doesnt get down far enough to get the really deep down dirt like the dirtdevil vision self propelled also an important thing is having a solid line of brush on the beater bar the others like dyson or hoover well theyvegot gaps in there brushes why who knows maybe they think there is better air movement or something cosumer rates that the hoover windtunnel self propelled is the best vacuuminthere tests well i have that model too and yes it does do a good job but it doesntdeep clean like the dirt devil the drive belts also burn outreally quick so its hard to push and pull the cons of the dirt devil vision are this yes its noisy yes its bad on bare floors yes you have to clean the filter ihappento clean mine with another vaccum or i use my air compressor to blow it off i have a very big house and have tested vacuums for years i have a dyson dc animal a hoover windtunnel and a kirby by the way the selfpropelled motor doesntuse a belt like hoovers windtunnel i tell you folks for carpets its the best ivehad it for years the hoover for years and the dyson for months and the kirby for a year you will find that nothing pulls out more then that machine nothing for the money u can buy a dirtdevil vision at your local walmart for pretty cheep the design is one of the best easy to empty dirt container the self propelled feature is much better then the hoovers windtunnel why these other reviewers say the belts burn out fast is beyond me i vacuum every day or everyother day because i have pets and my wife has got allergies just to let you know the dyson is a good machine but dosnt have the power a dirt devil has you turn that dirt devil on and you can feel the floor just vibrate and you can hear that beater bar just going like crazy on the floor if you buy one youll be in a shock as to what youll pull out of your carpets and people this vac like most other bagless vacs have filters of some sort they do have to be cleaned now and then the dirt devils suction is very good and it doesnt lose suction very fast the only way it ever would is if you never clean the damn thing thats the price people that you pay for bagless vacs clean the filter once a week or every two weeks depending on how much you use it again i use mine almost everyday and i clean the filter once a week if you never clean the filter you know it probably would do a poor job after seeing the other reviews im very interested in finding out how theres seem to be falling apart or not running very well ive owned mine for years and never had any problems yes ive changed the belt on it and have bought a new filter for it now and then but im wondering why these other people are having such difficulty folks the vac is like anything if you take care of it it will last i mean the things got one belt and one filter how hard is that i suppose if you beat the hell out of it i suppose it could brake dum da dum dum dumm 
dirt devil m power reach this is the best vacuum on the market for removing cat hair from your furniture and bedspread it is far above using a pet hair remover tape it is great for the quick cleanups of tracked litter as well i love it 
just what i have been looking for i have had the more well known travel mugs and thought that they were the best well i was wrong this travel mug is by far the best out there it is truly leak proof my friends get tired of me turning it upside down i guess i m easily amused hehe but i really do like a mug that won t spill if tipped over when turned to the drink side the liquid flows at about the right rate not too fast not too slow anyway i can t say enough about this mug and the price also beats the competition 
great utensil perfect size and weight for a skillet keeps the bacon chops flat for even frying while preventing any splatters high quality materials you won t cook bacon again without this indespensible utensil easy stars for this great product 
so useful i bought two sets after two plus decades i finally decided to replace my wood utensils though they had served me well they were no cracked and splintering i was considering nylon or silicone utensils to replace them but about the same time i had purchased a bamboo cutting board and really loved it so i checked out bamboo utensils and found these very nice and reasonably priced tools first they are great with all types of cookware whether traditional or nonstick and the burnished bamboo surface is very tough it doesn t mind high heat or the dishwasher i also like the bamboo container it s small enough to place anywhere in the kitchen i have on set by the stove and another on my prep table the only thing i wish it had was a deeper spoon or ladle for serving 
well made generous sized makes roasting nearly fool proof fabrication quality is very good with polished exterior machine turned base sturdy handles and thick walls because it s aluminum it s not so heavy that handling it becomes awkward slip even a large bird with ease into this roaster sprinkle with spices pour a can of chicken broth into the bottom and roast in a degree oven for three and a half to four hours with the lid on then raise the temp to and take the lid off for another minutes or so your bird is perfectly moist throughout delicately crisped on top and clean up is quick and easy whats not to like 
wow i read the reviews on this item and everyone loved it except one person still i decided to try it i love it it really makes the room first off delivery was very quick and assembly was very easy second all the pre drilled holes did line up the color is great with just one small scratch but i zapped it with some wood cleaner and it s barely noticeable definitely a wonderful addition to my dining set 
we really like this sugar dispenser we were given one of these sugar dispenser for a gift and now we just bought two more to give out as gifts we love it however i couldn t give it an actual five stars as we do have some problems with the sugar leaking out a little and being somewhat messy however it is great to keep the children from using too much sugar i would recommend it 
a great way to prevent a fire i purchased this for my mother who has melted more than one pan on her stove and has collection pot and pans with delaminated bottoms she finds this timer very easy to set and very good at waking her when she wears it around her neck 
ove glove i love no more burnt fingers and the price special was just right as well get one or two 
r nelson this blender is super it has all the bells and whistles one could want 
not a bad find since it was a gift i did not mind spending the money on this set even though i may have found it somewhere else for a bit less it is the exact color scheme i was looking for they were shipped almost immediately they are cotton and fairly absorbent so definately functional as well as pretty 
great value dessert wine glass these aren t as nice as some of the specialty wine glasses but for the money these are the best port glasses on the market lead perhaps a concern in a long term decanter but not from a non soluable port glass 
love this appliance nice space saving design toaster toasts better than any regular toaster i have owned recently looks smart too 
i love my sunbeam toaster i had a sunbeam toaster for many years and it finally stopped working properly i went shopping and could not find a sunbeam anywhere so i bought another brand and did not like it took it back and got a different brand which i also did not like i kept it for about months and got on line determined to find a sunbeam which i did and as i said i love my sunbeam toaster ! it met all my expectations of sunbeams products and i will stick with it from now on thank you 
nordicware inch micro go round if your microwave oven does not have a built in turntable the nordicware micro go round is the perfect solution 
great cookware this cookware is nice and heavy and sturdy it heats much faster than the cheaper cookware we had before it also heats very evenly the only negative thing i have to say is that the food sticks to these pans quite a bit more than it would in teflon however i think that one negative is greatly outweighed by the positive and a little oil or pam fixes the problem 
mickey wafflemaker acquired this item as a christmas gift and the recipient was very pleased with it the wafflemaker works fine and makes a waffle that is just the right size for a child or anyone for that matter wished that it had a little more detail but that is a small matter if the finished product is good eating 
highly recommended cooks illustrated highly recommends this sheet its their first choice im just looking for a store i can buy it at ! 
wonderful rolling hamper this clothers hamper on wheels was just what i was looking for i had just installed a clothesline in our backyard with the intention of line drying heavier items like towels wet towels are heavy this hamper is just perfect for my need i load the wet towels into it from the washing machine in our garage and roll it right out the back door into the yard for hanging i had seen the reviews about difficult assembly but mine went together quite easily and is holding up well so far the only drawback for me is the off white canvas is rather boring i had seen a lesser product made with a printed fabric but all in all it has been just great 
best little fan ever i love this little fan it s perfect for cooling one person i have it on my nite table and use it every night amazingly quiet and soothing air 
great sheets for a great price ! deep pockets i got these at a great price so my expectations were very low i usually spend as much as for a pair of high thread count cal king sheets but it seems they wear very quickly so i started shopping for an alternative i ran across these i really thought they were going to be cheap scratchy but they are not not only are they plenty soft they are beautiful ! the embroidery is a lovely touch my only complaint is that they have sold out or i would have bought at least another sets for future use ! i love the mint color it is very pretty i was also afraid they would not fit over my deep mattress featherbed on top but there is ample room for both they fit much better than the expensive sheets i have bought in the past i don t have to work up a sweat to make the bed anymore by pulling tugging until i get the fitted sheet on the bed i would definately recommend these you will be pleasantly surprised ! 
awesome awesome awesome awesome the money tree arrived today on time it was a gift to me i opened the box and couldn t believe how perfect this tree was i m going to have to purchase some more of these soon especially for the holidays the roots on this smaller tree are as nice as the roots on a bigger tree thanks 
great pan i loved this pan it is really solid and it cleans up so well for being stainless and not a non stick service also i love all clad 
fast service i was impressed with the fast efficient service when i ordered this sleeveboard also it works wonderfully well much better than the old wooden ones 
great for little ones i have to say i loved these at first but after only a few months of use all of mine have broke the little white sticks that shape the box broke through the seems at the top i could stitch them closed but now my kids think they are for sword fighting i am disappointed i would still give them stars if they held up but now i would have to go down to i wasn t sure if this would work for my yr old because they collapse to my suprise they are working better the biggest problem i have is him dumping his toys flipping over the toy boxes and standing on them this is not very safe right since the top of the dresser is usually where he goes whats worse is you spend or bucks on the plastic ones and he stands on the side and breaks them and they take up alot of space these boxes are primary colors perfect for kids large and they can t stand on them because they just won t hold a kids weight perfect for me when you open them up be careful to check inside because they are packed with silica gel bags each of mine had not good eats for a toddler i think they are great and i am getting a few more 
a delight to use i love this grinder it s very easy on the hands grinds consistently and plentifully i don t seem to have the problems some others have had with the output lets me have salt and pepper right at hand in one container and looks good i have the stainless model im here to buy another one for a friend right now 
elegant dinnerware this item was more than i expected i received all the pieces that was advertised the color of the plates were not a red that i expected but more of a burnt orange color 
fabulous espresso lattes cappucinos for a great price i bought the delonghi bar a little over a year ago while a nice little machine that made excellent espresso you do get what you pay for the plastic frother attachment would wear down and become ineffective finally a little over a year after purchase the boiler died so i decided to bite the bullet and get a higher priced version i was not disappointed ! the stainless frother attachment is super quiet and easy to clean i love illy e se pods and looked for a machine that would accommodate these no mess no fuss on busy work days ! great crema quiet machine and overall nice look it is a little big and the water tank is a little difficult to pull up especially if it is stored under the cabinets on the counter like mine but it is not a big deal my good friends have a machine and i have to say this produces the same quality espresso takes up less counter space and is a better value buy it you won t be disappointed 
betta kit i have bought this kit two years ago and have had a betta live for two years it was the best deal and the perfect size for a betta the only thing you need is the fish ! over all it fits in tight spots and is very durible and easy to clean 
superrrrrrrrrrr this was a great price and a great quality product i put these in the back yard just under the overhang of the porch roof and you would be amazed on how much light you get its perfect i bought two and it puts out plenty on light a real nice mood and atmosphere around the pool area from a very happy customer 
little goofy but great hot coffee my wife called me complaining about the same problem the previous reviewer had with the carafe being pushed way from the machine once she aligned the carafe lid properly it did not happen again this machine produces very hot excellent coffee its a little big the carafe system is awkward and there is no beeper to tell you when the coffee is done it just shuts off after minutes however the combination of the timer and the carafe insure an excellent hot cup of coffee every morning the coffee is as good as any shop and its very hot even in small cup batches no more burnt coffee taste yeah ! an added bonus is that this machine also looks cool on the counter 
scooba floor washer i bought this product because i liked the vaccumn so much it stood up to my expectations 
pleased i am very pleased with the chemire dinnerware set it is very durable and the colors are great the dishes are larger than i had expected they are a little heavy due to the size and thickness i would recommend them to others 
mice are nice these colorful and furry little mice are great for cats that enjoy chasing small toys they are treated with catnip but to be honest i don t think my cat knows the difference unlike their zanies furry mice counterparts zanies rainbow mice also rattle since they have tiny pebbles inside them a word of caution about this though the pebbles are encased inside a semi rigid plastic cartridge which makes up the body of the mouse the furry fabric is simply wrapped around this plastic piece and glued after my cat played with one of the mice the fabric unglued itself and the plastic was exposed since there are pebbles inside unsupervised play might not be very safe it s best to regularly check the condition of the mice after the cats play with them other than that these are great toys and the price quantityquality ratio is pretty good quantity is important here because due to their small size most mice will most likely end up lost behind some piece of furniture since you get mice in this package you can just keep replacing the ones that go missing in action in the long run it s a lot cheaper than buying them individually 
just what i had been searching for the first order for this arrived damaged and had to be sent back and replaced the second shipment arrived in better shape and is exactly what i was searching for however it had a broken shelf which was replaced i am a very satisfied customer as the cabinet was exactly what i wanted however i was disatisifed with the packaging and shippment process due to the damage although i must admit the company was very responsive to my return and replacement needs 
disney cars pillow i sent as a gift was told the baby loves the soft pillow 
kitchen aid piece cutlery set this set is a great addition to my kitchen it s functional and adds a great red accent to the countertop matching my other kitchenaid appliances i highly reccommend it 
great for tea too i ve had one of these cups for about three years and it works great 
i don t use them for canning i use them with my foodsaver vacuum sealer ! these jars are perfect for anything from grated cheese flour sugar nuts oats cereal chips anything you can think of that is bulky they work exceptionally well with grated cheese i like to buy lb blocks of tillamook cheddar get out the food processor and grate the whole block then store in the jars in the fridge vacuum sealed the grated cheese will keep for over a month easy without drying out or molding cheaper than the pre grated and less preservatives too love my wide mouth jar attachment in conjunction with these ball canning jars 
good for the price these pillows are pretty good for the price yes they do get flattened but i have a few of them together in different colors on the couch and they are decorative and comfortable they are very soft and look great together i may get more because of the great price so far i have not had any come apart at the seams my cat tends to be rough on pillows by chewing and scratching and so far my similar pillows with the fringe are his favorite but these ones have lasted nicely 
review for kitchenaidkfpob watt cup food processor onyx i love my new kitchenaid processor it is wonderful and works fantastic ! i recieved a great price on it in comparison to the local stores and even received a special day promotion code plus a rebate ! all in all it was my best buy of the year thanks to amazon com 
the ultimate kitchen knife i must say this is one fantastic knife it is the knife i usually use when prepping a meal sandwiches don t count when i purchase a knife i always personally sharpen it so i can t really speak for the factory edge but it accepts and holds an edge wonderfully having the extra wide knife along with added heft has more of a curve to it allowing for an easy chopping motion i have purchased henckel pro s in the past and after noticing a couple of flaws that passed their qc in my expensive knives i will never purchase one without personally inspecting it first wusthof has much better qc so i have no problem ordering them through the mail fyithis knife needs a large cutting board and a serious knife block to hold it i personally use the wusthof slot mega block and it fits in all three of the top chef knife positions overall this knive is an investment but you will love it ! 
simple toy loaded with countless hours of entertainment my cat loves this toy she can t walk past it without tapping it with her paw if you just shake this toy and she hears the ball moving within the plastic she comes running even if she s napping she can t get enough of this toy and its very comical to see her playing with it its like watching a kitty play twister because they have so many places to put their paws and they want that ball so bad get this toy ! it will bring you and your cat hours of entertainment ! 
great little scissors i used these scissors for cutting off the fins and tail of tilapia sp and these worked wonderfully on cutting through those needle like bones ! my last pair of cooking scissors broke while in the process of cutting ! these are really great for any purpose ! sharp too 
better than advertised i love my cat but detested the cat box after reading the reviews i bought this and it is the best buy of the year ! no smell my cat took to it right a way after i ordered i bought a box of the crystal litter and put it on top of her litter by the time this box came in she was ready ! no smell and it last over the suggested days almost makes me want to get another cat 
nonstick pan this was a christmas gift so we haven t used the pan often yet the two times it has been in service it performed very well it s deep enough to hold sauces and soups without running out of room and the clean up is a breeze the weight of the pan is what we ve come to expect from calphalon products too it is a great choice 
microwave cook set i have been happily surprised with the ease of cleaning and performance of these products i cook lots of eggs in the microwave and dread soaking and cleaning the dishes nordicware is the easiest clean no soaking or scrubbing necessary great dishes 
bark stop pro works with big dogs we have large dogs who are so sweet but end up barking at noisy neighbors with children playing in the field behind our home and a neighbor next to us who is always complaining about our dogs barking so we decided the best thing would be to buy a bark curbing device we ordered the bark stop pro and almost immediately our dogs stopped barking we were so tired of trying to get them to stop the nuisance barking and we love our dogs so we re very thankful that this device works you have to use the high frequency for the big dogs we would recommend this product to anyone who has a large barking dog 
stand mixer this stand mixer is absolutely wonderful everything about it has been worth it a huge price difference from kitchen aid and quality is just as good as this other name brand well worth the money i use it all the tim 
very nice for the price my husband put this table together in under minutes and it is very nice for the price we have it displayed in our living room and it goes really well with our safari theme now if only i could find a similiar sofa console table i d be good to go 
good low end but check out new vivants i got a bunch of overtures when amazon was discounting them heavily but never did like the stumpy proportions now riedel has apparently come out with a new low end line vivant that it is selling through target which is available through amazon web site for about the same price it appears that you get a somewhat better glass 
the ultimate pillow this is the only pillow i have ever found regardless of price that gives me complete sleeping comfort this pillow and i go back many many years and i could not find it again in retail stores today i received only two what was i thinking from amazon and immediately ordered two more for our cabin this is a no brainer buy sweet dreams 
sturdy and beautiful the picture doesn t quite do the coloring justice the bottom of the pitcher is much darker than the top ranging from a deep brown red to a beatifully vivid fire engine red at the top the size is just right for sangria for four or a dozen dahlias as a pitcher the handle is large and comfortable and the spout is well designed and prevents those irritating drips that happen with shorter spouts as a vase it ll win you a zillion compliments my cats have managed to knock it over a couple times even though it s quite heavy and there s not a chip to be seen this says more about the determination of the cats than about the weight or balance of the pitcher 
a cute addition to my kitchen it s not made in france but i guess it will do its job 
better than the garbage i bought one of these for my apartment and it s quite an investment considering the constant cost of refills it does contain the odor better than a garbage can but does not completely eliminate it the instructions seem a bit confusing at first but it s a piece of cake once you figure out what they are trying to show with that in mind it s a step in the right direction and does a fair job of containing the odor particularly for indoor environments and is a better alternative than the hooded litterbox for kitty s respiratory system 
all clad pots are tops all clad pots are wonderful the shorter pans with thick cored bottoms make excellent jam pots as they deliver very good heat distribution good heat distribution is necessary for cooking full flavored jams preserves or butters without good heat distribution you run the risk of burn spots on the pan s surface these burn spots may will impart an unwanted flavor to your product if you ve ever tried to disguise burned jam you know it s a losing battle while some cooks may consider all clad pots or pan to be too expensive i believe they are well worth the cost as you are less likely to burn your product one good pan is worth more than six cheapies besides quality equipment instills confidence and makes you feel like a seasoned chef 
love the prompt and secured service from amazon though i have not tried the juicer yet but i could not pass off the price 
the best this is the best mattress pad i have gotten it fits well feal s well and i would buy it again thank you 
great frame the frame has many options for display and has a good sized internal memory would recommend int highly to all large crisp display and can even be used as a clock 
solid and sturdy it does what you want a toaster oven to do broil toast and bake those are the three things i look for my toaster to do it does all of them just fine i like the bottom crumb pan which helps to keep those nasty burnt crumobs from ruining your toaster 
i wish i would have bought this years ago this is an excellent product if you are tired of lugging buckets of water back and forth while cleaning your aquarium and making huge messes walking in puddles etc and taking hours to clean even relatively small tanks this product is for you don t waste your money on cheap suction devices and buy the python today ! sorry if i sound like an infomercial i m just an enthusiastic user the python attaches to your faucet you turn the water on full blast stick the suction tube end into your tank and you can drain your tank in minutes or just vacuum your gravel and do partial water changes then you flick a switch and you can fill your tank back up again in minutes i have nine gallons and a gallon as well as a gallon turtle tank and what used to take me a whole day now takes about an hour to do all tanks i like that i can vacuum the gravel boy does this thing suck the waste up this will also prolong the use of your filters and make your tank look great ! i was skeptical that this product would work but am so glad that i bought it now i actually enjoy maintaing my tanks instead of dreading it the directions are easy to follow even for people like me who are direction impaired 
chopped ice and a conversation piece since we do not have a through the door ice dispenser with an automatic ice crusher yet had a pressing need for crushed ice for our mojitos i began a quest for a sturdy and effective ice crusher after trying several of the plastic ones out there i found this one and am happy with it the price was right it looks good sitting on my bar shelf and most importantly it chops ice well it is a little smaller than i expected but the hopper holds enough of my freezer s half moon cubes to fill a drink glass if you are looking to crush ice for a food platter this is not your machine due to volume it does require a bit of strength but jams are easily overcome by turning the crank in the opposite direction one warning the handle comes very close to the base so you do have to be careful not to catch a knuckle at the bottom of a turn 
it s hard being green although the dishes are not as green as i anticipated they are lovely i ordered a natural set for a mix match look from a catalogue store and they were not any nicer although they were considerably more expensive so now i am ordering a natural set of these i agree with one of the other reviewers that the antiquing is not as subtle as i would like but it s good enough for the price i love them ! 
diversity i ordered sets of this ithems i hope lots of different painting but i received same flower except diversity everything is excellent 
fiestaware brings color to life this is a great set of dinnerware after years my husband and i decided to bring some color into our lives by replacing our wedding gift white corelle with festive fiestaware how lovely to open the cabinets and see color we ve mixed colors and have an eight piece display of color fiestaware is not only beautiful but durable and it can be put in the dishwasher microwave oven and freezer it may cost a bit more than some of the trendy stuff available but it s adaptability to all uses makes it a fabulous value if you are at all tempted by it buy it you will love it ! put some color in your life 
my banana s still think they are on the tree do your banana s turn brown and mushy before you have a chance to eat them this used to be a huge problem in my house but now that i have the lipper beechwood collection banana hanger this is no longer an issue i hang my bananas up the moment i get home from the grocery store they think they are still on the tree out in the wild ! silly bananas green bananas turn yellow quicker when they are hanging and yellow ones stay yellow longer once i got a bunch of those little mini bananas and those even fit on the hanger the lipper beechwood collection banana hanger is compact and doesn t take up much counter space which is a definite plus and it s almost like art in my kitchen putting those bananas on display 
mr heater propane guage this product should be labeled as a mr heater propane guage it does not measure the level of liquid propane in your tank however it does measure the ability of the vaporized flow of propane gas to keep up with the usage of your propane appliance the red yellow and green indicator disk on the circular dial makes it easy to see how your propane use is doing before you completely run out its debatable if you need to know exactly how much liquid propane is still in the tank the vaporization indicator on this guage has been useful for me 
rachels knives are the best wow what a christams gift for my wife ! she watches rachel ray buys her cookbooks and makes her quick and wonderful dishes and i must admit they are great ! my wife has not stopped using the knives ! she claims they are the sharpest knives she s ever used and has warned me several times to be careful when using they re lightweight and tough they keep an edge and are fantastic for slicing chopping or cutting i found out about them from a wife of a friend who said the same thing ! they re definitely worth the expense and to my wife keep on chopping and cooking baby i ll eat every bite ! 
great juicer this is my second juicer i had a waring pro before this and thought that one was good but after getting this one i am pleasantly surprised with the amount of juice we get out of it its fast and efficient because of the big mouth if you follow the instructions and place a plastic bag in the pulp container it makes it that much easier to clean up afterwards it is relatively easy to clean but as with any product it is easier to clean it as soon as you are done 
revere cookware revere makes great cookware if you stay away from their budget line this makes the second quart that i own of theirs 
floor mate as the other reviewer said necessary to run your floormate check out lowe s the price 
micro suede duvet cover set i just love it and it looks great on my be 
a great food processor i bought this as a gift for my wife for christmas and she absolutely loves it she couldn t believe the price that i got it for given the size and blades after reading other reviews of this and a black decker i chose the hamilton beach we have already used it quite a bit and no problems at all the suction cups on the bottom hold the machine firmly in place overall a great purchase 
perfect i bought the matching bench a couple months ago for my new place and i love it recently i was in the market for a table to hold a lamp in my entry way and came across the plant stand i didn t need anything too large and found the height on this item to be perfect as an alternative to a floor lamp i put it together myself in less than a half hour and boy is it sturdy with extra storage and display space too it is absolutely perfect for my needs you won t be sorry with this piece for any purpose 
old is new again i purchased a refurbished eureka boss upright and found it to be as good as new ! we have two dogs with fur flying in short hairs sticking and embedding into the rugs this upright has such great capabilities with dog hairs i feel like my efforts of starting up the vacuum are now worth the effort i love the ease of switching from rug suction to cleaning tools suction it is the most user friendly one i have ever used i recommend the refurbished vacuum to all it was worth every penny and shipping was very quick with this company 
makes jerky fun this makes jerky making fun and easy simple to use and easy to clean when you re done 
tea rose oval vegetable bowl this bowl is absolutely beautiful i also like the size of the bowl and the beautiful tea rose pattern i highly recommend it 
wont regret it it s a great tool i am so glad that i bought it 
these towels are wonderful i ordered the shadow green and i love the soft green color it is beautiful ! the towels are thick abosorbent and luxurious feeling 
nice product but could be a little more flexible i have a sort of spatula addiction i own far too many spatulas and always buy more looking for the perfect spatula this one is a solidly good spatula i like that it is wide enough to turn any food that i cook it is excellent with delicate food like fish crab cakes or risotto cakes the width of this spatula would make it difficult to use in a tiny pan i haven t had any problem with pan size because i use mostly inch pans and wider the bottom inch of the spatula is flexible and after that it is rigid this spatula is a little thicker than i would like it to be but if it were thinner it might be too flexible i would like this spatula to be just a little more flexible this spatula has been used most days in my kitchen for the last months and so far is showing not signs of wear it is holding up better than most of the other nylon spatulas that i have purchased in the past overall this is good spatula that i would recommend 
excellent ! lives up to its name i was looking for a more conveniently disposable litter since i live on the top floor of my apartment building and making a trip to the dumpster every day to dispose of his duty was very annoying i looked into automatic cat boxes and litter lockers but they were too bulky and expensive when i discovered wbcl at the pet store i was skeptical of its effectiveness since it s all natural it was nothing but great ! i put my cat on it cold turkey and he had no problem with it it clumps well and truly is flushable i ve had no problems the odor control is good as long as you scoop regularly which you have no excuse not to do all litters track but a tracking pad will take care of that i feel so much better that it s environmentally friendly and healthier for my cat and myself highly recommended 
great cup of coffee i purchased this coffee pot after a lot of consideration i was very concerned about the comments regarding cleaning the grinding bay you do have to clean it after every use but it can be rinsed and put in the dishwasher or just rinsed and dried however the effort it takes to clean the unit does not compare to the great coffee that you get it makes hands down the best coffee i have ever had from a standard coffee pot ! 
treated myself today ! and a question well i did it went out and bought the qt in cherry red i m still sitting here looking at it ! i already own one piece of le creuset which together with everyone s comments enticed me to buy this absolutely amazing stuff at the risk of sounding like a total moron does anyone out there have a tip on how to remove the le creuset banner sticker on the side of the pot with my last piece i soaked the darn thing for a couple hours but it still lingered on what do they use superglue with these things 
i like them but who chose the name i like these dishes like others have said the colors have nothing to do with pewter they look more like shades of tan and brown i like these colors much better than pewter i asked my sixteen year old son what color they were and he said dark lavender or brown and tan i have always liked corelle because they are durable and lightweight and have been searching for a pattern that i like i m very pleased with the colors i ordered sets and now that i ve seen them i m ordering more sets 
an excellent product at less then i have never seen a product that performed better ! i cooked two eggs in my w microwave on power for minutes the instructions didn t have a chart for a w microwave so i did a little experimenting i would have given the item five stars but the eggs did stick a little the instructions said they wouldn t but it was very minor stickage nothing a paper towl and some hot water wouldn t fix buy this product ! i m going to get me another one or two 
as described awesome i have had different bread machines all of them had the single paddle upright loaf style i didn t mind the bread they turned out but i didn t like the loaf shape my prayers have been answered ! i can t quit making bread now ! the loaves come out perfect and if they don t i have come to relize that with bread it is typically the cook s error not the machine s you need to really read the directions which i find most people don t if you are going to spend this kind of money on a bread machine you better be willing to spend some time getting used to it i ve made all kinds of sweet sourdough french italian herb and cheese fruit and beer breads in the machine you name it and they all come out just fine if not i tweak the recipe i don t blame the machine all in all an excellent product this is my favorite bread machine so far the only down side is the sourdough setting don t be fooled the light sourdough is made by adding vinegar for true sourdough you have to wait the days but if you can t wait oh and the big viewing window unless someone installs a light inside the machine you can t really see what s going on anyway after my first loaves i will let you know how it s holding up 
great inflatable bed so far we are very happy with this inflatable bed we inflated it about a week before mom came to visit it did not leak i used it to nap on a couple of times it is very comfortable as long as it is not fully inflated when it becomes too hard mom slept on it for nights no problems she was so comfortable that when the guest sofa bed became available she elected to remain on the aerosport weekender twin bed it is high enough to sit on which is nice the stabilizers help a lot or it would roll too much the only problem with the stabilizers is that you have to remember they are there or you can trip on them all in all a very nice inflatable bed 
crispy dry lettuce rocks it does a great job of spin drying leafy vegetables yum 
unbelievable i ve been an amazon customer for about a decade now but this is the first time i ve written a review i feel i just have to this toy is so amazing i bought the cat track months ago but my cat has not lost interest she plays with this thing all day and even lets me sit and hit the ball with her this is by far the best toy i ve purchased for my cat 
love this unit this lives up to it s great reviews it is beautiful and works fantastically and matches very nicely with my decor highly recommended it will scratch easily though so be careful 
great everyday wine glass this glass is not really ideal for any wine but it s a great everyday glass for everyday use and it s an excellent tasting glass while you ll want to pull out your special grape specific glasses for those special bottles this glass is excellent for getting the most out of everyday wines with a minimum of fuss they fit in the top rack of most dishwashers and are very durable ive used them for the past years plus when you are drinking that special bottle from your special glasses it makes a very nice water glass 
pretty cool and efficient humidifier i ve owned this humidifier for a couple of months now the features that i like best about it are it regulates the ambient humidity ie the unit has a humidity sensor for the room when it reaches the desired level it automatically stops the mist also it gives you an indication when the unit needs to be cleaned pretty simple process and most important the unit stops when there s not enough water again a little indicator flashes for your attention furthermore the unit is very well designed and has a very contemporary look highly recommended 
good support this neck pillow offers considerable support under the neck bought it to replace an old one that had become thread barehusband uses it all the time 
nice towels i like these towel however the color is green i thought is would be more of a grey or silve 
beautiful the picture on the website really doesn t do them any justice they are beautiful and tough and i m so glad i got them 
sturdy easy to inflate and deflate pretty comfy i easily inflated the aerobed when i received it i like how you can just plug the inflater into the wall my old one required big heavy batteries the pillow that inflates is a good height i had worried that it would be too high it inflates into a real sized tall bed ! and doesn t topple over because there are two inflated support tubes on the bottom of each side i haven t slept on it yet but i did recline on it and it was very comfortable i certainly recommend it 
wusthof slicer was a christmas gift for my son inlaw and he was very pleased this is the second wusthof knive i have given him excellent 
love love love these sheets i had no idea these sheets would be such a great quality at such an unbelievable price shipping was fast the sheets fit more than perfect and i find myself can t waiting to go to bed at night to feel the softness and smoothness of this quality sheet ! i will definately buy this product again paulett 
inch skillet lid i am completely satisfied with this quality product and the prompt delivery 
this was a gift i had this shipped to my mother she had no complaints 
rivet great item does its job in the kitchen looks great as well love all calphalon products 
finally finally a coffeemaker that works and is easy to operate it s clean too no nooks and crannies to gunk up with coffee residue the blue light is nice at night it alluminates the kitchen just enough so that i won t run into anything but most of all the coffee is brewed to perfection everytime i have used it at least times and it s a breeze to clean i love this machine thank you denis 
great vacuum cleans like crazy pros easy to use very adaptable system tools and manual cleaning system are at your fingertips very long power cord and attachment hose incredible suction emptying the bin is trivial and essentially a clean process contrary to competitor claims dyson vacs do not spew dust into the house in fact the lifetime filter is user cleanable making the whole unit basically cost free again a trivially simple process consthis thing sucks so hard that it s difficult to push on deep pile carpet i called dyson about this and they had me remove two very thin seals from the beater bar head the result completely fixed the issue there was no apparent loss of cleaning capability the power cord is exceptionally long unfortunately it does not automagically retract the long cord can get in ones way however one does not have to move it from plug to plug as much yes it s plastic but other reviews have indicated reliability and good support from dyson both my wife and i find the dyson to be an excellent purchase we ve had lots of problems with vacuums because of three dogs and long haired humans this machine does a much better job of things and is much easier to use worth the money time will tell the reason why we selected dyson is because of all the good reviews all over the net so far it has exceeded our expectations 
greatest ever i burned up countless lesser spatulas before i found this one try as i might i can not damage it not even in cast iron cookware get one and see for yourself 
fiestaware bread tray this bread tray is just the right size and the perfect finishing touch to a table set with fiestaware 
great these storage bowls have been a nice addition to my dish collection they came in great shape and have been useful they go from firdge to microwave to the table and everything matches the dishes 
fiesta this is a great idea ! everyone should have at least one of these personally i d get one for every member of the household the well is perfect so theres no slipping or sliding and it can easily be carried without having to worry about it falling off we love this and this is a great color so much prettier than the picture 
good value large capacity works as advertised a bit larger than anticipated but otherwise has met my expectations i haven t had any issues with the filtering if you don t need a large capacity check out t fals smaller capacity ez cleani mostly fry fish chicken french fries onion rings and occasionally burritos chimichangas 
beautiful but small this is another gorgeous piece by fiesta it is lovely and functional my only issue is that the dimensions state it is tall when it is really less than so beautiful but small 
good vacuum for the money very good suction fairly lightweight the cord is a bit short but my house is small so it isn t a big problem i added an extension cord to make it longer it can be a bit difficult to pull it along behind you you need to yank on it a little overall i m pleased with it s performance a few extra tools would have been nice like a smaller brush for carpeted stairs but i use the upholstery brush and that works pretty well on cat hair etc the big beater bar that comes with it does a very good job on cat hair as well 
darn good little vac i have had every kind of vacuum you can think of even a kerby i am embarrassed to say i have dogs and therefore a lot of hair and dirt the first time i used this vac i had just had my carpets cleaned the week prior and vacuumed the day before i was amazed appalled at the amount of hair and dirt one pass over my carpets made i too have a lot of tile and find it works well on hard surfaces as well for the price you can t beat this vac take this coming form what my ex once called a vacuum addict i love to vacuum if the noise bothers you pop in your ipod 
pretty and practical i absolutely love this trivet i use it on a daily basis to keep my tea piping hot the trivet is low and wide and balances a teapot just fine and its cast iron construction makes it sturdy enough to hold heavy dishes as well so dinner never gets cold to top it all off the design is very appealing and will only enhance the beauty of a well laid table i have the trivet in dune and my mother wants me to order one for her as well 
water cap solution i had this iron for over a year and i m pretty satisfied with it it s great for silk and other thin fabric it doesn t replace a regular iron i also had the water cap problem at first if you leave water in it the lid will expand and later the cap will fall out or will not screw on again the solution is to empty the tank after using it and let the tank and cap dry don t screw it on too tightly afterwards the lid might shrink afterwards and be hard to open again happened once i also drain the leftover water over the sink after using it it s a little bit of work but worth doing to prevent any further mess 
some tips from an owner i ve had this coffee maker for several weeks now so if you re considering it for your home or office please read on for some important tips i learned first hand that you may want to consider prior to your purchase first the drawbacks they are all surmountable as i will explain later this sucker is quite large and as mentioned in the other reviews the typical kitchen cabinet clearance means you will not be able to use the top burner unless you pull the unit out or keep it somewhere that is clear of overhead obstructions you must keep the reservoir filled with water to brew coffee depending upon how often you use the machine this means water will sit in the coffeemaker and may become stale between uses the machine takes minutes to warm up before it can brew that means if you want the coffee maker to be ready at all times you need to leave it on that means it s drawing electricity throughout the day you can brew no fewer than cups of coffee at a time or it will not displace water from the reservoir properly now to the strengths this machine brews a good hot cup of coffee go to any coffee shop or restarant and see what they use it s usually a bunn or other large size commercial maker that brews quickly and uses an incoming water line and drip filter basket that s basically what the waring is without the water line and it s much better built than the home use bunns i did a lot of research before buying this coffeemaker one of the best resources i found was a coffee issue of wine spectator that had all of the ins and outs of coffee including recommendations for coffee makers according to ws you need at least watts of power to get good extraction from the grinds the waring puts out so you ve got plenty of power the machine also brews quite fast an entire pot in approximately minutes here again this is another advantage of this machine to brew a good cup you want the hot water to come into contact with the grind long enough to extract flavor but not too long or it will also extract the bitter components of the coffee because of its fast brew time and high power output the waring is well up to the task the brew is hot with good flavor extraction and no bitterness or burned aftertaste still interested then first order the coffeemaker from costco online i picked mine up for i then went to the waring web site and downloaded a rebate form youll need to check if the rebate offer is still active the end result i got a coffeemaker for next purchase a gold filter basket i found one for about at my local wegman s you ll need one that fits an cup basket you can also order swiss gold coffee filters from sweet maria s that will fit the waring but they ll set you back about twice that third if you re worried about stale water turn it on and run full pots through it the machine displaces a portion of water equal to what you pour in so you can flush the entire coffeemaker this way remember it takes less than minutes to brew a whole pot so flushing the system will not take that long that said the water issue is the sole reason i withheld the th star fourth don t let the coffee pot sit on the warming burners ! as soon as your pot has brewed transfer the coffee to a preheated thermal carafe you can pick these up at a ross or marshall s for about if you leave the coffee on the heated burner it will burn the coffee ! this is especially true as you get down to that last cup in the pot get in the habit of using a carafe believe me this is one of the best things you can do to ensure your last cup is as good as the first in my opinion this makes the point about the upper burner moot you shouldn t use it anyway if you don t want to leave the machine on but don t want to wait minutes to brew every morning i ve got a simple solution for you buy an appliance timer just set it to turn the machine on when you wake up and off when you leave the house problem solved lastly if you usually brew less than cups and or do not want a big machine save yourself the expense and buy a french press they re a bit of a pain to clean but they do make the best tasting coffee in my opinion if on the other hand you want a workhorse machine for a great price read costco section that brews up a pot of coffee for guests parties in no time flat i recommend the waring pro 
big soft towels a great bargain when these towels arrived at my home i was surprised by how big and soft they were most kitchen towels i have had have been rather small and weren t very absorbent i was pleasantly surprised when i saw how nice these towels really are 
serves its purpose this humidifier works quite well is easy to operate and not bad to clean it comes apart easily enough and cleaning takes very little time we go through a tank full of water each day on the lowest setting unfortunately it is a little noisy so its turned off at night the noise isn t so noticeable during the day we re all breathing easier though so i m glad for the purchase 
super quality upscale design i have been looking for this kind of crystal items for a long time nothing i found with this quality and relatively low priced i would have spent for this if i had have seen this in the shops i am lucky that i happen searched in amazon exactly the classic design i have been looking for after item arrived i am impressed with the super quality the weight really heavy glasses plus simple designed silver plated tray just perfect ! this set is very tasteful classic elegant very upscale ! i recommend this was made in slovakia this is one of my few best purchases ! i can imagine to keep it for home forever i will never get tired of this set 
easiest ice cream ever i was a little worried about buying a reconditioned ice cream maker but when it arrived it was just like brand new including all original packing perfect i was also afraid that it would be too underpowered to freeze the sorbets and ice creams adequately but again it was quite strong in this regard and froze the mixtures perfectly admittedly doesn t make a huge amount but the convenience of not having to constantly add ice cubes and salt in the old wooden tub machine more than makes up for it and it s way quieter than the old fashioned freezers also it was half the price of a new one buy it ! 
great tumblers great price i am absolutely satisfied with my purchase the sets i ordered arrived in a timely manner the tumblers are top rack dishwasher safe too our drinks stay much colder much longer and even travel well in my suv cup holder these tumblers would also make a great present 
kitchenaid pro is a must have if you bake alot very powerful with heavy mixes and still remains quiet and undisturbing to the rest of the house even allowing easy non shouting conversations during get to gethers and home made pizza night the qt bowl will still mix small batches so don t think it s too big for everyday use red cayenne color is much more durable and appealing over the red the pictures don t do it justice and at amazon prices you really don t need to shop elsewhere trust me i wasted alot of time trying 
brita your water very satisfied with the system makes water tastes go away water should not have a taste at all and brita makes it that way 
beautiful set of spreaders i love this set i actually bought two and am glad i did beautiful packaging and rich deep colors of course they match all my service pieces would be nice as a gift too ! shipping seemed to be a bit slow but arrived in good condition and well packaged thanks 
a great buy i wanted a big frying pan for the dozen or so times a year i make a lot of potstickers latkes or even french toast we had something like this when i was a kid and it saw an awful lot of use surely i reasoned grandma would not have overpaid for a frying pan and i didn t want to either this pan has a nonstick surface which i initially thought would preclude getting a nice crispy finish i found that with an adequate amount of oil you get beautifully browned crisp edges its deep enough for frying chicken the controls are easy to read and use there is a totally coherent instruction booklet the pan is dishwasher safe the lid fits securely the plastic legs handles although reasonably sturdy are likely the weak spot but if they break the presto company sells replacements i plan to use mine whenever an extra large fry pan is called for this is a very nice item one s grandmother would not think is frivolous but instead very practical i recommend this simple and useful pan 
why didn t i get one of these earlier i just got my hoover floormate yesterday and i love it now i don t cringe when my son crawls on the kitchen floors and i don t live in fear of him getting e coli poisoning now to be realistic you can t expect it to do jobs that require elbow grease like caked on dirt but it sure makes daily cleanup and maintenance a breeze ! what i love is the fact that you don t need to drag out the vaccuum cleaner mop and bucket do the labor and then wait for the floor to dry or drag a bathtowel accross the floor it is incredibly easy to fill the unit take it apart and clean it and put it away also the older model is very reasonably priced and i don t think the newer model is worth the extra money for the features this unit does the job 
great combo product makes a good cup of coffee and the espresso machine part is easy to use and does a good job i really like the built in milk frother as long as you rinse it right away it is easy to clean and makes perfectly frothed milk everytime ! the feature allows you to make a half a pot of coffee that still tastes good 
love it it was a little tricky to put together by myself and the instructions could have been clearer but now it s done and i love my new sofa ! it s so much nicer than i expected to get for this price i highly recommend the matching tables too 
clean air my wife and i noticed the difference within a day of using it we felt better in the morning neither of us has been sick this winter after using it for several months and i was amazed at how much dust was on the pre filter when i replaced it for the first time i m so glad we bought it note as with all hepa filters it does make noise i recommend buying a large one and running it on low when you re sleeping in the room 
best buy for every day wine use i was impressed by this new arrival because of the brand name reidel and was looking for a glasss for drop in guests and summer cookouts and these four glasses fit the bill perfectly ! this way if i break one on my tile floor i won t burst into tears at the loss knowing i got a great deal on amazon com and if someone breaks one i ll order another for backup ! these will be great for lunches packing in a picnic basket for summer outings and simple but nice for casual entertaining 
luv it stars this is a doorway curtain not a window curtain the spaces between the strands is exactly as shown it s a dcor accent not a light blocking tool and i assure you the one i have in my closet door way makes my room feel tropically stylish luv it 
use for casseroles cakes or roasting le creuset manufactures porcelain enameled cast iron cooking vessels as well as other quality products these cooking vessels are cast from molten iron poured in sand moulds which are used only once for this reason one pan may look like another but each is unique in its own way cast iron is a highly efficient material which absorbs and distributes heat due to this efficiency it is recommended that cooking with cast iron is done on low to medium heat remove cast iron from the heat and it does not cool off quickly this helps your food stay warm while serving beware iron tends to be heavy so these cooking vessels tend to be heavier than other pans made from alternate materials cast iron is an effective material for cooking so why cover it with enamel iron tends to rust iron oxide rust doesn t add any complimentary flavors to your food if your cast iron cooking vessel was not enameled you would have to season and maintain its cooking surface adding the porcelain enamel not only looks good but has multiple benefits the enamel being a solid coating is one of the most hygienic surfaces to cook on does not stain absorb odors retain flavors and is easy to clean the enamel can be damaged so limit contact to wood or plastic utensils to eliminate the scratching and scoring the porcelain the benefits of cooking with le creuset cast iron are many but lets get down to the roasting pan specifically this pan holds quarts of food measures x inches internally and weighs pounds quarts is not a lot of space when it comes to casseroles so consider your recipes when determining the size you need this may be the pan for families from except for roasts the roasting pan tends to do best if at least full any less and you may overwhelm your food with heat evenly dispersed in the pot i find that the cast iron adds a crispy texture to food that may be desirable with a dish like mac ncheese while not so desirable for other dishes add the le creuset x inch roasting rack for roasting chickens and pork loins keeping them out of the grease some other possibilities for this pan include casseroles pork chops covered with cornbread dressing dinner rolls baked squash scalloped potatoes cobblers pineapple upside down cake or bread pudding the possibilities almost seem endless to your imagination one feature that people tend to complain about is the cost the cost does seem steep compared to other pans made from other materials heck cast iron doesn t seem like it should be expensive when comparing to that old cast iron pan past generations have used for cornbread and camping however the manufacturing process requires making a mould for each and every pan produced they then go through the enameling process before shipping these heavy pans if you take what goes into making and distributing these high quality cast iron products the cost tends to make sense then consider that this pan will easily last a lifetime when taken care of prosextremely versatileefficient absorption and distribution of heathygienic enamel cooking surfacedoes not stain absorb odors or retain flavorseasy to clean when not abused or misusedcan be transferred from stove top to the oven to the tablecan easily last a lifetimecons its heavy as cast iron tends to be weighing in at about pounds 
indispensible i ve been using this spatula for over a year and it has become indispensible it does a wonderful job getting those last bits of batter and sauce out of mixing bowsl and pans it s high temp silicone also makes it handy as a spatula for frying eggs and flipping pancakes it is easy to clean no removing the heads as is necessary with other silicon spatulas and is designed without seams that trap sauces and such i have thrown away my old rubber spatulas and plastic spatulas replaced them with variations of this handy kitchen tool 
a great dish for many uses im not much of a baker ok who are we kidding i dont bake however i have used the devil out of this dish i make hot appetizer dips in it i use it as a serving bowl i have filled it with water and floated flowers in it as a center piece i rabidly collect fiesta ware and recommend this as a great additional piece mine is sunflower yellow 
great saucepan excellent price i bought one as a wedding present and when i saw the quality i bought one for myself i love it 
good choice this is just the right size the quiet lid closing is a pleasure and the feature that allows you to fasten your trash bag saves frustration when heavy objects are put into the can glad i made this purchase ! 
does liquids well i ve only had mine for a little over a week but i ve already used it for chopping slicing and lots of pureeing the unit is sturdily built heavy and powerful just as others describe but i want to comment on liquid jobs if you are considering this unit for liquids don t be scared off by the negative reviews the shaft does indeed only rise halfway up in the bowl this allows the minibowl and blade to sit on top inside of the main bowl so you cannot fill the unit to the top with liquid and expect it to be completely leak freeon the other hand i ve made mayonnaise pureed for thin soup and made baba ganoush and i did not end up with liquid food all over the counter i had barely a leak and when i did it was because i was stil learning the position the blade had to be in for removal and so when it pulled off a little leaked through the bowl hole it is important to not fill liquids too high though this is true of any mixer processor imagine trying to mix cake batter with a spoon in a bowl that you had filled too high stuff will fly out ! the same is true of a processor however that does not reduce it to a cup capacity as someone claimed i made a thin pureed soup and got more than cups out of it the bowl hole is about halfway up so you won t get much more than that unless it s thick like my baba ganoush anyway use some common sense and this excellent product will treat you fine but if you need to be able to process or or more cups of thin liquid at a time you need to buy a larger unit than this one 
great sheets i was very pleased with these sheets in fact they are on my bed right now they do come out of the dryer a little wrinkled but once they are are the bed it does not afect the way they feel at all i love comfortable and that is the way these sheets feel to me i bought the queen size sheets and the fit was great i would happily purchase these again 
beautiful bia bia makes many dishes and bakeware items i have this oval baker as well as several others in this collection it is simple in design yet has flair about it the gentle waves around the tops of the cordon bleu wavy collection make it a beautiful piece to go from oven to table the handles make it easy to transfer from countertop to oven to table it has a nice weight to it bakes evenly and cleans up nicely i wish there were more pieces to this collection an elegant piece to bake in and set on the table 
great little whisk this is a fantastic little whisk it is perfect for whipping up hot chocolate or other drink mixes also to scramble eggs it is a must have in the kitchen for those little tasks that are too small for a big whisk 
working for over years i have had this unit for over years and everything still works just as good as the day i bought it i use it as my only stove almost daily as i live in a basement apartment the only problem i have with it is that it takes a while to heat to the point of boiling but once there it stays hot 
wonderful little dish with a million uses i bought this to use for brown bagging but have used it for so much more this little dish is great for storing leftovers or taking small portions to potlucks all without having to change the contents to a dressier dish french white is attractive enough to go with your best china and a much better value for the money 
best cup of coffee ever we got this just after christmas and it is absolutely the best cup of coffee that we have had since we were in italy i can t stand to drink drip coffee anymore there are several things to keep in mind for the best results use good filtered or spring water use a finely ground good coffee such as illy pack it just slightly in the filter don t try to rush it by turning the heat up too high never put it in the dish washer we have been using the organic espresso blend from whole foods and it is almost as good as the illy all in all this is easier and faster than most coffee makers and gives us a nice two servings of espresso in the morning add a little milk if you like but it s also great straight out of the pot 
its a cool gadget to have it worked just as i expected i like it and its very useful everytime i travel or read late at night which i often do it could be a bit brighter that it is but still no other problems battries also last a long time 
kind of big i love this plate and it s good for serving something like roast chicken but it s too big for everyday use so it sits in my cupboard the rest of the time just know that this plate is big ! if you do a lot of serving it s probably good for you but i only bring it out at thanksgiving holidays and large dinners with friends 
great product i bought this product cause i wanted something that was different and take up less space it works great and looks very updated in my kitchen i dont have to worry about more cords being plugged in on my counter its small and opens up my cans wonderfully i can get it started and walk off to do something really quick and it shuts off automatically when the can is opened it walks right around my can while it sits on my counter so dont have to worry about standing there and holding the can waiting for it to be finished i use my opener everday and have only had to plug it in once to recharge its battery and the lenght to recharge the battery was only about hours its a very good product and well worth the price im sure it wont let it down 
cute my son loves his new ducky shower curtain the ducks are large and fluffy the curtain does need a good ironing and the fabric is slightly thinner than i had anticipated however it is still a nice curtain 
best knives i loved my shun classic santoku knife so i purchased a piece set except my set came with a serrated bread knife instead of the utility knife shun is the best ! for the most control and best grip i was told to hold the knife close to the blade with my index finger on the metal ridge it seemed a little awkward at first but it s very comfortable once you get used to it ! i love the weight of the knives the wooden handles and the sharpness of the blades they do however need to be sharpened occasionally i judge this by how well they cut through a tomato i was told that you should use the boning steel every time you use a knife but i have never used it instead i ve been using the minosharp plus sharpener which sharpens the knives extremely well if i could only have one knife i d get the santoku not in this set because i use it far more often than any other knife however the large chef s knife is much better for cutting large hard foods like squashes and melons i love the multi functional scissors they come apart so you can sharpen them and clean them well and i like being able to protect my knives and keep them together in the wooden block 
easy to use this little factory is great the tube is easy to fill use squeeze and surprisingly it turned out better than any we have ever had this item is a 
luxurious is the only word i can think of to describe these towels i didn t think i could afford such high end towels fluffy soft absorbent large an unbelievable bargain wash them several times before using and don t use fabric softener it makes the towels waterproof 
handy and versatile i received this as a christmas gift i ve used it to carry wine to parties and even onto an airplane i had a tote large enough for this to fit into when it contained two bottles i found that it is just enough protection to keep the bottles fron clinking without adding extra weight when you re flying it s the best way i ve ever known for carrying wine bottles anywhere 
this knife can perform i bought this knife because i needed a boning knife to use in my meat science lab course this knife is amazing and it held up nicely despite the fact that i sharpened it weekly for several months and i used it to cut up a lot of different cuts of meat it is very flexible and it works really well at trimming fat and removing meat from bone another positive thing about the knife is the handle it is easy to clean it doesn t absorb moisture when you wash it and it is comfortable to hold i highly recommend this knife and at this price you definitely will not be dissapointed i paid more for it and i love my boning knife 
very stylish very sleek and stylish mirror compares favorably to mirrors selling for much higher prices 
cast iron wok being an amateur of cast iron cook ware i was delighted to find the cast iron wok offered by the wok shop to replace the wok stolen by the movers the wok shop provided fast and exempelary service in shipping the wok closely following their instructions on how to cure the wok i was delighted with its utility it proved to be lighter than my old cold steel wok and has a better distribution of heat my western cast iron now sits oiled and stored stored under the stove waiting for that rare occasion when the wok will not do and the price could not be beat 
swiss diamond c replacement cover i am very happy with the product it fits the fry pan perfectly 
bonjur primo latte i purchased this item as a gift for a friend she was visiting and i served her a cup of cappachino made with my bonjur she was so impressed that she wanted one also i use mine at least once a day it is so easy and i don t have to clean and work with a large machine to enjoy my latte and cappachino 
milano espresso to go i love the end product has the appearance and feel of a chair worth twice the price and was exactly what i wanted however the instructions for assembly leave certain steps to the imagination at one point in the assembly there were possible ways to go i guessed correctly and did not have to backtrack and take anything apart a bit of a frustrating experience to say the least is the frustration worth it without a doubt 
i love it this is by far my favorite pan i use it to cook everything in nothing sticks to it what so ever and i love the sleekness to it it s very durable and versatile you can use it for sauces noodle stir fry and everything else ! i would never buy a pan not made by t fal they re the best 
good design great waffles i am loving the aesthetics of this thing it reminds of the heavy duty no nonsense waffle makers at a waffle house the iron heats up quickly no more than five minutes from off to level the indicator lights are bright and the audible alert isn t loud or shrill any stainless steel case will get hot so if you are accident prone skip this unit and go with one with a plastic case i have to disagree with some of the complaints about the handle insulation this unit isn t a panini press and doesn t require you to grip it with your whole hand and yank up slight upward pressure with your thumb is all that s needed to disengage the lock free the waffle and open the lid and speaking of the locking mechanism it works perfectly on mine it is very subtle and does the job the plates are non stick and don t require oiling i have made dozens of waffles ranging in doneness from spongy to crispy and every single one has released cleanly again all it takes is a gentle upward pressure on the handle with your thumb until the lid opens one welcome surprise about this unit it is designed to be stored vertically ! the plate hinges and lip of the base make a tripod giving you more storage options my only issue with the waf r is that i think the gutters could be a bit bigger with a new batter that first waffle can get a little messy 
garlic roaster if you like garlic this is the quickest way to get warm fresh garlic to spread on french bread crackers or what ever you desire very fast just love the smell of roasting garlic very easy to clean also 
perfect grapefruit spoon it s a set of grapefruit spoons how can you mess that up the spoons are sturdy smooth and very comfortable in your hand 
works well and fast i have been using this instant read thermometer for the past couple of months and am impressed by the speed at which this tool registers the temperature of the different items that i am cooking it seems to be accurate as each meal that i have used this for has been cooked correctly i have used this for chicken beef pork and other assorted dishes the thermometer appears to be extremely sensitive as moving the tip to different parts of the meat can give significantly different readings so a word of caution about making sure that you are inserting the probe into the proper location in the past few years i have used several instant read thermometers both digital and non digital and this is the best one of the four or five i have tried 
not the one alton brown recommends previous reviewers are attaching alton brown s recommendation to this item but unfortunately if you go to his web site you will learn differntly httpwwwaltonbrowncompageselementshtml click on the pt box 
if i could only own one pot pan i love this pot pandutch oven it can do everything ! bakes fantastic crusty bread sautees vegetables for a cassarole and then goes into the oven to bake almost a one pot meal ! the enamel has such a pleasing feel to it it cleans easily even baked on food it is so versatile it has inspired my cooking i am so excited for a host of winter stews etc in short a sturdy and heavy versatile aesthetically pleasing cooking vessel plus you don t have to worry about all those non stick surfaces poisoning you or what have you 
exactly what i ordered wanted a stylish utensil holder to match the black accents in our new kitchen and it was perfect 
excellent stockpot bought this stockpot to replace a faberware millenium one this stockpot is by far much better quality than faberwaremillenium model was when new i would buy more swiss diamond pieces as needed 
excellent tool for careful cooks i use this tool every day i have never cut myself with it nor have i had any trouble with food catching on the blades like any cutting tool it requires careful use used properly however it is a wonderful simple tool i use it to cut cabbage fennel and carrots for salads ginger for stir fries apples for garnish etc 
lasts as long as advertised i have one cat and get about to weeks out of a cartridge before it needs to be replaced it does a very good job at odor control as well i would say the only downside is that they are a little pricey 
villa della luna soup cereal bowls beautiful ! the size of these bowls are so that they can also be used for serving bowls too the colors are beautiful and the quality is wonderful 
year warranty how bout years yep the vintage original from college is still kickin of course there are now others for the lake house a couple for camping the cars etc who knows how many i ve given as gifts over the years happy in the knowledge that they ll replace whatever cheap junk the recipient now uses and last forever doing their job one of the most durable high performance purchases ever 
works really well i bought this to replace an old honeywell heppa air purifier since we were use to the white noise of the old one we wanted one we could hear if you put this one on the lowest setting it s just right noise wise the nd and rd settings we find way too loud it cleans the air well i only gave it stars instead of because the light around the control is extremely bright i had to paint around it to black it out and it still shines through some 
excellent i love my new salad bowl set the color is beautiful so is the quality and you can t beat the price 
finally a good dispenser i ve tried so many syrup dispensers all of which dripped and often the flow mechanism would get stuck this one is the first which has neither problem it looks quite nice too wish it were a little bigger 
now i can rest cooking breakfast for can get hectic but with the cool touch grill my year old grandaughter enjoys making the pancakes and french toast of course she has supervision but we can make many items at once making my mornings easier when my children are home to visit 
average just got this washed ok no color run the towel has a price tag of on it i paid would be a good buy for very average have towels for bucks same size etc 
powerful this blender is very powerful the lid is a little difficult to take off only a minor issue with me 
a chef in the making this kit is very durable and my daughter loves it the hat is velcro and can be sized appropriately the fabric is thick enough for good durability and washing 
we love this coffee maker after trying a different delonghi model and not being pleased the thermal pot did not keep the coffee warm and it spilled coffee on the counters while brewing we tried this model at my sister inlaws request she purchased this model about months ago and we love it ! the coffee stays hot and is easy to use my husband and i would recommend this model to everyone 
chocolate fountain i gave this chocolate fountain as a gift to my grandchildren and they loved it however we found out that it needed quite a lot of chocolate a lot more than we anticipated thus it can t be used as much as we would ve wanted to 
scissor set only ok this scissor set is not as sturdy as i was expecting from a henckels product the all purpose scissors work well but the pruning shears are very light weight and the open close mechanism is very cheap i dont htink they will last too long probably why they were less expnsive for same set in other mags 
sturdy these cups are larger than they appear ! and very strong and sturdy a thick ceramic i use them every day to microwave eggs etc 
great product incredible packaging please read the review i just sent for the turquoise set i am thrilled about the packaging and so happy that you didn t use styrofoam if it was sent by the vendor please contact them and give them an atta boy i m happy about everything i recieved fiesta ware is wonderful i wish i d ordered cobalt or purple oh well my problem not yours please spread the word out to your vendors that eco packaging is cheaper and uses less oil thank you daryl bergman and mother earth dary 
popsicle molds i purchased this ice pop maker popsicle mold for my five and seven year old great grandchildren i love the molds for the convenience they love the popsicles and i use soy milk because of milk intolerance in one and juice with added calcium and vitamin d for the other child that will not drink milk this is an fun way to get better nutrients into them as they enjoy their treats thanks jo 
the best i have been cooking on cast iron cookware for about years it is what i was taught to cook on my great aunt and mom used only cast iron i have about different pieces most were handed down from them it is the longest lasting of any cook ware made once it is seasoned i never wash with soap just plain steel wool and hot water the into the oven set on degrees to dry and season more ! it is the best 
great cover and very inexpensive i gave this to my daughter because her down comforter was now featherless from age the feathers came out also she is a vegetarian and wants alternative the old one we always covered with a special cover made for that but this one was so pretty that she just leaves it as a comforter blanket also she s lazy 
beautiful and elegant but handle with care i love these glasses for white wine and they set off iced tea perfectly the down side is that you have to hand wash them and they are prone to breaking but this is a terrific price for a beautiful set of wine glasses 
awesome ! my eldery parents loved it my mother laughed so hard beaming with elation on how wonderful and ingenious the touchless trashcan was quotit is so beautiful honey now i don t have to worry about trying to open the lid when my hands are full especially when i m cooking quot 
delicate but very nice we have had these glasses for a while now and are very pleased with them true they are very delicate but they are made from borosilicate glass which is quite sturdy we clean them in the dishwasher and have not had any problems with that although you should make sure they don t touch other glass or metal in the dishwasher these wine glasses have quickly become our favourites 
feliway diffuser i have used this product for several years in a multi cat household with excellent results it has proven to be very helpful with the stress anxiety of introducing a new member to our crew and helps maintain happy housemates 
very nice and comfy sheets my partner and i both really like these sheets they are thick soft smooth and cozy 
it s ingenious as a humidifer it s of course bogus to point out the german social system as reason for the price a free market is characterized by supply and demand setting the price i asssume there is a free market in the u s what you effectively pay for in this humdifier is the idea and patent not the material it s the same why an armani suite costs and why microsoft office costs more than the cd it is burned on i have this humidifier now for a year i am an allergy sufferer and dry air makes it worse i live in ca thye humidifier extends on the principle of what my mom always recommended put a bowl with water in your room since it does not heat the air you don t have problems with overheated air that then condenses on windows etc the dryer the air the more it will pick up the humidity it s kind of self regulating it does the job for me i measure it and i get usually a jump from to of humidity in my room i personally think cleaning is very easy you have to use their cleaner i do it every weeks or so it s true there will be mineral deposits on the air cleaner i wipe them away every months it s not a problem as you can dissassemble this thing completely i think this is the best humdifier out there it avoids all the problems of heated humdifiers and it s self regulation is ingenious i don t believe it does a good job of cleaning the air however that s why i have friedrich b as well btw speaking of which it costs and is a set of metal plates with a fan made in the u s 
love it cleaning a drawback but not a huge one i ve had mine for about years and just love it it s a perfect size for a single person or snack size for teens clean up can be a pain if you let the unit cool first i recommend wringing out a warm wet sponge over the unit immediately after the food is removed that will loosen all the worst of the mess use the plastic scraper thingie its a technical term really ! to do a quick clean of the worst parts after you eat and it cools it will be easier to clean then 
hey jerx it works to be honest i haven t used it all that much it gives off a fair amount of light though sort of like a miniature street lamp usually if my wife gets up in the middle of the night to pee she s pregnant so she gets up in the middle of the night to pee a lot and i happen to be awake i ll roll over and grab the mighty bright and guide her way into the bathroom with it it s pretty good for that don t get me wrong it s good for reading too i just haven t done much reading lately maybe i ve given up 
does fit my classic revere ware i bought this for my two classic revere ware qt pots marked clinton ill and steamer attachment and this piece fits fine on all three pieces all of today s revere ware including this lid are made overseas the pots now seem to be made of a much thinner gauge of steel but this glass lid works fine 
lovely i have a white stove with black burners that are such an eyesore when i want my kitchen to look and i am so pleased with these burner covers they are just the right touch to keep my kitchen looking bright and clean 
a superior set this is hands down the best set of knives i have ever owned this is my second set of henckel knives the first having walked out of my house one afternoon nearly any new knife will seem very sharp the real question is how long will they keep an edge these knives retain their sharpness quite well the carbon steel used is quite good and utterly smooth the body of the blade is the appropriate thickness for the task that is some are thinner and more flexible like the boning knife while others are thicker and more solid like the chef s knife of course you will need to sharpen knives periodically i recommend sending them to a professional knife sharpener or if you are so inclined and skilled use a specially designed kitchen knife sharpening jig remember dull knives are more dangerous than sharp ones because you use more force and thus are more likely to slip a chef s knife is sharp enough when it can cut well into meat by simply drawing it across using only the weight of the knife it should not catch the cutting a sheet of paper trick is just that a trick and not a good indicator of sharpness while the set does include a sharpening bar i find these require some skill and practice in order to get a both good edge and keep your own blood inside your body all knives including the steak knives have a wonderful balance and handle shape i have had no trouble with my hand slipping onto the blade i have medium sized hands and fit well i also find the handle design to be handsome the variety of knives in this set is good something for nearly every task i particularly like the large chef s knife and extra small paring knife the steak knives are nice in that the upper half and tip have small serrations while the lower half is a smooth blade i like the fact that you get both long and short serrated bread knives the video that came with my set was well done and quite helpful like any knife set for long life you should not put these in the dishwasher it is not that the knives cannot somehow tolerate being immersed in hot water no rather it is simply impossible to prevent something else from hitting blades that would result in premature wear and harm the actual razor thin cutting edge but then this caution applies to all knives so this is not really a limitation of this set though you may be tempted you should not try to chop firewood with these knives as this will lead to premature wear 
stylish i just got into wine a little while ago and wanted some nice glasses to sip from at home rather than just using a plastic or glass tumbler but seeing as how i m anywhere near wine snob status i didn t want to spend a bunch on a set enter the riedel o glasses they were on sale great price for two glasses they arrived and i m happy with them they re sophisticated enough to be wine glasses but without the stems they re not snobby either i would have given this stars but one of the glasses i received has a minor imperfection along the rim almost a little bubble of glass or crystal other than that they re great 
cotton sheet set this item was received almost the day i ordered it i love these sheets now i don t even want to use the other set i have these are so soft and cozy a seller and a quality of item received buy this item if you are just thinking about it you won t be disappointed 
the cooling fan my sister recently bought of these fans and i had to get also because i really liked them and of course i like having the remote control the fans work great for me 
great purchase i was extremely pleased wth the lenox holiday piece set purchase ! it was definitely a great buy in that i did some comparative shopping and found the amazon price to be the least expensive the set looks elegant and will certainly add to the holiday table 
love that cart these carts and shelving units are the best i ve ever seen they are flexible in shelf height a minimum of one inch between and it is very easy to reposition shelves after months of use i have several shelf units and two carts and i plan on purchasing more for those of you unfamiliar not a better purchase can be made some units even come with wheels for even more flexibility 
polder deluxe bread bin very nice bread bin ! i was pleasantly surprised that the stainless steel bread bin matched my cuisinart items coffee maker toaster oven perfectly the finish is a brushed stainless rather than shiny stainless it looks very nice on my counter top much nicer than the old bread basket with bread hanging out everywhere it s also very roomy i also like the cutting board as i m forever digging under my kitchen cabits for a cutting board ! 
lip comes in very handy this is a wonderfully crafted stylish with simple lines lazy susan i use it mainly for condiments and spices besides the stove but also on the table for the little bowls with sauces and supplements that go with fondue mexican or east indian dishes in that case i appreciate the lip which holds things back from sliding all over the table especially when eating with kids or spirited guests in general a lazy susan is not meant to get in contact with food directly improvise with the glass tray from your microwave it s easy to clean and in a fridge or kitchen cabinet corner your susan needs a lip otherwise small things disappear forever 
wilton cake pan wilton makes the best products for any baker ! i only use wilton when it comes to making decorative cakes for my friends and family this cake pan makes the perfect half sheet cake 
good espresso had the machine for month now will be back in months to rate any reliability aspects it makes great espresso all crema works equally well with pods and powder coffee powder container has a locking feature to help dispose of used powder without loosing the powder cup water container needs to go under pump hose so attention needed when placing it on the machine not bad though temperature meter works well i have not tried cappucino drinks but looks straightforward this machine is beautiful form and function all the way 
fryer rocks we purchased this fryer a few weeks ago and have used it over times we love it the only downside is the viewing window isn t really functional unless you want to hold a flashlight in one hand many many positives which include easy to clean easy to use easy to drain oil well built compact safe this size works great ! we love it 
eclipse filtration illumination system really like this system easy to change charcoal filter and easy to pull and clean bio wheel never had an aquarium stay so clear so long only drawback and it s a slight one is illumination is on front panel that means if you re short like me the light is off during water exchange otherwise you could go through rear panel 
quick shipping shipping was quick the product was great it was a gift for my sister and she loved it 
yum yum i had purchased an ice cream maker some years ago and was disappointed in the quality of the plastic parts on the machine in fact the lid broke after only uses this model has very sturdy plastic parts that are easy to clean and with proper care i anticipate will last a lifetime be sure to completely dry the freezer bowl after using and then pop it right back into the freezer wrapped in an airtight plastic bag that way you ll have the bowl ready for those times you just have to have ice cream i ve made many lower fat versions using skim milk and fat free half and half and my family loves it 
toastylicious as much as a toaster can this one makes me happy it toasts evenly and seems to be very well made in a tres cute sturdyclassy way the crumb tray is very convenient and i think the slanted top of the toaster makes it even easier to get the toast out this toaster toasts slower than some of the other models that i ve tried but i think it s worth the minimal extra wait the amazon price is decent too especially if you purchase it with other items so that you get the off and of course who doesn t love free shipping 
yummy toast and looks great too this toaster makes the best toast of any toaster i have ever owned and it looks great ! i tossed my blue plastic cuisinart which at best made mediocre toast and had that icky plastic worn out look this toaster is metal sturdy and has a great retro look in today s colors mine is red i also bought the matching coffeemaker and the drink mixer a quick and cheap way to update the kitchen amazon service has been great and with the off i got some great buys 
love this this is the perfect little pitcher to own for serving creamer or milk for coffee or tea it s a wonderful compliment to the rest of the fiestaware line of serving items not only for everyday use but also for parties however i do recommend that you order more than one if you do plan on using them for many people mix and match the colors for a beautiful table setting 
great for back or side sleepers i ve owned two of these pillows although the first one got flatter before as many years as it said it should last for me they ve been the best pillows i ve had i have problems with my neck head etc with normal pillows they are just too high my old simmon s beautyrest pillow is being used by a family member and two other family members also have this kind of pillow ! they are apparently fine for side sleepers as well ! i would definitely recommend them for people who have trouble with other types of pillows 
very nice solid roasting rack this rack is very nice and heavy duty i cooked an lb turkey on it with ease the non stick coating seems durable enough for the purpose and the rack is plenty large and heavy enough the only reason i am giving it four instead of five stars is that the piece could have easily been made even sturdier by using a few more welds there are a number of points on the rack where the metal rods simply touch one another and are not welded while the rack held my lb turkey with no problems it seems to me that two or three more spot welds by the manufacturer would greatly increase the durability of the item that being said it is the sturdiest rack i have found so far 
wonderful the product does what it is suppose to do you can not go wrong with kitchen aide products 
great product using this product for about months now and it s simply great this unit received a lot of use during the holidays and it never missed a beat i ve read a few reviews here and they seem either fake or the folks didn t understand how to operate it and should probably go back to a fry daddy for simplicity the euro does require that you get the unit set in the rails to trip the safety switch and you do need to keep this thing clean i change the oil about every months depending on how much protein i fry nice to be able to put the tub in the dishwasher and looks like new upon reassembling the major difference between this unit and several others i ve owned is the larger capacity liters capacity is very important in keeping the oil to temperature and keeping the food less greasy in addition to the capacity the wattage is upped to watts which is above par for consumer level fryers this is one of the largest capacity home fryers around at this price fried zucchini and mushrooms are simply restaraunt quality ! i also recommend experimenting with batters search the net for this ie use italian dry mix in flour for a kfc type fried chicken good stuff 
off to good start a few years ago i tried stir frying and liked it except that i used a joyce chen nonstick wok that peeled after two uses after that i got a lodge cast iron wok that was way too heavy and got discouraged and gave it away then i tried i a no name carbon steel wok but was very ignorant about how to season it and could not understand why it kept rusting recently i have had the urge to try stir frying again and this time did my homework i chose this wok because it was carbon steel and this time learned ahead of time how to season it properly this wok is also very sturdily made you cannot easily bend the wok if you push on it the handles are not loose it is mm thick it has phenolic plastic handles that stay cool i have properly seasoned and been using the wok with no rust or stickiness learning how to season and clean made all the difference a good education and a well made wok are an unbeatable combination ! see some of ther other wok posts for good seasoning tips i followed the directions that came with the wok and had good results 
works great compared to other siphons i like this one because of the pump the material it is made of is not the most durable when compared to the other siphons since i only use it every other week i don t think that durabilty will be an issue i saw this item at some of the big chain stores for a much cheaper price 
great piece for the money gets lots of compliments i was a little skeptical about ordering a piece of furniture online would it arrive scuffed up or broken but i was very glad i took the risk with the console table i had seen it long ago in a target store but they have since stopped selling it in stores it was as nice as i remembered it being when i saw it in person other than a very minor flaw in the finish on the top of the table which i don t think was an issue with shipping or handling it arrived in perfect condition everyone who has been to my house since i bought it has commented on what a great piece of furniture it is one thing to note the drawers are very shallow so don t expect for them to hold bulky items like remote controls 
a little beauty what a lovely pan heavy without needing daily gym visits to manage lifting and a great non stick surface just about the right size for or people if i found the for the same price i d buy one of those for bigger jobs 
multi small pet friendly i love the catit fountain i have cats and a rabbit and they can all drink out of it at the same time the bunny and young cat prefer the dome and my older cat prefers the bowl part so there is abundant harmony at the water bowl it is very easy to clean i do it about once a week in the dishwasher much quieter than the drinkwell and comes when i got it with a hard cord cover making it particularly bunny friendly 
the dtc is the best coffee maker we ever owned read this if you are a serious coffee drinker like us ! we have been buying using and tossing out coffee makers for the past years we have used every type known percolaters presses melita gravity cones and etc this coffee maker is the best ! this cuisinart is a cinch to use and the coffee tastes great this is my second one the first one is still cranking out good coffee after over five years of daily use we purchased the new cuisinart so that we could put the old cuisinart on our motorhome permanently for use whenever we travel the thermal carafe keeps the coffee hot and tasty for hours the carafe is rugged stainless steel in and out i thought that it may not keep the coffee hot long enough because of the thermal transmission of steel vs glass our old one has a glass vacuum bottle inside not so ! it works great we always pre heat by rinsing the carafe with a little hot water before we start some people commented that the carafe lid is difficult to screw on this takes a little gentle technique development after about two patient attemps it becomes second nature we run a little warm water over the lid that helps the threads to slip into place be sure to turn the lid until it stops at its limit its easy the gravity actuated ball check valve in the lid is ingenious it automatically closes when you stop pouring and set the carafe down when you want to pour you just tilt the carafe gravity works on the ball check the valve opens instantly and automatically how clever is that nothing to twist no clumsy levers to push as in the abominable mr coffee thermal unit the cuisinart simply works great regarding one reviewer s comment about the possibility of overflow the subsequent mess and bail valve clogging with grounds i experienced this only once i think the cause was that i overfilled the bail with too much coffee i used a very heavy paper filter i had ground the coffee too finely in our home grinder as a result of all three factors the coffee could not drip through as fast as the boiler was feeding hot water into the bail nuff said controls are simple the front control and viewing screen location is more convenient than our old one which has a side mounted switch the clock is a handy feature but we have never used the pre setting timer the water fill measuring tube works perfectly we use reverse osmosis purified water so we do not need to clean the unit very often and of course the coffee tastes better the black color with the stainless carafe and trim is a handsome combination however more importantly the carafe lid does not show coffee colored staining over time as the white colored unit does i recommend this coffeemaker to everyone who loves good coffee ! 
space effecient i really like this appliance it does a good job toasting my bread and microwaving my food if necessary the baking item does okay but i haven t mastered the amount of time to bake something i would own it again it s nice to have my toaster and microwave as one unit to save space in my kitchen 
cuisinart cookware i had been looking for stainless steel and pricing all the name brands amazon had this with free shipping and i decided it was worth a try my daughter in law has capholon stainless and it looks just like my cuisinart set i really like my cookware and would recommend it i use it everyday it s pretty and functional it evenly heats and browns the food i also like the fact i have pieces i intend to add other pieces p

feather down comforter warm as toast got one for myself and one for my son with no high expectations i wanted to get away from electric blankets without adding weight this did that job superbly light as the feathers within it warms up fast and i sleep marvelously in the comforter cocoon wish i d bought it years ago 
powerful quiet i purchased this pump because it needs to be able to supply a lot of air through about ft of tubing the first ft of that being straight up this pump works wonderfully ! not only does it pump enough air to run a in bubble disk and a in bubble wand but it does so with so much power that i actually have my splitter set to only power and as amazing as it may seem it does all this silently ! i ve used the big blue rounded pumps before and they are silent for a while but then get unbearably loud i ve been running this pump non stop for months and it hasn t increased in sound level at all it s truly amazing i have no problem recommending this pump to everyone it s cheap for what it offers and it offers a lot 
nice and big years ago i bought a potato cutter at a garage sale it was all steel and a good size accepting virtually any potato without cutting it down to size i ve been very happy with it recently we bought a cabin so needed to add a second set of kitchen tools one of the items we decided we wanted was a second potato cutter i ordered this one because of the jumbo in the name hoping that it would work as well as our previous garage sale cutter thankfully this product lives up to the jumbo name it s larger than our garage sale cutter by or so it is easy to use and clean up not to mention it has a suction cup to attach it to the counter which works surprisingly well pros large with two sizes of cutting blades a larger mesh for traditional fries and smaller mesh for mcdonald like fries cons it s plastic and steel which makes me wonder about longevity allinall i think this was a good purchase updatemy wife loves this vegetable cutter and has asked me to order another ! she has used ours at least twice a week since we recieved it in aug and has had no difficulties with it at all i m surprised to see that another purchaser has had problems with this product perhaps they received a defective one at any rate i would still recommend the product 
my first real dishes for my nd apartment i decided to get real dishes instead of the hodge podge i had from dorms and thrift stores i could not be happier w these dishes the price was reasonable and they are incredibly durable i really like the plum its a rich purple and it was easy to match it to other fiestaware i liked the color so much i got the mugs and other kinds of bowls to match the dishes it was a great deal and it will be easy to add to my kitchen set 
dyson dusting brush a great purchase ! i use it on just about everything forget the pledge it just moves the dust around the dyson eliminates it ! hello to a dust free home 
zojirushi thermal carafe i just recently received this carafe and am very pleased with it so far it has kept our coffee piping hot for over hours i love the design and the swivel base we have used the glass lined plastic carafes in the past and they just don t keep the coffee very hot the zojirushi thermal carafe is well worth the price excellent product 
fantastic piece of kit actually i bought this machine in england same model in black and silver i tried out various machines while trying to find a good machine for not too much money i love coffee don t get me wrong but i aint daft enough to pay big bucks when theres really no need i tried breville pure trash i tried gaggia very good but expensive but this machine comes a very close second to the gaggias suprisingly ive had my machine for months now and had a slight problem with the handles plastic teats where the coffee comes out of i called krups and they replaced it immediatley no problems star customer service and that is saying something considering i m in peru what can i say every time without fail fantastic expresso and lattes if you want more gadgets go for the model but to be honest for the price this is your best buy they say you pay for what you get not true with this machine you get a lot more good quality well made and if you should need it good customer service the only down side to this machine is it does have a loud pump but that just makes you feel you are in a coffee shop worth it buy it 
everything i was looking for ok let me start by saying i am not a coffee snob i am more of a coffee nut i very much prefer a cup of my nice dark italian roast but if the neighbor offers me a cup of his foldgers i wont turn up my nose and for a guy like me this machine is perfect i looked at the dollar machines but just couldnt see spending that for something i see myself using days out of the week so i setteled on this machine and i have not one regret i have had the machine about weeks now i admit i dont use it every day as i have thoses mornings where i am just running late and dont have time but in that three weeks i have used it at least days out of every week and it has been great this thing is so easy to use right out of the box with the pods i was just amased my old machine went down quite a while ago so i havent pulled a shot in a very long time and with this machine i was sipping a great one in minutes the one thing that did dissapoint me is the pods i bought the machine thinking i would use them as they seemed so convient and dont get me wrong the illy dark roast pods make one of the best shots of espresso i have ever had very quickly but keep in mind they only make one shot at a time so for me who usually likes or shots in a cappucino they are a bit time consuming and i have found it better to just pack my own double shots but besides that little thing this machine is perfect for a coffee nut like me it does a great job no matter what im in the mood for be it a straight shot a cappucino or the nice mocha latte every now and then this is a great machine for you may not be good enough for a coffee snob but just right for a coffee nut oh and one hint i found very helpfull turn the machine on or minutes before you are going to use it the longer the better with your cups up on the warmer i saw some people complaining that the espresso was only luke warm when it came out i exprenced the same problem when i dont let it warm up and brew into a cold cup but if you do let it warm up it will make you a nice piping hot espresso !

good lamp a little heavy i ve been using the lamp most nights for the past two weeks the light is very good covers both pages if one positiions it well and the batteries are still going strong there is a little light spillage but not so much that it bothers my mate the clip grabs the book cover well works for both paperbacks hardcovers an ounce or so lighter would be nice but it s not really very heavy 
fully taste the great wine you paid for if you re going to spend money on good wine don t put it in cheap glassware you ll be throwing your money away ! what a reviewer below referred to as the oddugly angular bend is exactly what enables these glasses to bring out the full flavor of the wine do you just want your table to look pretty or do you want the food and drink to taste fabulous if you want the latter shove aside some of those martha stewart table decorations to make room for these glasses and enhance your fine wines

duck with cherries rabbit with kasha anyone in addition to all the beautiful words said about le creuset i want to add several things that i haven t seen anywhere else first the oval shape in a pot this size is preferable because it s easier to lift you hold the pot closer to your body also it fits better in the oven a pound duck fits perfectly in quarter oval pot with just enough room left to place some cherries or oranges around second le creuset became some sort of a cult i saw a couple of large french ovens on emeril s show the other day and if you are into french cajun or just any rich cooking you just have to have at least one third the price seems to be high but then i saw some fifty year old le creuset ovens being sold at the auction for at list of what they would cost new now think of it as an investment forth about the colors i was disappointed in the beginning to find out that they only sell this size in white or french blue but when i received my blue oval oven i loved the color the picture in the catalog doesn t do it justice this large pot in red my initial choice would have looked like a fire truck i since added a couple more blue pieces and for those who are interested in starting their tableware collection this color coordinates beautifully with the denby reflex pattern 
bunn best ever i don t normally review a item after owning it just over a week but today i decided i should review the bunn bx like i said i have only owned it just over a week no problems setting it up just follow the instructions it has made good coffee from day one i love getting it ready to brew and then going out to get the paper it s ready before i can get out the door with my old brewer i still was waiting after i started reading the paper this morning put the icing on the cake for me i had just put coffee in the basket when the electric went out i thought no coffee there was a cup left from yesterday maybe i could heat it in the microwave but could not even do that then it hit me there was heated water in the tank all i need to do was pour the cold water in to push that hot water out so five minutes into a power outage i was brewing a nice hot star cup of coffee i would think one could brew coffee even a half hour into a power outage the only down side to the bunn is that it is not a cup but i can put up with that after this morning 
awesume confetti color my daugter moved into her bedroom home recently and loves her small powder room downstairs right off the living room she decided to go bold with black and white stripes wallpaper and a bright pink flowers border at the top i searched and searched for the right color of bright pink finally found these confetti pink towels i was not disappointed when they arrived more important neither was she awesume color and great quality thanks for such a product 
dog groomer effective at removing undercoat until we bought this tool we never had an effective comb that would remove our dogs undercoat it has helped to reduce the amount of dog hair we clean up especially in the spring when out dog begins to shed 
cast iron inch wok this is exactly does what it says no fancy gourmet designs after seasoning will last a lifetime with proper care 
i waited too long to buy this this immersion blender is so easy to use ! i can t believe i lived without it i have spent plus years using mixers and blenders that don t do half the job this immersion blender does it is especially great for pureeing hot soups i used to do this with my regular blender and blew the top off now i have no problem with hot or cold items this item also works well to make dips smooth mashed potatoes or smoothies it is also easy to clean up 
excellent little heater though not a large heater it heats up a room as good or better than the space heater i use more than twice as big the one touch button operation takes a little time to get used to but all in all i consider this to be an excellent little heater 
good knife i like this knife it is very sharp and cuts thru vegetables easily i find that the inch blade is too short for some slicing jobs such as cutting large onions or potatoes but still gets the job done

very good i have both the black decker pks powered kitchen scrubber and the other version that is not by black decker i m referring to ultimate scrubber i find b d scrubber much stronger and better then the ultimate scrubber pros works great strong cons takes aa batteries that die out pretty quick does not come with all the attachment it has and the attachments are hard to find 
thanks for the bulbs since these might bright replacement bulbs are very difficult to find in the stores now i was so glad to have found them here now i know where i can find them in the future thanks for stocking them 
great mixer for the price very nice unit i ve wanted to get one of these for a long time but just didn t get around to it at the price i paid this was a no brainer it would be nice if it came with the funnel attachment for pouring ingredients into the bowl 
very practical these may not be a cute as the tabletop salt and pepper shakers the smaller round ones but let me tell you that having the handles makes a world of difference when it comes to cooking you know the moment that i am talking about your hands are covered in whatever you are making flour butter chicken juice ect or they are already pre occupied by the spoon oven mitt pot or pan you might be tending to but you still need a little more salt what do you do you grab the handle thats what it s there for and you need not worry about it slipping out of your hands and onto the floor or into your food 
crafter s creative helper this neat little organizer plus its coordinating friends has turned my collection of beading supplies scrapbooking supplies paints glues and assorted treasures from scary to streamlined and almost doubled the amount of stuff i can fit in the closet allocated for my projects the items are easy to build units can be attached with dowels and are made to accommodate oversized craft supplies

great product this product worked as well as expected and the vendor was easy to deal with the product shipped on time 
best purchase ever this vacuum has exceeded my hopes and all at a great price ! 
very handy it s funny the different experiences people have with the same products now this review is for the blender express not the plus the only difference is the attachments my wife picked up a couple of these at wally world after christmas they were in a clearance cart for bucks each i figured that they were probably pretty cheap and i d have a backup after i burned the first one up well a little over a year later i m still using the first one i use it times a week for smoothies and frozen coffee drinks i have to say that i really abuse the little guy my coffee drinks call for half of the mug to be filled with crushed ice it will make these drinks with a minimum of crunchy ice particles and they are quite enjoyable i never expected it to last this long because truthfully from day one i have been able to notice the burned wire odor coming from the unit as i continuosly overload the mug yet it is still chugging along even at the full price a year of this type of useage certainly makes it a good value and cleanup is extremely easy and the make it and run mug is really handy of course for larger quantities i fall back on the larger blender if i ever do wear out both of these units i would not hesitate to purchase another 
a point of clarification so that other readers are not mislead a tea pot is designed to hold hot water and tea leaves so as to steep the tea a tea kettle is designed to hold water to be heated preferably on the stove top i do not recommend using a microwave to heat water as that method of heating invariably seems to alter the flavor of the water at least if you are serious about your tea 
cuisinart s chef s classic series is a best value we have owned varies types of cookware in the past years some we have had to throw away some were passed down to the kids however this is by far the best cookware we have every owned i never buy anything with first researching the product i spent hours comparing the various brands of stainless steel cookware based on the various styles of cooking we do you name the brand and i more then likely looked at it the chef s classic series is every bit as good as the some of the more expensive brands on the market today it transfers and holds the heat very well it cooks at a fraction of the temperature of lesser quality cookwares the handles are comfortable in your hand even filled they do not feel over whelming heavy but at the same time they have a solid sturdy feel they feel balanced ! clean up was always a problem with the other stainless steel cookware we owned but not with these i m actually surprised how easily food releases with only minimal oil i do not think you would be disappointed if you choose this cookware 
good size occasional hot spot i ordered this crock pot to replace an older version that didn t have a removable crock what i like about it crock is removable and dishwasher safe size is perfect for person meals doesn t take up much storage space glass lid allows you to see the contents my concerns seems to have a hot spot on one side but it s only an issue if i leave the dish cooking longer than i should such as if i get home from work really late the lid doesn t look like it fits well however i don t think i m losing any heat so it might just be an aesthetic issue i have used this crock pot times in the past month and am very happy with it so far the hotspot issue has affected two meals and i was able to just cut off the overcooked part but that s the reason i gave this stars instead of a general warning to anyone who is not familiar with crock pot cooking the days of putting a dish in the crock pot before you leave for work and it being perfectly done when you return home are over in my opinion the new slow cookers crock pots cook much faster and hotter than those our mothers owned in the s my large quart rival crock pot actually boils when i turn it on high ! i suggest you experiment with yours on a weekend before you go off and leave it cooking unattended while you are at work for or hours i find that if a crock pot recipe calls for cooking on low for hours it only takes hours in my small or large crock pots if you enjoy good oatmeal try the oatmeal recipe in the instruction manual i ate the instant microwave oatmeal for years but have now become hooked on the real oatmeal we make overnight in the crock pot 
great machine but buy it reconditioned i ve had my eye on this for a long time but couldn t justify over one and half thousand dollars for it but great news amazon is now selling factory reconditioned machines for a thousand less than the original price and i just received mine it was immaculate shipped in an original kitchenaid box with a new manual an unopened and sealed dvd and replacement seals the only apparent difference is that manual has the year warranty crossed out replaced with a month hassle free warranty the machine looks like it is built like a tank and my year old pro line waffle baker is still going perfectly so it s up to you but i can t see the benefit of buying the full price model versus the reconditioned one so search for kitchenaid factory reconditioned frozen dessert maker and enjoy the opportunity while it lasts 
we like the dishes we are very pleased with our purchase we were able to get them much cheeper through amazon than anywhere else it pays to shop around ! as some items that amazon had were more or the same as in the department stoeres we purchased these dishes for their durability 
great orange juice i love this juicer because it is heavy enough to stay in place and it extracts all juices it s really easy to clean i had a lighter weight cheaper one before buying this one and there is no comparison in any way ! someone said it slams down and is dangerous not true kids help me and i have no fear what soever that it will hurt them it is reliable in every way 
a great deep fryer it s hard to have much to say about such a simple device this is number five or six from presto they ve all worked great and lasted well past my efforts to keep them clean keep them coming 
simply the best pies are perfect clean up is amazing the cookware is absolutely beautiful there are few things i pay good money for and even fewer things i end up not regretting this is one pie dish you will never regret owning it s wonderful and still looks as bright and perfect as the day i took it out of the box i throw it in my dishwasher without pre rinsing too ! and comes out looking as though i just brought it home i make the best apple pies i ever ate the crust is perfect every time it would be nice to thank the man responsible for such a nice tool as this 
works like a charm i love having outdoor lights at christmas but hate having to go outside before bed when it s cold and frequently snowing to unplug them this year i treated myself to this timex timer and i couldn t be happier with the results ! once plugged in the timer turns the lights on automatically at dusk which has been between and p m here in upstate new york and keeps them on as long as you specify or hours or even until dawn since we began using the timer its performance has been perfect and no more going out in the cold for me ! highly recommended 
pretty good and long lasting and compact very good booklight only thing is battery to replace is on the expensive side compact and light last quite long 
great love it ! rechargeable seems to last better than battery operated ones the design has improved too i have had two of them i love how you can dismantle this one so it won t break if packed away makes good froth too 
great gift for a rachael ray fan my wife loves rachael ray and was very excited to receive this cutting board set as a christmas gift 
drinkwell pet fountain with reservoir plus this is the perfect water dispenser for cats ! i already have one up on my sink where one feeding watering area is and i m buying another set for the floor i have cats of them neutered males and i ve noticed that my cats drink more from running water two of my cats are bengal kittens and bengals love water ! i feel much more comfortable providing my cats with water in this manner very similar to drinking from a running tap because my cats drink more and i think that this cuts down on cystitis especially in the neutered males if one has multiple cats then even the small reservoir is too small in my opinion and it has to be filled too often the charcoal filter even filters out chlorine and other things in tap water that are bad for cats 
beautiful glasses these are heavy and sturdy glasses very pretty with the handmade appearance evident in the tiny imperfections and bubbles in the glass we love them handwashing is the only drawback 
wonderful toaster i bought this toaster because i loved the color and the retro look i bought it at a williams sonoma outlet as a refurbished piece for a of the price of retail i have never had a problem with the toaster since i bought it over a year ago it makes the perfect toast what s also nice about it is it keeps the toast hot and toasty once the slice is done toasting because it doesn t pop the toast out of the toaster so if you make toast and forgot about it for a few seconds the toast will stay nice and toasty till you are ready to eat it 
le creuset rules we have a couple of le creuset enameled cast iron items and they are the best we ve used for stews and braises brown meat etc on the stovetop and then put the whole dish in the oven this soup pot is a nice size the only caveat is that the flat bottom of this one is a little bit small for folks with an electric rangetop if you plan to brown in it great for large casseroles 
i m pleased with the product i m pleased with this grinder like one of the other reviews i read i had to do the extra ajusting to get the right grind for my espresso machine but after that it s a champ also recieve lots of complaments on the style frankly all the complaints i read about in other reviews i disagree with 
love the pizza grill i have a pizza grill and i love it the pizza grill is easy to use the pizza doesn t stick to the the stone now that the weather is nice it is great to get everyone together and have everyone make their own pizzas i disagree with tom the thermometer on my high end weber never seems to match the temperature that the pizza grill does probably because the location is higher or something getting tiles from home depot can be dangerous for reasons they could have lead or other poisons that would leach out at high temperature or they would just crack 
good decanter for the price this is an excellent decanter the shape allows for easy handling and it is an excellent value i have two and would recommend this decanter to anyone requiring a simple decanter 
high quality stainless steel copper pans revere copper clad bottom pc set stainless steelis of the highest quality at an exceptional price 
it does work at first i wasn t sure if it was working but when the water evaporates i notice the cat smells again you don t even realize it s doing anything until it s not working it does require water to work it s that unobtrusive ! the smellkiller is great and i would recommend it to anyone i plan on giving these as gifts ! while it s not like you ll never have odor in your house again seems to me some people have that outrageous expectation of this product it will make a noticable difference go ahead and buy it cheaper in the long run than air freshners 
for the price works moderately well i have a year old boxer that barks cries whines and howls when i go to work all day i know i recorded it i went to petsmart and picked up this gadget brought it home and it the manual correct button she bolted she hates the ultrasonic noise that it makes it reduced the amount of noise that my dog makes but only in a certain area and i don t crate my dog when i m going to be away for more than hours so if i m just running out for a few hours i stick her in her crate with this right in front of her but if i m going to work i use it in conjunction with the petsafe electric shock bark collar my girlfriends dog does not really notice it if he s otherwise engaged but my dog hates it worth the price in my opinion best advice is to take it home and try it some dogs react to it others don t 
makes an amatuer cook feel like a pro i have tried to make rice many times with different methods and my rice is always horrible and after giving up i found this rice cooker and decided to give it a try the very first time i used it i achieved perfect rice not just great rice but to my opinion it seems like restaurant quality every time and its very simple to make with this cooker you don t even have to keep an eye on it it figures out how long its going to take to cook on its own and when the rice is done it beeps and switches into the warming function it also steams food makes cakes soup and a slow cook function 
this is the only way to drink tequila this glass and of course a good tequila as a resident of mexico for four years and a tequila obsessive i have tasted over different tequilas ranging from to per bottle riedel s is the only glass that has allowed me fully to smell taste and enjoy tequila and the only glass recognized by the consejo regulador de tequila mexico s fda of the tequila industry in my quest to enjoy the best tequilas at the lowest prices i have purchased cheaper wine flutes and just about every other glass that i have been able to find that resembles the riedel shape all however has been to no avail this glass s singular construction is unmatched for tequila unfortunately these glasses are not created equal i have owned of these glasses and from time to time i come across a poorly finished glass an unsightly stem seam a rough lip moreover this glass confounds all attempts at describing the color of tequila finally these glasses are not cheap nor are they very strong my two yearold son and i have managed to break twelve already nevertheless this is at least for the moment the only way to drink tequila for those in search of the perfect tequila i would like to share some recommendations after having spent thousands of dollars in my own search but before i begin i wish to urge all tequila drinkers to give serious consideration to boycotting cuervo and sauza these u sowned megacompanies have bought up a huge amount of the agave in mexico and have consequently had an inordinate influence on the production and price of agave with cuervo being especially destructive competition has become very difficult for other less financially powerful producers who have been going out of business selling off depressing to me was cuervo s recent acquisition of don julio whose is among my favorite tequilas before you buy from these behemoths consider what they have done to the mexican farmers smaller tequila producers and the ever rising price of tequila now on with a few recommendations keep in mind that price has been an object for me and that i have done most of my tasting in mexico so i have not been able to try some of the very expensive tequilas or tequilas that are export only also note that i have not included tequilas that are impossible to find in the u s in no particular order then my recommendations are azulejos anejo per bottle difficult to find but worth searching out this tequila is among the most flavorful and best balanced ie between agave and oak anejos that i have tried don julio anejo per bottle okay it s owned by cuervo now it s a bit overpriced and its flavor strays from agave but the exceptional complexity is mind blowing el tesoro de don felipe anejo at a strikingly pure and full flavored anejo this tequila is more readily available in the u s than in mexico chinaco reposado at around per bottle a solid pure tequila and arguably better than the over thetop oaky anejo this tequila has an artesanal flavor casa noble reposado i was able to buy this for around in mexico until like an increasing number of tequilas it apparently became available only as an export and no longer in mexico this tequila sells for around in the u s this tequila probably has the best nose of any i ve sniffed unfortunately however this tequila has one of those house flavors that permeates every tequila that its fabrica la cofradia makes and that not everyone will necessarily like corazon anejo apparently export only selling in the u s for anywhere from this is one of the better middle priced tequilas notable for its balanced and complex flavor which edges out don felipe snb perfidio is back in production i bought a bottle for about in mexico some call this the best tequila ever made but i found it so carmelized that as delicious as it was it ceased seeming to be a tequila it is however worth trying enjoy 
the last knife block you will need to buy this is the biggest knife block i could find and i love it it is very well made stable and well designed knife positions many other large blocks have the cleaver slot at the very top even thought most cleavers are only inches long while chef s knives are up to inches this block also fits many knives into a relatively small space i have had blocks that only hold or so knives and this one is not that much bigger the only competition for this block is the henckel slot block with the cleaver on top and the chef knife slots are not wide enough to hold serious chef knives read the reviews for yourself my only complaint for this block so really a rating is that it has slots for paring knives who needs little knives this is a serious block for serious cooks who generally use larger knives so i feel that little slots would be sufficient after all a little knife can fit in a large slot but not the other way around i have modified mine a bit to hold more large knives but everyone likes different knives the only thing better than this block is finding the knives to fill it with 
love it ! love it ! love it this knife is great it fits so well in my hand and i feel very comfortable using it it is light yet sturdy i sliced tomatoes today and was so excited that they came out so perfectly ! no smashed tomatoes ! i would highly recommend this knife the price is good and i will definetly be saving to buy more from furi 
great little oven this is a great little oven it reaches temperature fast and it stays at temperature the convection oven fan is a little noisy but not annoying the rotisserie feature works great but don t expect to do any large items cornish hens is the limit or a very small chicken this oven works great for drying peppers i use my drying racks from my old toastmaster convection oven 
great platter at a reasonable price i recently added this platter to a collection of much higher priced serving dishes and it is the same quality as the others ! the handles are just the right size and the glaze is very nice true white not bluish like some less expensive ceramics perfect size for a roast ham or bunch of hor d ourves 
we love it i got this for my husband for christmas and he absolutely loves it it is so easy to clean it s wonderful for pancakes eggs sausage and bacon we made shrimp fried rice on it also although some fell off while strirring i would definitely recommend this product 
wilton course book if you are like me unable to take wilton course class or just want to get a head start before taking the class this book is a great investment for you all the method taught in course class are given here with step by step color picture if you don t are unable to master the skills that is fine just practice and practice you will be ok i suggest you use a large flat dinner plate instead of the practice board its much easier to clean up or re use the buttercream i learned how to make butter cream roses and shells thanks to this book in addition to wilton s website video i suggest everyone to invest on this book you can always sell it later if you no longer want it 
well worth the extra cost i just received and tested my new miele office vac even this lowest end miele is fantastic ! it s as quiet as the one i have at home it s similarly designed easy to use and works terrifically well i am so pleased that i spent the extra money and got a really good vacuum 
a few tips for effortless use after reading the other reviews i almost reconsidered my purchase however the juicer works great as long as you follow a few tips make sure the lid is thoroughly clipped on tight ! check once then check again don t use the paper filters particularly if you are juicing in quantity once i threw mine in the trash the balancing issues went away immediately it makes clean up a little harder but if you scrape the outside with a hard toothbrush under running water right after use it s not a big deal if the item being juiced won t go through be patient and pulse push it in don t cram it with the pusher my only concern is that when you juice quantities so much pulp sticks to the side it s hard for all of the juice out to strain out it s best to rinse the drum off every couple of cups of juice using the above tips i expect to be giving this juicer some heavy use for a long time 
great supplemental light okay i haven t used this while reading in bed yet but as a supplemental light for uses in areas of minimal lighting it s great the light isn t good for areas that are adequately well lit so don t bother to use the light there but in areas where light is dim the light shines literally it casts a bright light on the page s that you need to view it s helped me tremendously get through pages of reading yes it s a bit pricey for what you get but it s incredibly compact as it fits nicely in my bag imagine carrying a lamp everywhere you go the power adapter however is a cumbersome brick as for the limited time in which the light bulb is useful for i can t offer an estimate of time yet but so far my bulb has been running for at least hours or so cumulative not consecutive hours so no complaints yet about that whenever i saw this light online or in the store i used to think why in the world would i ever want something like this now my thoughts are why didn t i ever think to buy this before 
worked great for us we have four dogs and they re pretty good at working each other into a frenzy of barking one of our neighbors strongly suggested this product as a possible remedy i did some investigation before purchasing including talking to the manufacturer their sense was that it works for about of dogs which is in line with what i saw in other on line reviews at the time this was about a year and a half ago anyway because they had a good return policy i went ahead and made the purchase and it worked wonderfully the barking dropped substantially in the corner of the yard where we put it and in fact we wished we had bought more we have a very big yard that led to our downfall we were moving it around frequently and during one of the moves it got dropped into our irrigation ditch oops needless to say it didn t work after that but remarkably the corner of the yard where we initially installed it stayed pretty quiet for several months now the grass is green the buds are blooming and the dogs are chasing squirrels and barking at phantoms that only they can perceive so it s time to replace the unit this time i m buying two and anticipating a peaceful spring and summer 
doxie corn holders these were a gift so i have not used them they were very cute and what i expected in the package 
mom this is wonderful the best laundry basket ever used 
great gate this is a low gate so if your dog is large or a jumper it may not be right for you otherwise this is a great product it is asthetically pleasing and very sturdy yet low enough to step over it s defintiely my favorite gate and i ve been through a few 
wonderful chocolate a friend provided the fountain for a wedding reception and was unaware that fountain chocolate was available he had previously mixed his chocolate through trial and error adding oil then chocolate then more oil i had read about sephra s chocolate and liked that it was pre blended with the right amount of oil to use in any chocolate fountain we gave it a try and it was a hit ! we went through three bags of chocolate in as many hours the dark chocolate provided a nice counterpoint to the sweetness of the fruit without being overly sweet being able to microwave the chocolate pour it into the fountain and walk away was wonderful 
great toy for hyper kitties if your cat wakes you up in the morning not just to eat but to play this toy will help ! i have four cats and they all love it the only negative factor is that they wear the battery out fast ! the carpeting at the base can also be used as a scratching mat this toy doesn t weigh that much but it doesn t topple easy 
good enough for the time being i am the worlds biggest procrastinator when it comes to putting together furniture ! i bought this piece along with the desk in january and here it is april and i am just now getting the job done the table part of this product was fairly easy to put together and at this point my spirits were high the file drawer on the other hand is a different story none of the pieces are labeled getting the two sides and the front to align long enough to put the screws was almost impossible and i did need to use a hammer to fishish off the screws i liked to never figure out why my drawer was not sitting right when i finally figured it out that i had it in on the wrong side overall putting it together could have been made easier with written directions instead of just pictures screws that actually screwed all the way in and pieces that are labled the file cart is a little wobbly but seems to be sturdy enough to hold my printer for the time being 
beautiful but very delicate they are elegant pieces but be very careful with them i broke one the first time i washed it by hand the stem snapped in half 
great well made product love the tilt function i bought this slicer after very extensive comparison i wanted a slicer with a stronger motor but was undecided if i really needed the tilt feature this slicer is very well made it cuts meats very thin i thought i would need to buy the optional blade for thin cuts but the blade it comes with has worked perfectly for me i have cut up ham and meat roasts the taste is wonderful not to mention the cost savings i also have cut thick steaks the ones at costco thinner to make steak sandwiches the tilt feature is advertised to gravity feed vegetables i use if for meat as well because the food falls away from the blade it is much safer and i can cut a large amout before i need to remove the accumulating pile of cut food i highly recommend this product i was also very concerned that cleaning could be so time consuming that it might cause me to not use the product as often this is not the case clean up is a breeze and can be completed in less than minutes 
popcorn maker this item is wonderful though a bit too small it makes good popcorn and is very easy to use it is worth the price and a good buy 
nice pan a little small i guess i should have taken into account measurements it is a small jelly roll pan but good quality gooey packaging came off with goo gone bakes well 
an excellent lightweight vacuum i didn t expect this vacuum to be as economical as it turned out its lightweight and has a powerful motor picks up dog hair well and cleans carpets deeply i have combination wood floors with area rugs and the floor or carpet settings are easy to switch back and forth the cup holder for dirt and dust cleans without fuss and so does the filter this nicely designed appliance makes vacuuming easy 
great dog bed our german shepherd loves this big comfy corner bed it is big enough for her to stretch out and fluffs up easily to make a very soft spot to curl up in the bolster is firm enough to support her if she lays against it or props her head up on it it does not show her white hair that stands out on every other piece of furniture in the house and it washes well the neutral color that we picked also does not draw attention to it in our bedroom i would definitely purchase this bed again if i ever need one 
just like grandma used to make my daughter and i used the v today for the first time it worked great ! just like the one my family used for over thirty years still do very easy to cook and clean the basic recipe provided comes out to thick for me but it s easily altered 
two years and running this gadget works well if you do not overfill it the misto website says to put no more than cup of oil in it we made the mistake of putting too much oil in at first and it would only stream oil for a month or so we thought it was a terrible device until the oil got down to the level where it should be i m guessing most of the unhappy reviews here are because of this problem now that we know this is the issue it sprays wonderfully ! we re going to get another one for canola 
no more leaks my last two shipments have come with a plastic sheet lining the bottom of the cartridge which totally prevents any leaks at all before the bottom of the cartridge would get a little soggy from unabsorbed cat pee but now the box stays completely intact and dry what was already a great product even with the leaking has gotten even better 
just what we needed we looked for a long time to find just what we wanted we found this set and it was a lot less expensive than some of the other pieces we were looking at they went together quickly and look quite nice they are plenty sturdy we got one for each side of the bed as well as the drawer stands and the drawer bench best of all after a year and a half in the new house our alarm clocks aren t in the floor anymore 
great little heater i bought this heater to put it under my desk at work heats really well and worths the money the only problem that i have observed is that it starts working really silent but after sometime it gets a little bit noisier but that s all bad about it it cools down pretty fast too 
big loud but makes a difference the difference in the air quality is noticable i haven t tried to clean it yet but it looks like it shouldn t be too difficult one gripe is the blue led s would be nice to turn them off but still use the functionality especially since they are purely for decoration 
more free i just wanted to add that my order on march came with dingo stix per package thats more free and they are still priced with buy get one free a great deal and the dogs love everything dingo so far 
great popcorn popper great machine pops all the kernels only drawback is the powerpop disks are hard to find needed to order them online 
if you love cookies i purchased this pan through a different company cookies cook evenly with good color can be used with parchment paper silpat but also used with cooking spray worked great with all much better than other cookies sheets on the market definitely a must have if you love cookies 
affordable riedel i ve always been a big fan of riedel glasses but they were just too expensive and broke too easily these glasses are the solution to that problem they have the right feel and weight and although there are small seams on the stems of the glasses they aren t noticeable to anyone but me i have dropped one and it didn t even break ! i highly recommend this series 
beautiful addition to collection i purchased this for my mother after she bought the set of dishes at the lenox outlet store it is just adorable ! this is a great accent if you have the butterfly meadow dishes also a great price compared to other retailers thanks amazon 
great juicer but hold on to the lid i purchased this juicer about a year ago and it s been great the only reason it doesn t get stars from me is that when it gets unbalanced you have to make sure to hold the lid on because it shakes and vibrates a whole lot the juice is great the cleanup is easy if a bit time consuming and the motor is very powerful i d definitely recommend this juicer 
the only knife you need i ll admit it i ve fallen in love i first used this knife at a friend s house and was blown away by the ease of use the ginger and garlic practically minced themselves i immediately ordered it and have been delighted ever since the handle fits my small hand perfectly and is comfortable to use it cleans in a snap and it can cut through anything no more slamming the spaghetti squash down on the table with a hatchet one of the best purchases i ve made well worth the money 
cute and reliable missing a couple features have had this for months and it works great people always compliment me on how stylish it looks as noted in another review it s hard to get the toast out early the only other nitpick i have is that there isn t a timer associated with the toaster over others i have can turn off automatically when they hit a time limit but this one you have to watch has not led to disaster yet though 
these are really great bags everything about our miele red velvet vacuumn cleaner is top notch including the bags the nicest thing about them is the way you can slide a protective piece of cardboard over the bag hole when removing the bag this prevents the dust and other vacuum dander from escaping as you walk the bag to your trash from the cleaner this is just a small detail but it exemplifies the thought that goes into this company s products 
exactly what i needed this kettle is great ! i use it several times a day it heats water quickly and doesn t require a lot of maintenance thus far it seems pretty durable i just hope it stays that way 
elegant i was so impressed with these sheets i immediately ordered a second set i recently purchased a pillowtop mattress and had to replace all my bed linens to accomodate the deep pockets needed out of the sets i purchased these are the best outranking the sealy sheets i bought per set obviously i wish i d found these first outstanding fit comfort and quality 
beautiful sea mist pitcher i decided to add this pitcher to my sea mist collection since fiestaware is discontinuing the color much to my dismay i was pleasantly surprised at how beautiful the pitcher is sea mist is much more beautiful in person and so is the pitcher it not only matches my other fiestaware pieces but is an item that i can use in any room of the house i can see it displayed on the mantle in a bedroom the bathroom as well as the kitchen if only fiestaware would continue sea mist i could order all the sizes of the pitcher and have a really nice display 
good but expensive apparently rd in the hierarchy of models in the new s series of miele vacuum cleaners the features price and accessories are not exactly linear in transition from lower to higher models nor even across series many of the older series models have more features and a higher price than the newer ones they have fancy names like capricorn red velvet and champagne leading to much confusion and forcing you to compare each one similar to buying a car if your browser has tabbed browsing eg firefox the best way to figure out which model is best for you is to go to miele s website and open a tab for each model you re interested in flip back and forth to see what text changes callisto is the cheapest no frills model of the newest series newest technology motor that still comes with an electronically powered brush the th pisces model is turbo after months of extensive use prosagility the wide seb electric powerbrush comes standard and one of the reasons i chose this model for me smaller is better while other vacuums advertise large power brushes to cover more area in a single swipe i don t have much open carpet space coffee tables chairs weight benches and computers all need vacuuming around and under the powerbrush swivels well to get around corners brush duster the most commonly used attachment for me the brush duster is also small slightly larger in diameter than the hose and the bristles are durable it s angled by default but even this plastic piece swivels to straighten out this is not mentioned anywhere you just have to figure this out for yourself on low power i was able to vacuum places that never got vacuumed before like over the spider web of computer cables and telephone wires i even vacuumed the telephone itself and other dust collecting objects on my desk parquet floor brush initially i wondered why miele would include this accessory when the powerbrush was included but this wider brush duster actually does a better job on hard tiled floors than the powerbrush the powerbrush seems more designed to churn up stuff from carpets but the paraquet brush gathers and collects dust stuck to hard surfaces better on the negative side you might have to vacuum the brush itself to unstuck the dust and i wondered why they had to inconvenience the horse for genuine horse bristles there is no permanent storage on the vacuum cleaner for the parquet brush so you have to figure out how to ensure the parts don t get separated for life the powerbrush takes precedence cord rewind the mechanical rewind sucked in the entire length of cord every single time something like for times ! the manual says to pull out the entire length of cord before use to help dissipate heat consprice after all it s just a vacuum cleaner there also seems to be price fixing in the newer s series at least when i bought this everywhere i checked maybe websites the price was exactly or with the only difference being no tax and or free shipping one website even advertised the lowest price allowed what s a diamond dealer is this amway release buttons the release buttons on the attachments and hose are counterintuitive being on the part that comes off rather than on the part that stays behind therefore you must squeeze the button with the same hand you are pulling away with the hose extension button is particularly confusing it s an oval shaped rocker button that rocks very little to extend the stainless steel hose you have to remember which side of the button top or bottom to press there is no distinction on which side to press and it s always a matter of trial and error as i yank and tug at the hose while pressing top and bottom of the extension button stiff no swivel hose the hose rotates at the top handle area but does not swivel at the base where it connects to the machine instead of disconnecting and reconnecting to get rid of twists i d rather pick up the powerhead and spin it around to get out the twists the flex hose diameter is larger than i m used to making the hose stiffer and difficult to store in the same closet where i used to store my old vacuum cleaner considering the price an electrical slip ring would have been nice bag full indicator the mechanical bag full indicator is actually an indicator of how much the vacuum cleaner is straining to suck put your hand over the end to block suction and it will indicate bag full right out of the box on short carpet it indicated bag full on high power as i turned the power down it indicated less full sequentially you have to read the instructions about using the floor tool with the tool slightly off the floor to get an accurate reading from the indicator even at that there are caveats about fine dust or pet hair that can fool the indicator extra stuff the parquet brush comes attached with a short plastic extension that was difficult to plug directly into the stainless steel hose button doesn t easily click into place the extension isn t needed to connect the parquet brush so you have to remove it and keep track of where you put it to this day i still haven t figured out what the extension is for other than to connect other attachments that i might buy in the future this is yet another piece with no place to store on the vacuum cleaner that i must ensure does not get separated for life along with the parquet brush normal filter cage and replacement bags symbol marking the power symbol markings are not obvious at all contrary to claims other than the symbols labels min and max you have to read the instructions to figure out what the other power symbols mean at least the power seems to increase sequentially as you turn the dial clockwise the quite mode is of settings with being the highest and is therefore not actually the quietest but intended to be the normal operating mode i think most people will consider max the default mode optional filter frame this model comes with a hepa filter so you don t need the filter frame unless you re going to switch to the normal filters but brand new right out of the box the frame for the normal filters came with a broken cheap plastic handle apparently due to the way it was shipped with the handle protruding out the cardboard wrapping you don t even need the handle for the frame to function properly but for the kind of money i paid nothing should be broken out of the box the vendor that i bought it from best vacuum replaced it for free so is it worth it does a good job but only time will tell 
hepa filter hamilton beach excellent product which does exactly what it is advertised to do 
highly recommended as mentioned by other reviewers the reviewer who stated that this isn t cast iron is mistaken this is a traditional old fashioned authentic chinese wok if you want a modern stainless steel wok don t buy this one if you want the type of wok used in chinese restaurants this is it the deal offered by the wok shop is a really good one and you ll be hard pressed to find this good of a deal on an authentic wok anywhere else to learn more about the wok shop the store selling this wok and tane chan the store s owner you should read gourmet magazine s dec article on the shop 
handy cordless blender i love my cuisinart cordless blender no cords to get in the way and easy to use when traveling by car no power cord needed charges quickly and can easily be taken apart for storage or transport this is my second csb nkeep one at work and one at home ! i should note that i have had my first blender for years and it still works great i run the blender until the battery is discharged before recharging it to avoid battery problems 
the best this is such a great pan for omlets because of the sloped sides that allow you to slide underneath this would be a great first peice of cast iron for someone new to using it because of the size and it is pre seasoned i use it all the time amp it just keeps getting better 
neat n dry perfect for my needs it took a little while to receive them but once i started using them i was very surprised at how well they worked they hold quite a lot before changing and they don t tear apart as some other brands have done i am very satisfied with the quality the size is perfect for my needs they work so well that this is my second order a very very good product thank you trish 
great pizzelle maker i have had another pizzelle maker for years the prego is so much better it s easy to use clean up is fast the pizzelles are thin and crispy i would highly suggest buying it 
okey it works fine however it arrived without a base and amazon was unable to find a replacement part or another fan like it foertunately i was able to rig one up for i 
reliable and easy to use i ve used a lot of different blenders over the years and i ve never come across one with this low of a cost and this kind of reliability it chops and blends anything i throw at it and cleaning it up is so much easier because of it s small size great for college when you don t have a lot of spac 
the best canner pressure cooker i ve owned i do lots of cooking and canning sometimes just for family sometimes for large gatherings and this cooker has made that chore much easier even when cooking for family i ll make chickens at a time that way i won t have to cook another night while the chickens are cooking i ll also have stock to make rice or soup with forgot about cooking dinner this baby can take frozen rabbits from the freezer to the dinner table in less than an hour its large size makes canning large batches quick work the only drawback i have is washing it it is heavy and if you don t have a big enough sink or a hose to rinse it out then your in for a workout i have a double sink and it fits in nicely a must for anyone with a large family 
just what i was looking for i was looking for a tool to process the exotic fruit i grow and amazon had the largest selection 
great pillowtop for the price we recieved the pillowtop promptly it is quite full and puffy well made we are using it on our guestroom bed and so far every one has had a great night sleep 
good but nothing like a commercial cleaning this machine is probably one of the best for household cleaning but don t expect it to turn out like a professional job it s definitely better than renting a rug doctor though 
good pillows these pillows are still new so the jury is out on how well they ll hold up over time but so far they do provide decent support and a good night s sleep worth the investment while i d stop short of calling them luxury they are nice 
made in india as with all my red dishtowels these are made in india this is my first time using dishtowels i chose red so i wouldn t hesitate to wipe up colored fluids i washed these super hot and dried them in the dryer first thing they are fine and lovely so if you have s bad experiences with textiles from india be assured that things have changed for the better this is the cheapest price i have found for dishtowels so far i m trying to cut down on paper towel usage especially for drying my hands so this purchase alleviates a small degree of dismay at my pollution of the planet i use these all the time 
fast and beautiful i received this hutch just three days after i ordered it and it was in flawless shape when it got here the color is beautiful and the piece is very heavy sturdy solid wood the desk in this set was a bit too small for what i was needing so i ordered a walnut dining table from target and they blend wonderfully well together the hutch is pretty large so it holds quite a bit of office supplies paperwork etc you won t go wrong with this choice 
great multipurpose i have these and love them i m glad i didn t waste my time with some look alikes i saw these are the same quality as the rest of my fiestaware and match perfectly i use these for hot cocoa loaded down with marshallows chili soup cereal it s a bowl it s a cup the cup is heavy enough that it can sustain some abuse from daily use and keep you from getting burned by the hot stuff inside i really love these cups 
to cute cookie jar this was a gift for my boss who is very picky and she thought it was great this was the perfect gift it was very very cute 
the best cervical roll for me at least as a physical therapist who suffers from neck pain this is the only pillow that i can use without waking up to having cervical muscle spasms in the mornings this pillow is great for people who do not have the normal curvature of the cervical spine a ka straight necks cervical arthritis etc i bought one years ago at cvs have been looking for a year now for a replacement since mine cannot support my neck very well anymore it has been a week that i have been waking up to neck spasms i am delighted to find that it is here at amazon it was here all along i just have been typing in the wrong name cervical pillow cervical roll neck roll etc i am happy that i remembered what my year old son called it bone typed it and boy was he right 
sweepa furemover brush i received my combo package of furemover brush mini brush and mitt combo i m not terribly impressed with the mitt but the brush is the best thing i ve even tried for picking up pet hair my yellow lab has been shedding like mad with hair absolutely coating her pet bed i took the brush to the bed and it swept hair right up into piles which i was able to vacuum up i had been trying everything and this is the quickest easiest and most efficient means of removing pet hair i ve ever seen 
love it ! love it ! love it very sturdy construction much better than i expected i made whole wheat bread the other day and it didn t even hesitate to blast through the dough my wife has used it several times and loves it too i origonally wanted to get her a kitchenaid but i did a lot of research on the best mixers and i agree that this is the best value for your money 
sugar bowl very nice product fast shipping alittle disappointed in the size of the container but overall very please 
worked great for us this works well you do have to adjust the oven temp for the darker pan i was worried about using non non stick tools on it but it did not scratch 
cordless hand blender the csb n hand blender is an amazingly compact unit works great for drinks and veg puree for soups love the cordless feature ! 
stanton not just ice tea these are my coffe mug stirers and mayo jar extractors too we reach for them all the time stanton has a nice weight good quality no dishwasher discoloration arrived perfectly packaged 
excellent machine we ve been using it now for about four months with out a problem it works well on breads meats and cheese contrary to the previous comment the unit is easy to clean and in my opinion some people wash there hands times a day too i would recommend this unit to all who wish a rugged and dependable product 
great for musicians i use this for my brass ensemble we often play in chirches with few light this led lights are just what we need they are really bright and white lights and cover both music sheets on the music stand they also last very long with aaa batteries 
mixed opinion i like the ability to cook on the burner only need to dirty one pot but the shape of this crock pot is curvy so you can t pour out of it without the food getting hung up on the lip of the crock pot the shape is odd in that the bottom is small and the top is wide if it s not entirely full i just put a piece of tin foil over the contents 
garbageman great can ! looks good and very convenient ! make sure you measure your cabinet before purchasing most cabinet maybe too small to fit this can you may have to remove a shelve inside of your cabinet or if your sink is a corner sink you can angle the can to fit 
very good i was very pleased with how quickly i received the stroller it was package well it took a couple of minutes to assemble and it was ready to go plus it was affordable very sturdy easy to manuver and get down stair it is such a blessing to have one of these my westie is a bit overwieght lbs and he loves it he has room to stretch out sit up i can see him at all times because of the mesh veiwer i can take him on the train in stores where ever i want because he s secured and enclosed i get alot of compliments and some strange looks because it looks just like a baby stroller even better than some of them i was told the only thing i would say bad about it is that the mesh cover has a toxic smell to it but once i took it outside a couple of times it did air out and the smell is gone also to make it more comfortable i did place a cusion lining inside otherwise i thought it was great i highly recommend it for anyone who wants to travel with pets have older pets don t own a car and would like an easier way to take your pet to vet visits parks or where ever 
a great machine after getting poor results from a steam driven krups i decided to give home espresso brewing another try with a pump driven machine after many days of research i settled on the villaware moderno in addition to good reviews it was the only pump machine in this price range that did not have a boxy or plastic look all in all i a very happy with my purchase the machine heats up fast its easy to use and the foamer is fool proof i steamed half and half for my cappucino and got mountains of very stable foam on the first try ! for espresso i used the illy pods that came with it and got very satisfactory results the espresso was plenty hot and had a moderate amount of crema but i understand that you get less crema anyway if you use pods the hot water dispensing feature also works fine i dispense the hot water into a large pyrex measuring cup for preheating the espresso cups some things worth mentioning cleaning in addition to washing everything with soapy water i ran tanks of water through the system before i could get rid of that metallic smell definately run water through the steam nozzle before using it i noticed little particles of stuff coming out in the rinse water dripping yes the portafilter does drip after you stop brewing but i shove a shot glass under the spout after i remove the cup and no problem 
beautiful dishes dishes are just as pretty as they look but are not quite as bright colored as they show are a nice color would not want them any brighter plates and bowls are a nice size cup could be a little bigger but the size most sets carry waiting for add on pieces i have a light tan colored rice bowl and vegetable size bowls from my other set that i bought seperately that matches these pretty well that i kept like the rice bowl size really well for soups they are corelle extras rgis is my rd set of corelle 
sturdy and practical these clips are sturdy stainless steel and they stand up to my two boys they are also magnetic and i can put them high on the refrigerator to keep them out of reach so far they are holding up better than the brightly colored plastic oxo clips that my two year old destroyed in minutes worth the extra money 
amazing this little gadget is the best thing to come on the market since widgets it doesn t look like much but the spoon fits easily in it and all the drippings fall right back in the pot rather than on a spoon holder on the stove for anything without lids it is amazing 
best popcorn popper microwave or normal makes the best popcorn i found use peanut oil and any junk popcorn and it pops up light and fluffy clean up is not bad cause it s just a removeable bowl that gets messy i get about bowls out of a concentrator before it needs to be replaced so a pack of gets you about bowls of popcorn the pack sell on amazon presto powercup concentrators for so not a big deal i m using a pretty small unpowerful microwave and have no problems i m not sure why the previous negative reviews cause i think it works great it says dishwasher safe but i would not recommend it like all plastic it will become brittle over time in the dishwasher i would love to have a glass version of this 
heavy duty solid and very sharp this pizza wheel from kitchenaid is a very solid product its hefty weight is balanced nicely and comes razor sharp from the factory the plastic blade cover protects the cutting surface from nicks in your kitchen drawer and it also protects your clumsy fingers too 
excellent value great for people who love cooking and will put it to use i d recommend the product to anyone 
love the pillow hate the smell this pillow is exactly what i was looking for in a memory foam pillow it s supportive regular pillow shaped not too tall etc my only complaint was the horrible smell of the latex or whatever it is foam i understand this is common with these pillows so i washed it in the bathtub with a small amount of mild detergent it took nearly a week to completely dry no wringing the foam however once it was dry no smell ! thereafter i ve been pleased with my pillow i ll definitely purchase another one whenever this one reaches its end of life 
just lovely the flowers not only arrived in good time they were also so lovely my friend who loves roses was very impressed definitely a great purchase 
finally i ve tried several different types of pillows including a water pillow but this is the first to give me a good night s sleep i tend to sleep on my stomach and this pillow seems very good for all sleeping positions total support witout being too high it offers support even when i have my head on the edge of the pillow with water pillows and others the support just flows away from the edge and i m left flat love this pillow mmmmm 
was skeptical but not anymore i was worried that these collars would somehow allow them to choke because they don t break away they open i thought that maybe they wouldn t open or maybe the ring would get caught but so far they haven t with other break away collars my cats would maybe have them on for days and then they would be lost to the woods never to be found again they have had these for almost a week and they have not lost them yet nor have they snagged or loosened at all plus the cats can t get them off like they could the other break away collars and it s so small in width that it hasn t matted there hair a wonderful product and i would definitely reccommend to anyone who has a problem keeping collars on their cats at a couple of bucks a piece you can t beat it 
astoundingly clean and useful this is the best tool for dismantling a whole chicken safer than a knife and you can take it apart easily and put it in the dishwasher to disinfect and then reassemble it easily in second i use it also for trimming fat off of pork lamb beef etc and it s invaluable for removing extra fins etc from fish 
very handy i want two sets these canisters are great i intend to buy a second set they keep food fresh convenient and much tidier than the packages you buy it in the lids are secure and easy to use and they stack well i also like the fact that they re opaque because i use the smallest one for coffee which keeps better if stored away from light 
indestructable these are without question the greatest spatulas ever ! over the years i have thrown away plenty of spatulas usually because they deteriorate quickly and start to leave traces of white rubber behind the le creuset s can handle high heat and really clean out bowls and bottles the price startled me but after using one i bought several more these will last forever finally a perfect spatula 
eureka boss upright only used once so far and seems to work fine the lever to switch from carpet to bare floor was a little stiff doesn t seem to stay in place but it did turn off the brush 
party favorite this new margarita maker was the hit at out annual family christmas party easy to use easy to clean up and best of all it just makes a great drink if you like frozen drink this is a must have in your ba 
excellent product highly recommend i absolutely love these potholders i have four sets of them they are great as potholders but they also have other uses i place them under cutting boards to keep them from sliding on the counter when i am chopping i also use them to keep bowls firmly on the counter if i am whipping cream i also use them as trivets when placing hot pans on my counter top my only caution regarding this product is that you need to be aware of the location of the hole in one corner of the potholder i didn t pay attention one day and got a nasty burn pulling a very hot pan out of the oven if you are a bit of a klutz like me best to keep aloe in the house just in case you do what i did repeated applications of aloe took the burn out of the fingertip in a few hours i was very fortunate i hope this doesn t happen to you i highly recommend this product 
great product this is simply a great timer very easy to use and you don t have to push a key repeatedly to reach a number to count down from because you enter it directly all timers should be this easy 
gimme a break i received this set and it s gorgeous and in the colors stated in the description perhaps the other customer should have called amazon and let them know that they received the wrong dish set mystic is only offered in this color palette 
hooray i bought this to help organize my children s play room and this is perfect for their board games some of the games are a little long and stick out the front but that isn t a problem i m considering purchasing another for hats gloves and the like the item is very sturdy and built well 
a great pan i have quite a few pieces of cast iron and this pan is one of my favorites it works great for thin crispy crust pizza but it also works well as a griddle although i have another lodge griddle this works better because it only takes up burner and its width allows more freedom in where you place things the only minor problem is that if you cut your pizzas on the pan you ll wind up cutting through the seasoning 
i can use on my glass top this is a solid piece it doesn t swivel around on my glass top stove it s great to have a griddle on two burners ! i love this item 
a great great knife i really love this knife especially the handle it form fits into my palm and has a decent satisfying heft to it that some of my larger chef s knives just don t have when i m looking for a knife i m looking for this one every time it s also managed to keep a good edge for quite a long time i think you ll be happy if you buy this one and if you re like me you may even want to replace all of your knives with this line can t recommend it highly enough 
thank you rachael this knife is the most outstanding piece of cutlery i have ever used in my life i have given my chefs knife to goodwill after i first used my rachael more to the point my daughter has been a professional chef for almost years has prepared dinners for three president s of the united states and has been an executive chef at two fine restaurants in the middle atlantic area she has tried my rachael and i had a hard time keeping her from walking off with it that will be a chanukah present for her she is a top flight carver and on labor day at a large family outing she will be using my rachael on a steamship round of beef the knife speaks for itself from the moment you pick it up to the moment you put it down and literally sings in between 
yes ! a product that does what it promises to do after spending hundreds of dollars and hours upon hours of my time washing my floor with swiffer type products i got tired of pushing around dirty water and chemicals only to have to go over the floors with towels to sop up the remaining residue i will admit i did not have high hopes for this unit though it promises to clean throughly i thought sure thats what they all say well i can tell you this one actually does what it says it will ! i washed my floor with the swiffer mop i waited till the floor dried and went over it with this unit you can not beleive the dirt that was on the units mop head what really impressed me was when i lifted the rug next to the exposed tile and both colors matched which meant the floor was just as clean as tile that had not been exposed to shoes if this works this good on ceramic tile on high traffic areas i know this will be great for all its other uses 
powerful little electric broom i own an oreck vacuum for the rugs in the kids room but of my house approx sq feet is sealed hardwood oak floors i have two dogs a rottweiler and a jack russell terrier who shed quite a lot year round the oreck is very good for the carpeted areas but the beater bar feature just sort of blows the dirt and hair around the wood floors and is clumsy in the corners after reading the reviews i decided to try the euro pro shark the price was great with free shipping it s very small and lighthweight which is a plus and stores easily in my broom closet it has a lot of suction power on the wood floors and picks up all the dog hair easily even in the corners and under the radiater registers i ve tried other electric brooms but they didn t have anywhere near the suction of the shark and are made much more cheaply the last one i had actually snapped in half if you re looking for a heavy duty vacuum for carpets this is not the one but if you want a powerful little electric broom for hard floor surfaces i would highly reccomend this one 
classic design these days most people choose an elegant open stock stainless steel flatware pattern for both their formal and casual placesettings this mikasa italian countryside pattern is an enduring classic that matches the mikasa white stoneware line with the same name and it also goes well with bia white porcelain and mikasa libretto stoneware placesettings this four piece hostess set includes a cold meat fork serving spoon pierced serving spoon and gravy ladle you ll probably want to add some open stock serving pieces to this set such as more serving spoons and forks this flatware has a nice feel good balance lovely design and is made of heavy duty gauge stainless steel it s dishwasher safe and it keeps its gleaming finish for a long time many people like to keep their sets of good stainless flatware in wooden chests and use less costly patterns for everyday dining i ve been using mikasa flatware for more than ten years and i think it s comparable in every way to oneida 
best mitts yet i just today received the pair of oxo silicone oven mitts i ordered and used them immediately for today s bread baking which involved getting a hot crock in and out of the oven these mitts work marvelously i felt no heat through them from the oven they protect my wrists very well and best of all they are much more flexible than the usual waffled oven mitt i am sold on these and am about to order them for a number of my friends they will get frequent use in my kitchen 
good coffee this is not the first french press i have purchased i like that it is unbreakable i just wish it were a little bigger 
very nice bought as a filler to get free shipping gave to a friend who owns a ot of this design she loved it 
le creuset mini cocotte this miniature pot is decorative as well as utilitarian since it can be used on the flame for melting butter or small amounts of sauces 
cool little blender i use this blender to make protein shakes every day and it handles blending frozen fruit very easily and best of all takes up very little counterspace highly recommended especially for apartment dwellers 
by far the best coffee maker i ve ever owned who wouldn t want to wake up every morning and have not only freshly brewed but freshly ground coffee waiting for them no we don t have a butler we have a coffee team ok i ll admit the price of this coffee maker seemed a little high in the beginning my husband is a coffee fanatic and i wanted to get him a coffee maker for his birthday that would hopefully last longer than months and reduce his morning coffee making time immediately after discovering the coffee team i started doing the math on how many starbucks drive thru trips my husband could make for the price of this coffee maker and realized that in the end this would be more cost effective for our budget i can t say enough about the quality of this coffee maker i was initially skeptical as the coffee pot part appeared to be similar to several of the other no longerfunctioning coffee makers we have lying around our garage i will admit that there isn t anything super fancy about the actual coffee maker part itself but it is the incredible attached burr grinder water filter and array of digital settings that sets this coffee maker apart it comes with a manual and a video we never watched the video but we did study the manual to figure this thing out once you get your settings right and make a couple of pots of coffee it is really quick and easy to whip up a pot of fabulous coffee i love to drink coffee but was notorious for making coffee too strong or too weak also i could never really figure out how much to grind to make the perfect coffee the coffee team really makes it easy to make a great cup of coffee without having to over think it we love the three separate strength settings mild medium and strong which actually change the flavor unlike some of the other coffee pots we ve tried this really comes in handy when we switch from milder to richer beans we also appreciate the ability to switch the number of cups we make with the touch of a button it also has a reminder light to change the water filter which i need i never realized how much water quality affected coffee but now i can definitely tell when the filter needs to be replaced i was a little skeptical about having to buy replacement filters but they are only for a pack sold here at amazon spend more than and they ll ship em to you for free i will warn you that when you switch coffee brands or flavors you may need to make small adjustments to the settings for different beans but ultimately this coffee pot always makes a great cup of coffee i highly recommended the coffee team as the ultimate gift for the coffee lover in your life ! 
bright night i used to stumble through rooms at night rather than turn on bright lights this compact fixture does a beautiful job illuminating corridors or rooms with white led light it s bright enough to cast a shadow but not too bright for dark adjusted eyes there s not much difference between the high and low settings and both led s are illuminated on low they have a polarized plug and only fit one way in the socket aiming the light upward and outward they don t feel warm to the touch even when they ve been on for hours the low power consumption is a plus too 
all clad stainless quart colander love it this is an excellent colander i love it all my cookware is all clad stainless steel so i decided to buy this colander and have not been disappointed although this is the smaller of the two sizes all clad makes it is very roomy this colander can drain a pound of pasta even a pound of lasagna without any problems it is also great for rinsing salad the solid side handles make it very easy to manage it is made very well and is very sturdy the cleanup is also very easy highly recommended 
you will love this griddle this griddle is worth at a minimum when i opened the box i was pleasantly surprised with the wieght and feel of this product it is calphalon which is always great cookware so i should not have been so surprised 
the garlic twist i purchased of the above as stocking stuffers for the christmas holidaysmy daughter has just yesterday raved about this product saying how greatand simple it was to use i m sorry i didnt get one for myselfi actually forgot the site where i purchased it if this can be givento me i would certainly appreciate i 
proctor silex can opener we are completely satisfied with this product good value and a quality product that performs as advertised 
excellent fan excellent fan i have a smaller patton that i bought about years ago and it is noisy too industrial strength fans are noisy moving air makes noise a very good fan well built and i think it s a good value for 
best dog toy ever my dogs love this toy ! granted that they only last a month or two in my house but when i do have them my dogs love them a lab pitbull mix and a shih tzu both love to play with them and my lab mix really loves the sound he just goes around honking all day long definatally worth the buy to see if your dogs love it like mine do they also come in small sizes for toy dogs if you don t want a big one 
nice pillow just like it s rated this pillow is worth the cost it does take a few days to get use to but when you do it s great 
heavy duty for all purpose i love these ordered three sets of these brick red colored mini bowls for my family and continue to be pleased with the performance they are good quality little things used for yogurt ice cream nuts little snacks for the kids and are microwave oven and dishwasher safe try them for yourself they come in a multitude of different designs kudos ! 
fantastic bought this item to keep the neighbors cats out of my garden it works great those little felines take one step in my flower bed and are blasted with water never see more than sets of footprints one in one out i am thinking about buying another one for another part of my garden 
best frother frothed milk without the watering down inevitable with steaming ! plus an ingenious recharging system that bypasses ever needing batteries a must buy for capuccino aficionados 
dont pay more this is a great cheap decanter don t waste your money on a more expensive brand model 
inviting salad set this lovely salad set will be a great addition to any lunch or dinner setting the serving bowl is much larger than i anticipated and great for tossing space the individual bowls are also deep this is a great set for salad lovers 
good item at a reasonable price produced crispy foods quickly but be careful not to overload it you must use a lightly used electrical circuit or it can trip the breaker it takes a long time to heat up but recovers after the first batct quickly for a frier this large i recommend it 
perfection this compact unit is comfortable in the hand attractive on the counter and works incredibly ! froths even whole milk so fast better than more expensive and bulkier units in performance yeah 
know your water love the unit itself however after days of running it only hours a night i noticed the filter guage was saying replace filter so i called the company to say hey it s only been days i think the filter guage is broken and they had me check the filter it was yellow and crusty and they said no it s your water you need to replace your filter or use distilled water then she laughed and said they had customers that replace their filters several times a week because of their waterso of course i m not going to replace my filter every days and i m not going to use a couple gallons of distilled water every night before i go to bed in this thing so if you have hard water this may not be the unit for you buyer beware 
love it granted it is a bit noisy at first more like a shocking sound not so much noisy but you get used to it the mixing and matching of different drinks takes some skill especially if you ve never used any of the larger office machines this was a complete first for me i mixed a few watered a few too many in my attempts at different mug sizes but i got the hang of it and love it i commute to work and no longer stop to get my coffe each moring at to a cup so there s a huge savings in this product and the tea is the best i ve ever had they actually add juice concentrates in the pack some selections so the tea is very flavorable the machine itself was a little odd as far as trying to place it on the counter but i think that is the case with just about any new appliance you bring into your home it will always stick out at first i bought black and it looks great there really isn t any cleanup at all other machines i looked at in the store seemed a little trickier to use or had sharp needles poking out to pop packages and stange buttons this really is so simple finding a place to store the coffee is a differnet matter because the packs are bigger than most pods it is a challenge i ended up with mine in a basket in my pantry the round display rack that flavia offers looks pretty neat i will definately buy that over all it s a perfect product in my opinion 
love it after years of laying clothes out to dry on couches the floor and on hangers that warped the shape of clothes i finally did a little research of drying racks i purchased this one after reading the great reviews and i must say that i agree i love it ! it really does fold down flat and stores easily i also want to add that amazon shipped it in a big box with lots of air pockets so there was no damage to the product as other people have complained about so amazon is listening ! thanks ! april 
a good value i purchased one of these yesterday and i am very happy with it it moves a lot of air and it is fairly quiet anything with a motor will make some noise it is very quiet on low speed and as you increase the speed to super it gets a little louder most of the noise is not from the motor which is very quiet it is from the moving air and does it move ! this cooled off a x room better and more quietly than an air conditioner it fits in your window so it does not take up floor or counter space and you don t need to worry about pets or children knocking it over i like this better than the floor fan i bought so much so that i am returning the floor fan and getting another honeywell window fan there is a more expensive model with a remote but i didn t think the extra money was worth it bottom line a well made product from a name you trust and a good value for the price 
nice product i bought this for my office i looks great and works fine it also was received very fast i was amazed how quickly i received it one issue though it has one of the most lacking owner s manuals so be prepared for trial and error i know a fridge is not the most complicated equipment but i had to guess which way the cold adjustment knob was supposed to go to make the fridge colder the knob is also down in the back so if you have to adjust it is a bit of a reach now that i figured things out though i really am pleased 
pleased buyer these dishes are just what i needed for every day use what with one husband and four grandchildren who inevitably drop one dish or another this is just what i needed and am very happy that i found it at such reasonable prices 
most useful item in my kitchen i have had this for almost months and use this for almost everything the chopping accessory is great for onions tomatoes etc i do a lot of indian cooking and this is a huge time saver easy to clean a ton of power have had to use my regular hand blender as this has so many accessories the balloon wisk is great for whipped cream and egg whites etc cannot recc this enough use this every time i cook 
perfectly sized i like the last reviewer found that the bowls in the piece service for sango gold dust black are quite large these bowls are the perfect size for ice cream or cereal very nice appearance and feel i ordered a full set of sango dishware from amazon com and all of it shipped very well protected and not a problem with the items at all 
my new coffee maker i had a problem intially with the purchase of this coffeemaker but withgood listeners at etronics i was able to get excellant service as far as the coffeemaker i dearly love this machine it makes the freshest coffee and the taste is like that you buy at a coffee house theonly change to the coffeemaker i would like to see is that when the coffeemaker starts its a very startling noise this coffeemaker to me is the best by far of other coffeemakers 
stainless steel paper towel holder excellent product just as described it is a very sturdy holder 
great alternative to non stick i was looking for a pan to cook eggs omlets in but didn t want to get non stick or teflon or whatever this pan was recommended by the nytimes it s not as perfect as an old seasoned cast iron skillet but the le creuset pan is big heavy and practically non stick especially if you use a bit of oil i cook everything in it chicken hamburgers fried eggs and omlets sausage pancakes and it s easy to clean almost as non stick as my teflon pans which i chucked for what it is it s pretty great 
great blanket very comfortable i ve had this for a few months now i ve found it to be perfect except on very cold nights but then i add a comforter also it s machine washable and came out very well which was a bit of a surprise considering it s filled very please 
so useful this bowl is shallow enough to serve from and deep enough to really load it up i use mine constantly and didn t think i would when i bought it we reach for this ahead of all the other bowls and platters i own i love my fiestaware you can t go wrong with these durable and colorful dishes 
great set of knives i received these knives as a gift for xmas and i love them they are beautiful and are very sharp ! i have heard that they rust if not cleaned right away and dried so i am preventing this by doing so i have heard that all good knives rust so it is not as though these are the only set that might 
t fal fryer i recommend this fryer i have had other fryers in the past and highly recommend this one easy to use and extremely easy to clean as well as storing the oil frys food quickly and parts go right into the dish washer 
mikasa iced tea spoons these spoons have a substantial feel in your hand and are of excellent quality for such a low price the satin finish with shiny edges is a nice complement to my satin butterfly meadow stainless 
looks high quality i have had many good experiences with the farberware brand i ordered this set and it feels like quality skip the lower grade sets even the lower grade farberware and go for this set that feels like it ll last for well over a decade 
good product i have used this product for about a month and i find it to work well some coffee grinds escape the plunger but i expected that 
great filter it works as advertised does a very good job and is worth the money 
best deal on amazon simply awesome its better than the top of the line which i have too this was the mixer buy of a lifetime because of the free shipping everyone else wanted shopping if you can wait days for free shipping and add something else small to get your order over it was when i bought it anything over was free shipping there isnt a better mixer deal out there its big sturdy and works just as well as a new one no scratches no imperfections get more than one as a gift now im coffee maker shopping any suggestions 
beautiful but on the small side they are very pretty i love the coloring and the high gloss i just was expecting them to be a bit bigger 
best cat toy ever this toy is great it keeps them occupied for hours i can not recommend it highly enough it can be an interactive toy you can just put it on the floor and leave them to themselves or you can mount it to a wall and watch them play with it for hours we have gone through quite a few of these with our cats and they are always an easy gift for friends cats buy one and see 
fine fiskar scissors these scissors work wonderfully i had two pairs of large scissors in my kitchen one with a broken point and neither cut well having used fiskar scissors before outside my home and finding them great i decided to buy two to replace my old ones the fiskars not only cut smoothly but since they are in the kitchen they sometimes get sticky and dirty from opening packages of sauce cutting tape etc these scissors have a coating on the blades that enable them to be cleaned easily with just a damp sponge paper towel or brush and a drop of detergent and they are like new no rusty hinges or screws that make cutting a chore like my old ones 
my cat loves it sigh cats are so picky you never know what they re going to like if i had a nickel for every toy i have purchased that they never gave a second glance one trick i have learned is not to make a huge fuss over a new toy they seem to like to discover things on their own so when i bring a new toy home i just set it on the floor and walk away don t even act like it s for them i find that they respond better that way one of my cats loves this thing and the other won t even look at it i rate it a because the cat that does like it goes crazy for it and i don t even use catnip he loves scratching on it swatting the little ball around and he even falls asleep on it sometimes too cute i have bare floors but i don t have a problem with the toy sliding around because my cat stands on the outside of the toy and it rests against his hind paws as he scratches with his front paws he figured it out on his own and he doesn t have any trouble with it also make sure you turn the refill over and use the other side as well 
better than prescription my golden retriever has had ear infections since she was weeks old over the years we have tried allergy shots dietary changes and prescription ointments all costing a fortune we tried zymox and it is absolutely fantastic her ear infections clear within a few days of treatment the itching and head shaking stop immediately after application and if i treat her ears once or twice a week after an infection clears i can keep her clear this stuff is great and at the price of prescription and no vet charges i m happy to keep it on hand 
great little alarm what a surprise to get so much for so little this is a perfect little travel alarm that does exactly what it s supposed to do very simply 
so comfy these sheets are so pretty and really comfy silky they are tough to get wrinkles out though 
great cutting board this cutting board is all that it is advertized to be i liked mine so much that i went out and bought a smaller version being able to put the cutting board in the dishwasher makes this my favorite cutting board and one that i look forward to using on a daily basis 
great quality excellent value these stools are very sturdy and well worth the price the cushion material is a little plain but overall they provide excellent quality at an unbeatable price 
mine is years young and still going strong have never gotten it sharpened and just give it a quick treatment with the honing steal before and after use it s still sharp enough to cut a finger off if you are not paying attention the blade does flex and this may be somewhat of an advantage when carving poultry the tip has bent so keep in mind this is a carver rather than having the heft of a chef s knife i have the filet knife paring knife and honing steel in this set i really have no complaints about any of the henckels star line 
good value and be aware that it is not top of the line cookware it s a little lighter which might be an advantage for some people i bought several of these as gifts and the only negative i heard is that it seemed to scratch a bit easily having said that i would have used only wooden or plastic utensils anyway so that would probably have been avoided for the money it s worth a shot you can always use it as a planter 
great match even when i bought the fiestawere cinnabar creamer i loved it right away but to order the cinnabar covered suger bowl from a nother seller and have them match so well i am so happy that my sugar bowl is such a perfect match thank 
granpappy it was a christmas gift truly enjoyed by my grandson who loves to cook with supervision it s easy to store and able to keep the oil in its container for several uses bigger than the grandaddy so you can cook more at one time it s great have one myself and it has been with us for years 
these work great but i can t give them stars because they cost too much for dinky pieces of plastic for pieces of plastic to cost this much is outrageous these do work in my senseo they make great coffee and tea just load them and stap the top on they have to be put into the cup pod holder i bought these and was shocked at the high price of shipping the shipping was more expensive than the pods they came in a bubble wrap lined envelope just use common sense and let them cool before trying to clean them 
best thing with sliced bread a friend broke her butter bell and was going to order another one we both choose this one and i bought and extra for my mom all three of us love it it washes up nicely in the dishwasher when it gets messy it has a better top than the one she had before which was hard to grip this one is great 
beautiful i bought this as a gift for my mother who loves lenox it s absolutely beautiful no complaints 
plates are good thats about it i bought these during an amazon one day sale for me and my girlfriend are soon looking to get our own place and wanted to buy something that is decent but not two expensive i ll try to give good descriptions of everything to give the buyer a good idea of what to expect when amazon says lbs they are not kidding it is a very heavy box towle silversmiths are the actual company that makes the set they are made in china according to the box it is dishwasher safe but is not microwave safe that would be due to the metal band around the edges of the plates this review is for the platinum set amazon didn t have it listed on the website when i was going to review them so this is close enough all the items appear very nice the bands are all uniform and matching it looks like tableware you would expect to find in a nice new england bed and breakfast very timeless and classic but modern in a sense as well the plates bowl s and coffee cups are nice and heavy and look quite elegant they are of good weight and don t feel flimsy at all they come with decorative plates for underneath the main plate however i wouldn t ever consider using them the only they they are useful for is target shooting or playing frisbee the flatware is ok they are on the light side and somewhat bland the forks and spoons flex but also appear as if they would bend under normal use the knifes feel ok but again all the flatware is on the flimsy side i would recommend getting an additional set somewhere else they are not so thin that they would bend right away like the usual college first set that most people would buy at either linens and things or bed bath and beyond or target but i ve had better the wine glasses are the same way they are a medium thickness glass they are by no means high quality but they are not the cheapo ones you would expect to find at target or the cheap ones at lnt or bbb one of mine had an air bubble in it im gonna request a new one from amazon they are ok tall stems and good base they feel very sure footed on the table and accompany the dishes nicely in design they are a large bowl red wine glass design if you need the dishes buy it they are well worth what i paid for it for the dishes alone i plan on buying new flatware the glasses i ll use till they break overall for i am very pleased and wish i had bought a second set for the plates alone 
nice kittle the kittle looks good and i tried it was not very fast but was accepted 
nothing i can complain about it is a forged knife at close to stamped price the edge came right up to snuff after a few passes on a steel i bought it and their large santuku and am quite happy with both purchases i ll use the santuku a lot more but this is a kitchen standard item i had a nice forged one but it went missing gotta be more careful 
not a great serving platter i purchased this item because the description said it would make a great serving platter as well as a casserole however when i received it the sides were definitely too high to make this a platter it would have looked exactly like i was serving food in a casserole it s very durable and looks sharp and might make a great casserole but i don t recommend it for a serving tray at all 
agree with rating i ve been looking for a good insulated oz mug for a few years and never could find what i wanted in stainless steel in this size i d never heard of timolino but after reading the reviews of other amazon users decided to order a mug once again the reviewers at amazon called it right the mug keeps the coffee hot for hours and i particularly like the shape since i don t need a mug to fit in a cup holder my husband has his eye on it and something tells me i ll have to order one for him soon 
large big or huge pot make sure you really understand the size of this pot before ordering i mean this thing is huge said that i like it all arround heats even handles maintain reasonably warm not hot nice the see through lid and overall it looks very professional 
makes great waffles this is a reliable easy and fun touse waffle maker that is light weight and takes up very little cupboard space waffles were light and tasty the gimmick of flipping the maker over although a wee bit cumbersome seems to add to the lightness of the resulting product i ve only tried this with the enclosed recipes and have not used it as yet with packaged mixes but if i were consumer reports i d give this a best buy for low price ease of use and quality of finished product 
like it i like it the shaped tongs help in gripping heavier things as opposed to a smooth tong end it was worth the purchase 
works perfectly i use it over my bedsheets to keep them clean and dry when my slobbery lab uses my bed as hers works just great stays put even over a quilt and washes well 
great deal and very handy i bought one set of these and was so impressed i bought a second set the quality of the ramekins is great and the price is terrific i use them in the kitchen and also for sorting my beading supplies you really can t have too many of these as they are so handy 
peaceful kitties this product really works ! i have cats and fighting was inevitable my only complaint is that the product barely lasts a month it s rather expensive but i love having a peaceful home i have high ceilings and that may be part of why i have to replace these often another multi cat person i know says these last about to weeks for her i intend to continue using this product as along as i have a lot of cats 
inch stainless steel open skillet this skillet is of high quality stainless steel and i am completely satisfied with it and the prompt delivery 
frother review i had a rechargable frother that i purchased from williams and sonoma ws and am quite pleased with it my friend since who lives in hartford ct liked it so i offered to send her so she could buy one at w s for her birthday w s no longer carries it i purchased it on amazon for her and had it mailed to her she is delighted with it my only displeasure was that i could not get free shipping for an item costing over because a seller other than amazon 
zojirushi air pot i have been using the zojirushi air pot to store hot green tea it looks sleek and beautiful on a table in my husband s antique shop and it keeps the tea hot and flavorful all day i had been been worried that it might leak or drip after pouring but this has not been a problem it is quite easy to clean as well 
a good product the quality is pretty good but the actual color is much brighter than it is shown on the website 
huge cup holds alot and keeps them warm ! fits in my car cup holder as well where not much else does 
analon rocks i ve had the eight piece set for a year and a half now and this pan sold without the lid for about two years they re all good quality heavyweight cookware and the non stick works like a charm i ve not had a single problem with sticking and the interior remains scratch freei wonder if the people who complain about scratches are storing their pans stacked inside of each other this can lead to scratching one easy solution is to place a paper towel between pans when stacking no it s not dishwasher safe but you really don t need to put it in the dishwasher ! it doesn t fit in my sink either but you don t need to soak it the food slides right off and it takes less than two minutes to wash the pan i highly recommend any of the analon classic cookware 
use no other knives i have owned my set of miracle blade iii knives for over years now and they have never dulled ! i use one of the smaller knives as a utility knife in the kitchen to open both packages and to cut small vegetables and the other knives for their designed purpose when i go to someone else s house it is still so frustrating to use their knives which do not perform as well as my own ! a must for anyone who cooks ! i have given an extra knife i had as a gift ! 
little small i have a hard time giving this three stars because it deserves more since i just have no concept of how much an ounce is i thought ounces would be enough to be able to play around with the milk for latte art on my drinks but it helps if you have enough milk for the drink personally i would upgrade to the bigger pitcher unless you only drink true doppio macchiato s the drinks in the tiny cups i am a starbucks barista and know when i see a quality product and this definately meets my standards good product just stupid buyer 
exactly what i wanted i am very pleased with my new nordic ware popper i am the only one in my household who likes popcorn so hate to make the large microwave bags or pay the inflated price for the little ones i m also on weight watchers so need to limit quantity and fat i put in a few tablespoons spray with parkay spray butter add a little salt and have a delicious low point snack in minutes at the fraction of the cost of individual micro pop bags the bowl gets a little hot but i read that in other reviews before i ordered it so i always make sure i have a pot holder thanks for a great product 
this coat rack is awesome i love this item i bought and it arrived in a timely fashion thank 
beautiful but definitely focuses the flavor and aroma of the finest hermitage shiraz etc but the the glasses do not feel as delicate and refined as my other sommelier series do maybe because they are hand made i compared the ones i bought on amazon to another set at a local store the glasses at the store felt lighter otherwise the glasses are excellent ! go figure oh and there was a small bubble on one of the glasses not a distraction after filled with wine but a glass ! 
chef recommends ! great professional quality knives at a reasonable cost okay so i m not a chef but more of a seinfeld fan i am an amatuer who wanted to have a decent set of knives and i picked these out after quite a bit of searching a real chef will tell you to get the knife that feels right to you alton brown recommends that you handle the knives before you buy since you won t use an uncomfortable unergonomic one even if it looked awesome before you bought these have a very solid handle riveted to a full tang of high quality steel the top of the blades are all thicker than many of the other brands and even other models from the henckels brand they felt good to me they are perfectly balanced and heavy in the hand they feel substantial when you pick them up they didn t seem to be as sharp as i expected from such a set of knives but regular use of the included sharpening steel improved on my impression of this one detractor is that most burgeoning young chefs have never used a steel or hone and they don t include instructions in the set for this bad idea ! i have since found instructions on the web from henckels themselves even when i do it properly and take my time they are simply amazing leaving out instructions was bad form maybe mine was missing dishwashers are not recommended as bouncing around can nick the blade i have a plastic basket and i keep planning on putting them in there to see how fare but i can t bring myself to do it handwashing is a pain but i know they will last that way im going to chalk up the sharpness to my own unskilled hands and i m pretty sure that goes for many others even the german made ones would get dull without proper steel use they are absolutely top notch quality at an amazing price they hold their edge very well when you use the steel avoid bone and glass surface cutting boards the only thing i wish is that i could toss them in the dishwasher but like quality stainless pans you don t want to subject them to the heat caustic detergent and banging dont hesitate to buy these knives maybe you could use them to whip up some clams casino hmmm tastes funky 
great upgrade from a mop having a whole house sq ft of tiled floor with area rugs we spent a lot of time mopping this little cleaner makes it so much easier and cleans so much better ! the first time it was kind of eye opening seeing the improvement in appearance of the tile and the dirt on the head covers used it pulls easily and has a fairly long electrical cord be sure to get additional terry cloth covers for the head if you have a large area to cleans or have kids and pets running across your floors or it is easy to make head covers from old towels cut to the same size the only problem we have had is the button you push to get continuous steam seems to pop out too easily making it necessary to keep your finger on the switch to keep the steam coming 
simple and effective i ve had this model or something similar for about the past years and love it i inadvertently burnt out the motor on the first one by trying to chop some cheese using the food processor attachment don t keep the motor going if the blade stops spinning because the food is too tough ! shake it up or do less food at a time and try again this is the only blender i have i mostly use it for smoothies and love having something small and efficient that gets the job done no big hunk of blender sitting around and fewer materials needed to make and ship it mixes stuff right in the container you want it in avoiding more mess and cleanup and when you re done the mixing end twists off for easy washing nice 
i ve used better but this is good for the price this is good for spot cleaning crumbs and small areas obviously it cannot replace a vacuum it does come apart a little too easy but this happens when my sons use it 
best krumkake baker ever after spending many years using a manual cast iron stove top krumkake baker shoulder arthritis made it impossible i actually dreaded the season and the krumkake i always made to give as gifts with my new electric krumkake baker i just made a batch in only hour usually took hours on the stove no burned fingers and no shoulder arthitic problem ! and my very first krumkake turned out perfectly it usually took me about to get it right with my stove top system thanks for a terrific product and recipe i ll use it all year not only at christmastime 
excellent quality i received my roaster within days of ordering it was excellent quality and made of commercial grade aluminum with a thick bottom on the pan the lid fit tightly and allowed the food to cook properly with no loss of moisture i would highly recommend this product thanks amazon 
mortar and pestle my daughter suddenly decided she wanted a mortar and pestle she s mad keen on cooking and watches the cookery channel non stop i couldn t even spell it ! after looking around the local mall we came home and went to good old standby amazon great selection everything imaginable bought this one it arrived quickly and it s perfect it s still sitting on the counter in the kitchen full of crushed pepper corns she never puts anything away 
great for cats who insist running water i purchased a waterfall style fountain for my cat it was horrible on the highest setting it barely made a tiny stream i picked up this fountain here and my cat loves it ! instead of leaving a water faucet on for her to drink from all the time she is quite happy with this its quiet and even the lowest setting and still has a potent stream of water if you have a cat who demands fresh water from the faucet i know i m not the only one with a cat like this buy this fountain you won t have to put up with the turn the faucet on for meee kitty dance ever again 
excellent product this sharpener is very easy to use and does a fantastic job of sharpening both my wusthorf knives and my scissors 
awesome travel mug it s a nice size cup that does a great job insulating cool sliding lid design that is convenient my only complaint would be that it s not spill proof but the lid holds well enough to stir my coffee by shaking and hey they never said it was spill proof the handle is comfy and it still fits in my cup holders audi it s has a nice lip to drink from and even the owner of the gourmet coffee store i frequent asked me what kind it was with a jealous look in her eye very sharp looking the lid screws on for both lefty and righty use you can pour coffee right up to the top threads i usually take the lid off when i get to work and the smooth metal lip is still very comfy however you get dribbles on the metal i found mine on closeout at target for and now i m going to pay for another one yeah i like it alot as an older seasoned caffeine addict i have gone through my share of various travel mugs and i m getting a second one of these before they stop making them eh maybe the wife can borrow it friends don t let friends go to starbucks 
better than five stars i believe if you re serious about cooking you should own great cookware and excellent knives i finally stepped up and got excellent knives for those who haven t heard the hype shun is one of the most respected knife brands in the world check them out on the web at kershawknives comgreat features of the entire line include these cool d shaped handles that fit your hand better every shun classic knife is made in a right and left handed version chefsresourcecom for lefties the handles are made of wood and are specially treated so they are diswasher safe the steel used for the blades is harder than what you would find in most other knives the knives are extremely sharp one thing to note about asian knives is that they must be sharpened at a different angle degrees vs degrees for german knives the shun steel takes the guesswork out of getting the angle correct because of the flat edge on one side of the metal disc below the handle inch slicing this is an impressive knife it s sleek and sharp like the rest of its siblings i know the granton edge is supposed to reduce drag but i m not certain this is a necessity for a knife i use three times a year there is a version without the grantons that s a few dollars cheaper this is an expensive but lifetime investment i encourage you to visit stores and feel the knives in your hand to make sure you are comfortable with them for more info on shun check out alton brown s website for ratings on various brands and types of knives check out cooksillustrated coms equipment ratings shun is probably the best kitchen purchase i ve made and the one i m most proud of 
great littke heater if you want a heater for a small space this is the one you want i have a back pantry and laundry area about x that gets quite cold in the winter this little heater does the trick the first time i put it out i cranked it on high and after a few hours i had to lower the temperature and put it on a lower setting be warned that there is a slight odor when you first plug this unit in the directions will warn you if you read them it dissipates after a few hours this is natural with all heating elements it is very similar to what happens when you buy your first slow cooker this is the first unit i have owned for the house i have a second unit in my barn i like the feel of radiator heat there is no dry air or ozone smell that occurs like when you purchase a ceramic heater i highly recomend this unit 
a very very good big knife this is the knife i find myself reaching for most often while working in my kitchen why it feels right in the hand it is well ballanced and the grip fits my admitedly beefy hands quite well the excellent ballance makes it feel like a smaller knife in my hand that is to say i have no touble using it even for semi precission tasks this makes it very versitile and i don t find myself switching knives for every task i find that a few passes across the diamond steel brings the blade up to razor sharp once honed on the diamond steel i can prepare meals for hours with only the occasional pass across the diamond steel to maintain the edge all this said i will say that the high carbon content of the henckels knife makes the blade quite hard and if you let the edge go entirely you will need to find a professional to return the knife to razor sharpness as doing it yourself is very difficult a side note i do not use a regular steel with any or my knives they are not really intended to sharpen a knife but rather to straighten the edge the diamond steel will give thes knife back its edge and does so quickly and rather gently at that 
silicone baking sheet it s great but i realized i can t cover my non stick pan with it and broil because it can t have direct flame other than that it s great 
purina cat chow great product too bad the shipping cost as much as the produc 
z garment rack commercial grade this rack was very easy to assemble the unit is very stable and moves very easy with the wheels it will hold lots of clothes and is not under any strain to do so i would recommend this to anyone needing additional hanging space 
the only cat toy i ve ever needed i bought one of these at a cat show about years ago and have never regretted it this thing absolutely memerizes my kitties and this is an update i bought a replacement set of feathers and within a week my cats had torn them out of the holder i guess the quality went down 
yet another wonderful knife from henckels henckels knives are quality you can tell just by the feel of their knives this line is also weighty and balance just right in you hands while i like henckels pro line slightly better because of the fit of those handles in my hands you can t go wrong with this knife 
happy time for families the waffler works great effective for those who multi task the bell reminds me when to add batter or when i must remove a waffle the box mixes come out o k but more tough the yeast recipe tastes yeasty i recommend a recipe with whipped whites lemon juice and cornstarch for lightness freeze well add a little more sugar and vanilla for kid friendly waffles a great way to wake up kids in the morning on a busy day 
great item and great value this set is attractive and well made a great value for the money ! the crackers are nice and sturdy and i m confident that they will stand up to years of hard use i am back to order additional sets as gifts for my seafood loving friends 
great vacuum i like everything about this vacuum cleaner the tools fit nicely in the body of the cleaner it is easy to wheel around and the cord retracts you can hang the main attachment on the body and store easily so far it has certainly lived up to all the vacuuming tasks and would not hesitate to recommend it esp to those with hard wood floors 
just what i needed my stove hood was getting darker and voila ! it s bright again easy to install and minimally packaged 
convenient tight lock the container is easy to open and close but has a very secure seal to keep out any problem areas we have seen containers fare less thanwell going through hurricanes and the aftermath mold bug infestations but this comes through with a shining star 
saved our cat from drowning in our toilet didn t take too long to put together way cheaper than the pet stores and now we don t have to keep putting the toilet lid down as our cat loves fresh flowing water 
great knife so sharp i almost cut my cutting board in half love it ! 
best amazon purchase ever ! best vacuum ever i ve had all types of vacuums from the dirt devils to bissel to beam to electrolux to kirby this by far is my favorite ! my only complaint is that the dirt cup is too small granted i should vacuum more often dont buy this vacuum if you don t like emptying dirt cups of bagless vacuums you want to vacuum hardwood you want to vacuum throw rugs what i love about it the suction control very powerful good for steps car medium weight great on longer carpet fibers cord recoil is easy just does a great job some say it is heavy it isn t a super light weight nor is it very heavy i carry it as i vacuum the steps and i ordered it on a friday which i received a great bargain ! check it out 
great canisters i love these canisters they are pleasing to the eye easy to get into and different enough to feel unique 
ss skimmer good kitchen tool but the handle is a bit too long it should be shorter 
rather nice glasses these are very functional and versatile glasses i use them quite often 
beats the dirt method i got one of these for my cats who love their drinkwell fountain and they now love the cat grass addition it didn t last really long just a few weeks before they d eaten it all and it stopped growing the roots take over about half the bowl but the cats didn t seem to mind i love this for the wintertime when the cat grass i grow outside dies for the year 
great smushy pillows i bought two of these pillows i just love feather pillows the last set i bought were to crunchy and not soft enough for me these pillows are just right some support and softness i like the pillow to envelope my head when i lay on them these do i will certainly buy more the the pillow case is just so elegant 
beautifully manufactured and useful this little steamer is perfect for small servings and between uses adds a nice decorative touch to the kitchen countertop 
daryl our son daughter inlaw gave us this model for christmas in we love it in we gave them this same model 
a gift from grandma the pillow it is not the normal x pound dogbones neckbones pillow it took two fedex men to carry the box to the door ! i sent it as a gift for my mo old granddaughter to cuddle with in her crib because she liked my regular one but my daughter is afraid this would smother her ! look at her laying beside it ! my son inlaw can t cuddle with it because it s so big and orange ! their lb black lab runs the other direction every time she sees it ! my kids thought i flipped out and were going to have to hide it until i came to visit ! we ll figure out what to do with it when we stop rolling on the floor laughing ! hint if the description states six pounds it s a dinosaurbones neckbones 
handier than a collander no longer dreading making pasta spaghetti fits in the pot without breaking and the water can be drained out after cooking right into the main pot great ! however do not overfill the water in the pot or it can boil over coming out the sides between the pot and the insert 
the best measuring cup if you like a product that is light weight sturdy and aesthetically pleasing then this is the measuring cup for you the difference in use between this item and the normal pyrex is is quite pronounced it pours better and handles better because it is so lightweight you also won t spill things as readily because there is enough sloshroom allowed after you fill it to the top about another cup just don t bang it around it won t take as much abuse as the pyrex but that is a small price to pay 
black pitcher it does function well hmmmmm kinda like a pitcher and looks great as an accent with my black appliances 
grandma had one and now so do i it s fun for making milkshakes quickly and does blend quite evenly if you manually do the up n down with the drink cup very easy to clean up after use for as frequently as i use it it s mostly a nice looking decoration so i can t personally testify to its effectiveness as a daily use appliance but i do like it for its nostalgic appearance and has thus far worked like a dream when i wanted it to over the course of two years 
rockies imperial goose down excellent comforter and really nice and warm sorry i did not buy it last winter 
well above stars the best interactive toy available stars my pug loves this toy better than all the rest of this kind he jumps to pull the beas out of the hive he squeaks the beas perhaps it is the contrast of the black band and the shape of the bea head he went crazy for this toy and got exercise with it it is better to play with you dog and hold the hive and have them pull the beas out by their heads he likes the wing detail for chewing on this toy gives exercise i am so glad i tried it he plays with the hegehog on his own those are the best toys the squirels from the hide a squirel are fun but the game holder is not something he was really excited about these interactive toys are great i have never seen such excitement and tail wagging he hardly ever wags his tail and he did with this toy and the jumping is great exercise this one is the best it is well worth for a dog who loves to play i get him to stop destroying the house as much with these toys 
shun knives are beautiful elegant and the sharpest around shun knives are beautiful creations period since i m asian i love the tradition look and feel of this japanese knife i love the beauty of the blade and the dark polished pakkawood handle the unique dshaped wood handles are preferable the shape fits my hand perfectly and the wood does not get slippery when wet providing a very secure hold the steel is of utmost quality and sharpness do not put this blade into any old electric knife sharpener ! electric knife sharpeners are made to put one angle on any blade these blades come with a degree angle and you don t want to be changing that angle there are electric knife sharpeners that can sharpen these knives but you ll have to do some research and find out which ones can be a fit with these knives i prefer to hone with a sharpening steel and manually sharpen with a stone if necessary and i don t see it being necessary to touch it to a stone any time soon the blade is sharp straight off the factory and as alton brown says it s the sharpest straight out of the factory edge as he s ever seen these knives are more expensive than most but i think it s definitely worth it to have the sharpest most beautiful knife around it s no contest if you are on a budget build your collection slowly it s been said that there are only knives that are the absolute basics for any kitchen a chef s knife or some kind of similar large ish chef s knife a paring knife and a long serrated blade for cutting bread and larger items i would add a thin utility knife and a boning knife to that list next then i would add those inbetween sizes as i get more money flow in now if you re buying a whole set like this you ll get it all in one shot and it becomes a better deal than pieceing your collection together one byoneif you plan on spending any time in the kitchen good kitchen knives are a definite must preparation is the bulk of cooking and when you have good knives it cuts down on the danger of cutting yourself it adds pleasure to the work and it cuts down on prep time knives are also a very personal choice and it s best to at least go to a store and try it out for yourself first shun knives are designed by the japanese so remember it s designed for small hands this makes it fit most women s hands perfectly but i ve heard of guys with larger hands not like it so much and going back to the german knives so definitely try it out it s a personal thing it needs to fit you why spend so much money on a knife well if you spend a lot of time in the kitchen and you almost always have to bust out a knife to prep a meal from scratch why not use the best why spend that time with items that you love and brings you pleasure to use many times it s the small things that brings us the most pleasure in life and i consider my shun knives as one of those things having something so beautiful and yet so sharp and perfect it makes my time cooking just that much more enjoyable another good thing to know is that although the shun knives are usually offered for right handers you can get these knives for left handers you just need to find the guys who stock and sell those ones as they are less known and less common 
great gift i bought two of the margaritaville machines for co workers they have been raving about it ever since in one case it has became a permanent appliance sitting on top of the kitchen counter right next to the toaster i havn t experienced it yet but my co workers are having blast making all types of frozen drinks 
i like it crunchy this is a great pan to make oven goodies frozen packaged french fries chicken nuggets tenders fish sticks breaded mushrooms cheese sticks jalapeno poppers etc bake up nice and crispy and crunchy ! the holes in the bottom of the pan make hot oven air circulate up underneath the pieces the holes sit below raised ridges that hold the food up so some fat can drain off the food doesn t sit flat on the metal and turn mushy on one end there is a pouring lip so putting the food onto a plate is easy this is a fantastic pan if you like it crispy and crunchy 
it works i used the zorb in high traffic area it removes dirt and the carpet looks new after zorb cleaning i applies twice a year on the high traffic area like the stair and it keeps the high traffic area as good as the rest of the carpet 
good product a multi purpose bucket can be used for drinks or flowers the reasonfor the four stars is that it took quite a while to come and arrivedtoo late for the occasion needed 
a must have for tea drinkers i switched from coffee to tea a few months ago purchased this unit and am completely happy with it i can t recommend it highly enough it s well made ergonomic well thought out and a joy to use the japanese think of everything a japanese friend of mine told me that homes in japan almost always have one of these units or one like it now that i drink only tea i can understand why the three temperature settings well four if you count boiling are perfect is good for herbal teas tissanes and also the increasingly popular and wonderful rooibos that s also a good temperature for ramen oatmeal etc is good for black tea and also oolong and is good for green tea or white tea now you can make gourmet tea properly with no muss and no fuss just get yourself some gourmet loose tea herbal tea or rooibos all available from garrett adagio or teavana and a convenient brewer like ingenuitea from adagio teavana also makes a good one that might be slightly better in quality and you will be good togo your taste buds will thank you and so will your body the health benefits of green tea and oolong are well known and also rooibos has times the antioxidants of green tea and no caffeine my blood pressure has dropped points with less caffeine compared to caffeine in coffee black tea oolong green white rooibos and herbal buy a zojirushi ! you won t be disappointed 
i hate spiders the vacuum works great it would be perfect if the bugs didn t need to get removed from the part where they are zapped i would also make the top part a little softer to get a tighter fit in corners i have tried everything and this is the best product i have found 
good speakers great warranty short and sweat speakers sound very good as with any pair of bose speakers not the most bass or treble but lots of mids i m sure there are better less exspensive speakers for outside but i ve not found any with a year warrany and that s the only reason i bought them 
best slow cooker i love this item ! i used it a couple of times already and the chicken was the best that i ever had ! i couldn t believe that it does everything that it says it does ! the food is tender flavorful even the next day ! this is the best thing i have added to my kitchen in years 
great product i received this as a gift years ago since then i have canned just about everything you can imagine in it the only complaint i have is that the outside spots up and the inside stains but i guess it s from all the use i would definitely buy another one of these but i think mine will last for years 
great crock pot i like this crock pot i haven t used the little one much but i m sure it will come in handy next time i m serving a warm cheesy dip or melted chocolate i love that the lid is clear so you can see what s going on in there the keep warm feature is nice too esp if mealtime is later than you planned something kind of odd is that after you wash the crock pot and it dries there s always a white residue on it i m not sure what that s all about but it s a good crock pot 
the perfect wok i highly recommend this wok it is super light but very strong it comes unseasoned but it was easy to season as it was so light once seasoned it became a deep coppery color and is slowly getting darker it cooks beautifully very quickly and the vegetables stay crisp and delicious originally i wanted a wok with a longer handle thinking this would make it easier to move suprisingly the handles do not usually get very hot and i haven t really had any trouble holding it when cooking or picking it up cleaning it easy once seasoned nothing sticks and even when i leave it unwashed overnight it cleans quickly just using cold water and one of those plastic covered sponges i definitely recommend getting the wok ring this makes the wok far more stable otherwise this is the perfect wok it is light strong cast iron and is a pleasure to cook with 
fiskar craft crate scrapbook organizer apparently the previous rater is not a very organized person i find this catty perfect for travel to scrapbook parties and more if you are a cuttered kind of person this in not for you smart crafter 
very good use it is nice and pretty good to use food and liquid it is very easy to take it off i am satisfied with the product 
it works perfectly among many scales that i looked at before i got this one cuisinart was one of the smallest and it fits on our counter without taking too much space the weighting tray is removable and easy to clean so far so good 
great product this product is exactly what i thought it would be ive been looking for a wheeled hamper for a long time now so i was very happy to find this 
pretty serving tray pretty serving tray my only complaint is that i thought it might be a bit taller but it will still do it s job at a buffet table very pretty and great for the price the glass is nice and thick and the line of products is beautiful i do see the handle becoming a problem after constant use but who uses these things constantly my problem i mean the silver coming off still recommend it you won t regret it 
great for grinding pepper i liked it a lot better than i thought i would the plastic feels nice and smooth and it grinds well it doesn t have a cheap plastic gonna breaksoon feel after all it s made in germany not china i like that it stands upright and has a cap unlike a lot of other grinders that would leave peppper on the table 
perfect addition i bought this wine rack for my husband for father s day it arrived in less than a week it included extra hardware and the assembly was easy i had it put together and loaded before he came home from work it looks great with our existing dining room furniture i would definately recommend this item the only drawback is that it only holds wine glasses from the top 
elegant and versatile these glasses are a lovely elegant shape gorgeous and appropriate for champagne and the bit of extra width makes them suitable for white wine too they come in a box individually wrapped in tissue they are reasonably priced for a set of six and make a great gift 
great product great knife love the unibody and is very sharp 
sharp r js cubic foot grill convection microwave silver great all around microwave for singles the only thing it does not do well is microwave popcorn 
better than original carafe after the handle broke off the carafe that came with our krups aromacontrol after about years of use perhaps several times a week i found this one and ordered it my belief is that cleaning the original carafe in a dishwasher is what caused the handle to come off however i am perturbed that i had to go to the trouble of replacing it one would think the engineers would consider the heat of a dishwasher when choosing the plastic components i am not entirely sure but it is possible that the plastic abs became too brittle with oxidation and simply fractured i searched on the internet and found this to be a very common problem which is at the same time comforting and annoying upon receiving this carafe i was disappointed due to the lightweight feel of it i prefer a certain heft and i assumed that the lack of this in the new unit means that it is cheaply made however this has proved not to be the case moreover the decreased weight is actually something of a blessing further i think they removed some of the threads around the neck of the carafe inside on this model the advantage of this is that the coffee pours better a tighter stream not a wide cascading waterfall like the original carafe however i it seems to make screwing the top on more difficult in all it is superior to the original however i am not washing the carafe in the dishwasher for fear of the handle coming off i assume that they have fixed this problem in this model however i cannot be sure of this i also must say that it is a tad over priced and that perhaps might be a more reasonable price the only reason i did not get a new coffee maker is that the aromacontrol works well and makes good coffee i use illy 
the best there is if you love pizza then you definitely need this cutter it is by far the nicest and the heaviest one that i ve ever had i have always had one of those flimsy wooden ones that cut nothing until i received this one finally ! the blade cuts through anything including pies and quiche i particularly like the fact that it comes with a blade cover a definite must in a household with little ones great item 
attractive and functional this is a clever design that really works it heats up quickly and you can simply lift the kettle and use it anywhere without dragging the cord around the on off knob seems a bit fragile but i ve been using this thing times per day for a couple of months and i m quite happy with it i recently noticed some salty crystals in the bottom of my coffee cup i found that the mineral deposits that usually crud up heating elements simply sit on the bottom of this kettle they don t stick to the metal they just pile up no boiling vinegar required just wipe it out occasionally and it is pristine 
great product expensive but worth it my cat only drinks from water thats running siamese geez he wasnt peachy with it at first but after about a day or so he realised that i wasnt going to give him water from the sink anymore and switched but i had to keep up with the reinforcement of not giving him water from the bathroom sink when he wanted to get water and meowed i would take him over to the waterfall and petting him lovingly i put the fountain in a seclueded corner so nothing is able to distract him or sneak up or frighten him 
great blender this is a great blender that is easy to care for and fun to use it does a fine job of blending ingredients including ice to the consistency that you desire the only negative thus far is the fact that it doesn t swirl the contents from top to bottom as i d like perhaps i have unrealistic expectations 
helpful for arthritis these treats have been great for our large breed older dog who has developed arthritis in his hips they re also one of the few glucosamine treats that don t make him sick 
works good just small i really like this kettle i ve had it a month and it boils water fast i like that the kettle is self contained with nothing to contaminate the water and that i can take the kettle off the base without a cord following me around my only complaint is that i wish it was bigger with my big mugs for coffee or tea it only fills a couple at a time 
peace of mind i dont do a lot of bread making but i am an avid meat smoker and griller the taylor classic roast yeast thermometer has taken the stress out of preparing a feast for my guests i have tried more expensive thermometers but some read out an obvious wrong temperature and others are very difficult to read the taylor thermometer solves both problems ! whether you do most of your cooking outdoors or in your kitchen this thermometer will give you peace of mind well worth the price and ships fast 
excellent value i want to start off by saying that any review is relative to the consumers past experience before getting this knife i was working from a cheap knife set so i won t profess that my opinion is going to be relevant when compared to other high quality knives for me the price was great and after using it i really appreciate how crappy the knives in my old set are it s amazing how much more enjoyable cooking is when you have quality tools so if you re upgrading from a crappy set of knives you won t be disappointed if you already have a good set of knives and you re looking to replace one of them with this please read another review 
wmf coffee press aaa this press lives up to it s marketing description my only concern is how to replace the glass insert i tried a generic replacement and although it fit okay the pouring lip is narrower than the original and leaks at the edges how do i get an original glass replacement 
a must have for your puppy this washable cedar bedding fits in the pet gear home n go soft sided pet crate and the manufacturers really should have included it with the crate don t buy the crate without also purchasing this necessary padding the combo makes a great starter home for your new puppy 
i love love love this french oven this is one of the best items to have in your kitchen it means pot cooking when you re making stews soups or casseroles from scratch the finish is fabulous and it stays that way it s pretty enough to serve from at the table this size is great for anything up to a moderate sized chicken or pot roast it heats evenly and retains the heat well i love love love this french oven i m going to aim toward filling my kitchen with le creuset from now on 
hamilton beach amazon asked me to review the replacement filter so i thought i d go ahead and make some comments about the air cleaner itself prior to buying the air cleaner must have been almost years ago i d wake up most mornings with a runny nose since running this overnight for the past years i very rarely ever have any stuffiness or runniness in the mornings in fact if someone shuts it off during the night my wife and i both notice the difference in the air in the house i recommend this any time someone tells me about their allergies it is one of the highest value purchases i have made eve 
stoneware casserole this is a high fired stoneware casserole its non porous enamel is same as on iron cast pots by le creuset and it looks great because it is stoneware it can be put in a freezer and then microwaved though it s excellent for baking and can be brought to the table for serving as well i give it only four stars because it s not unique in its baking qualities and i can get same results in corning casserole for a fraction of a price as for cast iron dutch ovens i didn t find substitutes so far 
love them these spoons are so nice the strength is a nice change from all those wooded spoons i ve used over the years the red color is perfect for my kitchen too my wooden spoons are now in the trash 
the best ever the thread count is excellent on these egyptian cotton sheets really something worth considering its like sleeping on clouds in heaven in the sky where god lives 
the awesome euro cuisine ym yogurt maker this yogurt maker is wonderful ! easy to follow directions and all the yogurt i ve made has been sooooooo much better than store bought i use organic milk and the yogurt starter that euro recommended and it turns out perfectly every time i cant keep enough made ! you definitely wont regret buying this machine get some extra jars so you can do a batch when the other is halfway used so you dont run out 
i loved it i was glad to see the unit arrived without damage despite poor packaging supplied by the manufacturer the unit works great ! 
num num num num num the perfect cookie jar in fact we bought a few more and now keep rice and flour in them too i sweat this makes cookies taste better 
a great saucepan despite what others have written about a degradation in all clad quality i have not seen any problems whatsoever this pan is a staple in my kitchen since i purchsed it last summer i like it s deep profile which is useful for sauteing onions or garlic and then putting the rest of the ingredients right into the pan a great addition 
my ideal fry pan i recently upgraded my range from a gas model to an electric smooth surface cooktop which i love i soon realized that a lot of my old cheaper cookware which had worked just fine on my old stove didn t work as well on my new one because of the nature of the design of this type of cooktop the heat transfers to the cookware instead of the direct heat of conventional cooking bottom line is that your cookware needs to sit flat in order to perform well mine didn t i bought this set because i wanted things heavyduty cookware to work with my new cooktop a non stick finish in the fry pan only but stainless steel in the pots a strainer built into the lids and seethrough clear lids this is the only cookware i ve found that met all of my criteria i can tell a big difference between the new cookware and the old 
great quality and size my mom asked for one of these to replace some carafe she had broken that came from william sonoma the one from william sonoma seemed grossly overpriced to me so i bought this one based on reviews from others my mom liked it even better than her old one ! i bought one for myself at the same time and enjoyed serving tea to guests in it it s not too big to be too heavy but it holds enough tea for people perfect 
pizza blade very nice product to use for pizza but i m going to use mine to transfer wedding size cake pans from the oven to the cooling racks on my kitchen s island ! the large handle makes lifting the heavy pans much easier and safer than reaching way into the interior of a hot oven with your arms 
great bowls we are very particular about bowls but i have to say these are fantastic they actually hold a lot and look great the only downside is that they are a little heavy i am very happy with my purchase and plan on buying more 
a quality product i did a great deal of research on the internet before buying an automatic pasta maker i couldn t spend a fortune but i wanted the best quality machine i could afford i read too many reports of broken plastic extrusion discs motors that burned out etc i learned that the simac delonghi and lello products were all related so the quality of the older simac brand seemed to be carried on in the newer delonghi and lello brands i liked their metal extrusion discs and the durability of them i felt a lb capacity was ideal i bought this one i was not disappointed i had read a great deal on the internet that the trickiest part is getting the dough consistency right most if not all of the negative reviews of all pasta machines center around this problem when trying to decide which machine to buy i do not recommend being influenced by reviews that focus entirely on this issue that complaint is all about user error and has nothing to do with the quality or reliability of the machine experienced makers of home made pasta need to understand that the dough will need to be a different consistency in this machine than when done the manual way i measured carefully and read the machine instructions very carefully they bend over backwards to help you with this and i didn t have any trouble getting pasta dough to extrude i found that a lb capacity is more than i needed for a family of i also felt that having metal extrusion discs is valuable in that when you trim the dough as it extrudes you really run your knife against that metal a lot in order to help get a clean cut i can imagine a plastic disc would wear considerably faster under those circumstances you literally slice and slice hundreds of times for the smaller pastas like elbows and such i would highly recommend this machine i was impressed by its quality and usefulness you will not regret your purchase with this one 
wonderful alternative to plastic containers i bought two sets containers of these about months ago and i absolutely love them the shallow dimensions make them equally ideal for casseroles and cuts of meat and their smaller size a nice cups helps with portion control they re much more durable than plastic lunch containers and they can be reheated over and over without any signs of wear i highly recommend these i ll never go back to plastic 
happy chopper ! review applies to both i completely agree with sobai s january th review i looked at the furi knives when shopping locally two months ago but my husband encouraged me to purchase a set of wusthof classic knives instead while i love the wusthofs i reach for my furis just as often i received the furi knife as a christmas gift and was so pleased with the product that i ordered the a week later both knives were incredibly sharp right out of the package i give them a couple of swipes down a steel before each use and they re holding an edge beautifully like sobai i also like the orange silicone grip did someone actually call it plastic i have small hands and find the grip to be ergonomic safe and comfortable the knife remains secure in my hand even when cutting chicken ! the orange color stands out in my block making it easy to find the desired knife quickly besides nothing like a little harley davidson orange to brighten up the kitchen knives are a matter of personal preference i m pretty picky and have found the furis to be a quality product my recommendation go to a local knife shop and hold a lot of different knives in your hand pay attention to how each feels and imagine how your hand would feel after cutting a mountain of veggies the best knife in the world for one person may not be the best choice for another happy chopping 
more than adequate for the price i was downsizing when i purchased this microwave both in size and in heat content my biggest satisfaction with this product was that it fit the small space that had been created in my kitchen cabinet design for a microwave my second goal had been to have an all white product which is hard to find in today s black or stainless appliance kitchens i have no complaints about the heating quality or the control choices my only reminder of a lesser product is that the door makes the sound a metal door will make when it is opened or closed but this product is more than adequate for the price 
revere ware skillet revere ware non stick skillets are excellent products ! they re very durable and have lasted longer than any two other brands put together i would highly recommend their line which you apparently can buy only online now 
fits my needs to a tee ! buy it i got this pot to replace an old quart teflon lined aluminum pot of similar shape but with plastic handles which kept it from the oven without extraordinary measures the old pot simply did not heat up very quickly or evenly and it s dark interior made it more difficult to see what was going on with braises or pasta cooking so i was often lugging out my quart le creuset dutch oven when the smaller lighter pot would be the perfect size but for the plastic handles i have used it a few times since receiving it and it meets every expectation even outperforming a similarly sized quart calphalon pan which was my old favorite when i bunked with a gas range this is an incredibly uselfu size and shape and worth the cost if you cook a lot highly recommended 
irobot roomba replacement filters my roomba is still going strong since i recieved it as a christmas gift i strongly recommend getting the replacement filters and changing them as directed to get the best out of your irobot the filters are easy to install and work great 
picky baby food eater while my son is still picky about the consistency of baby food he does eat it which is great in addition i will also say this is a very easy to clean use and store baby food grinder 
excellent size for family meals about a month ago a friend gave me her gf tenth anniversary grill because she said she had no room for it in her kitchen in return i grilled up some home made sausage and veggies and had her and her family over for a great supper ! i really love this grill even though it s got a big surface area it s no trouble for me to either take it out or put it away and it cleans really easily my tip for cleaning is to rub the grilling plates with damp paper towels while the grill is still fairly warm the charred stuff wipes right off i wish this large grill had interchangeable plates for griddling and making waffles like the smaller g version does just imagine the big breakfasts you could serve up with this baby ! i do suppose extra plates would make this grill too hard to manage though given its size bottom line i d highly recommend this grill especially if you re using it for a family of four or more 
very comfortable i have had this for almost a month now and i am very impressed with the extra comfort and cushion this has added to the bed i was a little concerned that it might flatten out and lose its padding but so far it feels the same as it did new very happy with this purchase and i ordered a second one 
just right makes short work of much grating the best with which i ve ever worked 
versatile starter piece as seems the case with some other reviewers this was my first piece of le creuset it s wonderful for braising and easy to maintain it has all of the benefits of uncoated cast iron with an easy toclean enamel coating while heavy it is not unwieldy it was my favorite piece until the next piece of course 
works quite well this wine pourer works quite well my wife and i have enjoyed how nicely it pours and that it doesn t seem to drip apparently as a bonus it also is supposed to aerate the wine i m not quite sure of the extent of this talent but it does seem to pour well hence the clever name one note to pour nicely it does lessen the pouring flow rate it s not bad for small tonormal sized social gatherings but for large parties where your goal is to get large amounts of wine in lots of glasses in a short time there is a limiting factor with this pourer for most people ourselves included this little do dad does seem to pour effectively without the wine drip 
sometimes less is more i ve had other digital thermometers with pre programmed temperatures that were just confusing to use finding the preferred temperature for any meat or poultry item is such a simple matter any decent cookbook will have them many recipes specify and there are always the many online resources that i much prefer the straightforward approach here of just inserting the probe and checking the display occasionally i also love the little gadget that allows you to attach it to a saucepan for candies and other liquids that need careful timing temperature wise i happily threw out my old candy thermometer after using this one it s more accurate and easier to read highly recommend 
most amazing this is probably the best knife i have ever owned never dull and always a smooth cutting experience this knife has never let me down before owning this knife i didn t think it mattered what i used to cut up food items boy was i wrong i love the hollow edge technique it really does keep the food from sticking to the knife ! it is worth spending the extra money on a few really good knives that you will never have to replace i would also recommend a good knife sharpener with those two items you will never have to purchase another knife again 
no buttery slips this butter dish is great because of the little top knot it s very easy to pick up the lid besides its cute 
great item beautiful exactly what the bride wanted nice packaging items arrived in perfect condition 
ultimate cool it looks beautiful and it has a toaster built in ! this little microwave gets more attention than any of my brand new stainless appliances in my recently remodeled kitchen at first i was hesitant about the lack of a touch keypad for entering cook times etc but i can honestly say that i do not miss this feature the dial on this unit replaces the standard touch pad found on most microwaves and is extremely effective and easy to use turn it fast for minutes and turn it slow for seconds it works much like the infamous click wheel on ipod sgreat form and function i m very pleased with this purchase 
nice personal coffee maker i read the reviews before i ordred this and was a little leary because of drips and after taste but ordered it anyway let me say that i love my new coffee maker i really like the fact that the pot has a lid that you can drink from you don t have to dirty another coffee cup some others reported that it drips when you drink but i have not had that happen to me i followed the manufacturers instructions to put a vinegar and water solution through it a couple of times before the first use and have not experienced the plastic after taste some people reported the top is a little bit hard to take off to add condiments but can be done with a little practice it is a little bit large to take with you in the car it does come with an attachment so that it fits down in a drink holder but my car has flip up covers on them and they get in the way of this fitting down in completely but i ve used it anyway with some success most importantly it makes excellent coffee glad i bought it 
really works i have to admit i didn t think this thing would work but i bought it for my mother who has smokers living next door and it was smelling up her condo after plugging this thing in the odor went away amazing ! after three weeks of operating it the blades were black when i wiped them clean the towel smelled of smoke amongst other things i d definitely refer others to it 
excellent coffee first let me say that this product makes excellent coffee i usually regret drinking regularly brewed coffee because of the acid but i ve been drinking this cold brewed coffee for two weeks now and have had no ill after effects the only reason i m not giving it stars is because it s basically just a couple of pieces of plastic and so i d consider it fairly overpriced for what you get what you get is a plastic carafe with snap on lid a container to put ground coffee in a filter pad and another container to put water in water empties through a small hole into the container with the ground coffee in it and you let it sit over night in the mornning pop the cork out of the coffee container on the bottom and let the syrup drain into the carafe through an included filter pad that s it you could if you were motivated enough make one of these out of those x large soda cups from but the coffee is excellent i ve been using it to make iced coffee and it s wonderful one part syrup parts milk a shot of chocolate syrup and you ve just saved yourself from starbucks it s that good its easy to use easy to clean you only have to use it once every week or so depending on how much coffee you drink and the coffee is excellent and it has low acid to boot disclaimer i like mellower roasts of coffee i ve never been a fan of very strong dark roasts and that may factor into my appreciation of cold brewed coffee smooth is how i d describe it 
best i have found of the several brands and types of jerky seasoning i have tried the nesco original flavor is clearly the best tasting if you like conventional jerky as i do if you like yours hot or spicy nesco has them as well in any case the nesco spices are far above the rest in my opinion da 
good quality and nice looking tank i purchased this tank months ago and have been fairly happy with it it looks nice i love the rounded corners which look much better than the glued glass panes the acrylic material is still holding up but i am a lot more careful cleaning it than with glass the only problem i ve had with this unit is a rattling noise that seems to come from the hood it can be quite for minutes to a couple of days then it starts rattling i adjust the hood and it goes away lately in the last couple of weeks the pump has started with some serious rattling which i can t get rid of it annoys me and i am sure the fish are even more annoyed i cleaned the impeller and every surface of the pump but without luck so i think i have to go buy a new pump 
a great belgian waffler i ve had this waffler for several months and use it regularly at least twice a week it produces a perfect belgian waffle every time 
better than expected i expected the typical dog toy which lives about half as long as it normally does thanks to my dog trying to tear it apart i m surprised that it not only has lasted as long as it has but doesn t have any loose stitchings yet 
great garlic keeper i was not disappointed in this item it is attractive and looks just like the picture it s a nice size not too small not too large 
very useful should be included with vacuum the low reach tool is very useful and easy to use fast to attach and good on every surface with this tool you can reach under the shallowest of furniture the only reason i don t give it five stars is because i think this tool should be included when you purchase the dc because of the dc s inability to get under almost all furniture unless you put the tiny tool on it which is tedious 
perfect for beginner and beyond whenever you add new tap water to your aquarium the chemistry of the water changes these changes can be very harmful to the fish depending on how drastic they are so it s recommended you do a water change every week to your aquarium to help reduce chemicals like ammonia and dilute the nitrites etc but the tap water also carries harmful chlorine and chloramine tetra aquasafe removes both and enhances the stress coat produced by your fish thus making it perfect to condition your aquarium i ve had no problems whatsoever with it and it has greatly improved the overall health of my fish i personally don t use it with every water change although its recommended that you do but that s usually based on the amt being added and the condition of my tap water use ml to treat ga 
convenient and attractive for a busy lifestyle this size is perfect size for small individual portions of mac n cheese lasagna cup of soup apple crumble great for large families where everyone wants to eat something different and busy singles who would rather freeze for later than eat the same leftovers for a week divide the recipe into individual portions and refidgerate freeze then just reheat as many portions as you need this way you can make more dishes and have a variety in the freezer for later prep washup is simple as the ramekins are attractive enough to double as serving pieces too 
gorgeous shape a wonderful bowl to use as a table centerpiece the pedestal bottom is subtle and still allows for stacking when storing as far as serving the bowl is about medium sized works well as a roll or biscuit holder salad mix for side salads or side dishes it is not quite big enough for main dishes for more than people it is a must have bowl for your fiestaware collection i read so many reviews from people who received broken dishes when ordering fiestaware from amazon the shippers must ve really changed their packing techniques because every piece of fiestaware that i ve received when ordering directly from amazon has been packed with much care and a lot of cardboard bumpers not a broken dish knock on wood 
great fast and simple no problems whatsoever arrived as expected in less than expected time thanks 
better than described highly recommended as good as you could ask for it does have a front light although some desciptions say it doesn t easy to use push and manuver even though not selfpropelled the spinning front brush moves the vac forward so you don t a need self pro pel for this eureka it s just a gimmick since it will wear out anyhow it did on my previous hoover not that heavy as described in some other reviews weight is not a concern at all my old hoover although about the same weight felt much heavier i would recommend this eureka to anyone looking for an upright for a bargin price you will not be disappointed 
these bakers are wonderful lecreuset is simply the best these are an ideal size for one or two people the larger one holds chicken breasts or roasted potatoes or vegetables the small one is a perfect one serving size for a fruit cobbler they hold the heat for a long long time and are a breeze to clean besides being really pretty to look at i do love my lecreuset 
fantastic sheets since i shop at amazon all the time for bedding and toys i knew a bargain when i saw one my only regret is that i didn t get sets these sheets are super soft and extremely high quality the seams and corners are better than sheets costing ten times as much ! i only paid but even at these are a steal ! i can t say enough how much i love them and i am a bedding fanatic 
good size double boiler good size easy to handle fit most to quart sauce pan yes the melted chocolate will stick in the rim 
some inexpensive entertainment i love this little fish bowl i have had no problems with the size or quality of the bowl when i clean the bowl i gently remove it from the base use both hands take it to the sink do not pour the water out of the bowl leave the betta in the bowl just be gentle and slow with your movements i use a turkey baster and suck the yuck and food that has settled to the bottom of the bowl i clean the bowl every to days so there is not much junk in the bowl to suck out take your time and move your baster around the bottom and squirt it out in the sink with each fill of fish water my charley brown doesn t mind at all having his home cleaned if you take it slow and gentle and don t disturb him after about half the bowl of fish water has been removed take a paper towel and run it around the inside of the bowl and remove any residue that may have built up on the inside of the bowl i use spring water that i pick up at walmart in the gallon jugs very slowly pour and fill the bowl back up to the top i leave about an inch of space at the top the fish does better if you leave some of his old water in his bowl the fish gets stressed if only all fresh water is used to replace his water replace the bowl back in its base using both hands gently i can t emphasize enough show and gently when doing this job your betta will love you for it if you are having a lot of junk in your bowl you are feeding too much i only give little pellets every other day don t seem like much but its plenty and the betta is fine without a heater for the bowl unless in the winter you sit him outside on the patio now that would not be good keep your baster only for your betta bowl don t want turkey in your betta bowl my charlie is thriving so i must be doing something right if you don t have much space you will love this make the cat keep her paws to herself 
like the festive colors enjoy the different colors able to mix and match to suit moods or food being served they seem to wear well and be chip resistant the only downside for me is that one of the cinnabar plates came with an etched scratch mark on it not sure if it was from manufacturing it is only slightly visible they are standard size dinner plates at times wish they were just a little bit bigger otherwise so far quite happy with them and they can always be replaced 
optima vaccuum very good suction and light weight dust cup is easy to empty but dust does cling to the filter the extension hose is a bit short and sometimes gets disconnected from the unit it should have a more secure lock on the hose connection 
great cleaver for the money great weight ok balance well made good quality metal for the price a great bargain 
great little heater even if not perfect i inherited this heater and admit that i wanted it for sentimental value but i love it now ! having the ability to target a particular temperature is great i wouldn t want a heater without that feature what i would like is the ability to point the airstream up or down in addition to swiveling on the base it is wonderfully light and compact and feels very safe though looks aren t important to me this little unit is more attractive than many others i ve seen 
love this baker i recently replaced my pyrex because of safety concerns based on my experiences with a piece exploding i purchased several chantal items after looking at ceramic and stoneware bakers that were much more expensive because of the price i decided to try a few pieces and see what happened i am glad i did because i love all my chantal bakeware and this baker is by far my favorite i like to cook on saturdays and i usually find myself baking to main dishes like chicken pork chops caserole etc that will last a few days that way during the week i can alternate main dishes and only have to make sides desertsi purchased two of these and a couple of smaller pieces and they fit toether well for storage food cooks evenly i always check with a meat thermometer for example chicken in the middle of the pan gets heated just as thoroughly as food on the sides these pans look nice enough for serving at the table and clean up like a breeze if you soak it the residue gets so loose that cleaning it only requires minimal effort i am very pleased with this purchase it was well worth the money 
bold large and beautiful these bowls were everything i hoped they would be they are a beautiful bold red colorthe bowls are about inches across the top and almost inches deep so they hold a large serving of soup or chili i love the shape of the bowls not too wide but deep something you can hold in one hand easy to drink out of also ! 
love your espresso best bet for the money i could not resist trying this method of making espresso you know you can spend alot trying to get a decent product and i have not been disappointed with the practically inexpensive bialetti the first attempt was successful and that told me this was for me the bonus milk frother made more froth that an old steamer frother i used to have there are a few tricks with the frother milk by itself not so good but add some half and half to the milk and voile the milk mixture needs to be heated enough to coat the back of a spoon pump it quickly and serve regarding the espresso maker itself just don t add any more water than to that line and oh don t open the lid to look at it until it is done or you will get sputter onto your stove top to know when the espresso is done just listen you will know when it is done very quick and yummm 
nice timer i use this timer more than my oxo twist nring type of timer the keypad makes it very easy to set the timer beep is plenty loud and continues to ring for seconds until you stop it if you don t stop it it will give you reminder beep every seconds one nice feature of this timer is the memory function it allows you to set the timer back to the last setting with a simple press of the clear memory button pros easy to set loud beeper with reminder beeps operates as a digital clock when not being used as a timer can be set from second to hours minutes seconds timer can be paused if needed via start stop button compact size rubber non skid feet keep timer firmly planted solidly builtcon s the buttons are easy to push but the clear memory andstop start buttons are somewhat difficult to press i findthat i have to check each time i start the timer to verifythat it truly did start no beep confirmation for button presses lcd display can be a little hard to read in certain lighting condition 
i love this knife i have been using the kyocera black ceramic chef s knife for years and someone got me this knife for christmas and it is my new favorite knife and i use it as my no knife now i don t care too much for rachael ray or the fact that she endorses it because really this knife doesn t need celebrity endorsements you hold this thing in your hand and it feels like it becomes one with your hand it is the perfect weight and it has a quality edge whoever made this knife really did their homework 
best buy this unit performs as well as those costing twice the price can t imagine why anyone would want to spend more 
hottstuff this is a very good product well priced good looking large inside and heats up food very fast overall a great product 
surprisingly effective and easy i ve rented carpet cleaners they work ok when i realized that i could buy something that worked and not have to worry about the hour rental period i decided to give it a try the machine arrived in good shape i put it together filled the soap and water dispensers and started to use it the results are at least as good as with the rental machines and wow is it so much easier to use i haven t had it a long time nor have i used it heavily so i can t offer any comments on durability what i don t like the plastic hose tool carrier on the upright portion doesn t do a good job of holding the hose power cord and or tools what i do like the aptly named dirt devil does a great job the dirt gets sucked away the two dispensers for soap and water are very convenient to use i like the clear plastic parts so i can see what s going on since i don t have to worry about return deadlines i can do parts of the house at my convenience the price is right what you should know buy some soap the bottle that comes with it will get you started but not much more bottom line if you have a closet or basement to store it and especially if you ve rented a carpet cleaner more than twice i can highly recommend a system like this i haven t compared this brand model with others but i ve had a great experience with this one 
cookin with little people these are fabulous for giving preschoolers independence in the kitchen i can simply ask my son to give us two scoops of the yellow one scoop of the blue etc the only reason i wouldn t give them a five is that the vertical handles can sometimes be a bummer when you re working for a level scoop 
great design compact and handy it seems i ve spent years trying to find the perfect teakettle something that would give an good honest audible whistle when boiling then allow one to pour the steaming hot water without having to put a hand anywhere near the spout that didn t seem like much to ask but we had a heck of a time finding such a thing we found some that were close but which you can fill only through the spout it seems to me that one should have a lid on a pot like this to be able to get inside and clean it inspect for damage or wear or whatever and suddenly we came across this one on amazon there was a cup version and two cup versions there is one with a copper bottom to resemble the traditional revereware look but after looking at the pictures we bought the one that is pure stainless steel top to bottom the entire top of the pot is a non shiny plastic of some kind one of those new space age materials that does not get as hot as metal or some other materials the designers at revere should be commended for making a total break with tradition so they could create a pot that is so practical the lid on top is not centered beneath the handle which means you can reach inside or fill it more easily than in the typical pot where the handle gets in the way the handle is very well balanced and the trigger to open the spout is well positioned you can hold the spout partly open or pull it completely open at which point the trigger locks it in the open position this saves a lot of finger fatigue when pouring multiple cups of tea or whatever to close it one simply pushes forward on the back of the trigger you don t need the instructions although they are included when you pick this thing up to pour with it it feels totally natural in your hand and you figure it out instinctively it s great the spout has a slight diagonal crease in its tip for drip free pouring which is just another thoughtful feature in an overall thoughtful and original design we chose the larger size mostly to be able to serve more than a couple of people at a time if we should have company and we re glad we made that choice because honestly the cup version looks small compared to our old kettle the other one was more rounded and perhaps a larger capacity i haven t measured the capacity of the revere model as i m not that obsessed with it and i m sure it will suit our needs i suspect that the compact appearance is most likely a function of efficient design this is one of those purchases that in its own small way makes every day better by improving a small task that one does frequently of course it s far too early to tell how it will stand up to long use but we re quite satisfied with ours and expect it to be a pleasure for a long time 
no more rug doctor after years of renting rug doctors we decided to buy our own carpet cleaner we were also motivated by having two dogs who bring too much of the yard with them on our off white carpets when they come in from playing also one of them is a puppy who thought it convenient to pee on the carpet a few times after reading other reviews we selected the hoover f we wash the living area carpets about once a month and have already spent less on the hoover then we would have by renting a cleaner the carpets are as clean as with a bigger rug doctor we have found that going over an area with just hot water after cleaning it with the detergent helps keep the carpet clean for a longer period of time we are very happy with our hoover it is fairly light easy to fill and empty and easy to clean both the tanks and the brushes as other people have commented the attachment hose tends to fall off so we just leave it off otherwise it s a heck of a deal ! 
open french skillet i purchased this product as a gift and it turned out to be absolutely wonderful the color is a beautiful red which matched the kitchen it is large easy to clean and the best feature is the extra handle 
love this product i love my mellita one one i use it at work and have saved lots of money at the coffee shop ! i had difficulty finding a variety of coffee pods locally and couldn t find any tea pods however i ordered several varieties of each at amazon com i received them within a week and the shipping was free ! the hazelnut and french vanilla are my favorites and i don t think they taste like instant coffee 
great product has bought all my knives back to life it takes no time at all to sharpen a knife and it s very sturdy 
all clad cookware set this product lived up to the all clad reputation as a quality set of cookware having had commerical non stick calphlon the cleanup is a little more intensive but the fact that the product cooking surface is all ss is important to me primarily from a durability perspective i will be buying more all clad products 
cannot be happier i cannot say enough good things about this dehydrator i ve used it for almost a year now and i m churning out jerky and fruit leather in huge batches a few times a year and we always have healthy snacks on hand ive added trays so i m up to and even with a full load drying times are very quick ground beef jerky sticks dry in or hours jerky strips in less than that and fruit leather takes to hours depending on what i m drying and how thick i want it i can dry pounds of jerky sticks at one time so it lasts for awhile i tend to make several flavors all at one time so everyone is happy the fan is a little loud but it s pushing a lot of air and it doesn t interfere with our tv watching in the living room next to the kitchen anyone who is serious about drying food should give this serious consideration yes it s pricier but you can expand to a ridiculous number of trays and get the same results so it really does amortize well when you look how much you can make at one time stock up on the mesh screens and leather trays when you expand the number of shelves and you can be in jerky and leather all year long 
a useful addition to your kitchen knife collection excellent for slicing ripe tomatoes and thick skinned fruit as well as dinner rolls this is a great little knife to complement a quality set of sharp non serrated knives 
just the thing for my vintage recipe when i received this item i was surprised how small it looked ! there is a big difference between my pie plates and this one however it was just what my grandmother s vintage pecan pie recipe called for for years i had compromised by using my baker as it is pretty hard to find ones today this baker was ideal for my needs as well as a compliment to my varied line of fiestaware i love it 
my mini pins favorite thing first let me say i have tried lots of beds for my dog and she hasnt been jazzed by any of them but this one was a hit out of the ball park i have this on my bed for her to sleep in it that she can cuddle under the top is heaven to a dog who prior to this would try and crawl up my pajamas everynight i guess that makes it heaven to me too its nice and soft and cuddly lots of cushioning its probably the thing i bought for my little ginger that she actually likes more than i do 
great oven mitts excellant protection and grip will not burn wipes off easily stores more easily than reqular oven mitts wish i d found these years ago 
kitchen aid stands behind what they sell i ordered my first mixer it was shiney and i was excited to use it the first time i used the mixer it fell apart literally the screws fell out of the bottom and the head of the mixer fell forward in the mixing bowl i was sick about it and called the kitchen aid number that is right on the mixer i told them what happened they sent me out a new mixer immediately ! they even paid for the pick up of the broken mixer although i was upset they really did stand behind their mixer and were very nice about now i love this mixer 
slept for days straight ok just kidding these pillows are awesome i prefer a bit more fluff but i m rating these based on what they are and claim to be not on what i want them to be very well made very comfortable for sleeping on your stomach so if you re a back side sleeper seek a more stable pillow 
great this contact grill panini grill is great ! we moved into a rd floor condo without a place for outside cooking but since we bought this grill i can t say we miss it this grill heats up extremely well something my several george foreman grills didn t do we like it for steaks and hamburgers my husband says the ones i do are as good as he did on the grill it is also very fast we grill thin steaks in minutes it took minutes on our gas grill we also like it for grilled sandwiches like reubens the bread comes out crisp and the center is completely heated through we like the temperature choices it doesn t have removeable plates nothing to break ! they wash off easily i put wet paper towels in it and let it sit while we eat i would recommend it to anyone look for it in the warehouse stores as well 
stars item for a stars price we have been using our toast ovens everyday for the last yrs or so we had expensive ovens we had not so expensive ovens they all died after several years of services no matter what so why bother to spend dollars for a machine that just makes a little bit difference for a machine this is really a good buy no complaints so far 
erbabe don t hesitate to buy this light weight blanket it is wonderfully made the reason i m giving it a rating is that it fits my california king bed i ve looked high and low to find a blanket that fits this one does ! buy this blanket with confidence deffinately a great find on amazon and the price wasn t bad either 
no problem with synthetic corks i purchased this with every intention of returning it if it did not perform happily it exceeded my expectations easy to use fast and attractive design i hate to admit i m buying more wine just because i like opening the bottles ! unlike a few reviewers i have had no trouble opening synthetic corks in fairness the instructions do mention that some synthetic corks might not come out easily however it has not been the case in my experience in fact most of the corks i ve removed have been synthetic and they came out easily 
perfect for pasta i love this container i keep my linguini and spaghetti in it after i open the box and it keeps it fresh ! the lid is held securely on by air ! you squeeze two tabs with your fingers on the top to let the air out to open close it with the lid on its an airtight seal so no more worrying about bugs or stale pasta i like the clear canister because i can easily see if i have some open pasta before i get a new box out of the pantry and its made of a very durable material that won t break and is dishwasher safe if you eat a lot of pasta but don t always eat the whole box in one sitting then this is a must have 
love them i love the house air filters but the ones for the car don t seem to work well i have placed one of the air purifiers in my son s room and notice a difference in the first hours it is worth the money 
great for cooking i m using this pot for rice cookingit takes less than mini and the quality is goodi like it 
i like it this spice rack saves space in my kitchen cabinet and makes finding spices while i m cooking so much easier i have had no problems with the quality of the materials or breakage and i use it daily i plan on buying another 
great pad this is a nice thick pad and an excellent bargain you probably won t find a better pad especially at this price 
salton tea maker this tea maker makes delicous tea the unit is light weight and the price was great our only complaint with it is the security of the basket filterteabag holder even though i lock it as it says if i don t position the pitcher just right under the basket where the spring is the basket can fill with tea and overflow i usually have to check it and move it as necessary and even re lock the basket to prevent this from happening 
kitchenaid reconditioned blender overall i like this blender prosvery quietgood price probably have to pay more for a different brand w sharp blades see cons below nice designcons blades not suited for chopping they re designed for crushing things like ice doesn t work great for things like fruit smoothies there are chunks of fruit left that don t get liquified i have an oster blender and its blades are sharp the ka blender blades are blunt 
wonderful product this krumkaka baker is wonderful i have a stove top krumkaka maker and always had trouble with it took a long time to bake krumkaka and such made a batch of krumkaka right away after receiving the new electric baker and match a full batch in less than an hour and they were delish i would highly recommend this baker to anyone that has ever considered buying one it is a wonderful machine love the non stick surface ! 
form and function this is a great little timer ! sure it s not all fancy and digital but it gets the job done just the same and it adds a bit of whimsy to my little kitchen when i have freinds over for dinner they comment on how cute it is the ringer is loud enough that i can hear it anywhere in my level apt if you are upstairs or downstairs you might not be able to hear it as well though if you are looking for a cute basic timer this is it 
you get what you pay for i will make this short and sweet the pan looks great cooks great and the final product most importantly tastes great 
nice look but doesn t retain heat the black cup is unique and eye catching but the lid is not airtight and therefore leaks and does not keep the liquids hot i still think it looks cool 
worth every penny you won t believe how much difference a shower filter can make this one is wonderful ! my brush comb just glide through my long hair now instead of dealing with tangles hair braking off my skin is so soft even without a moisturizer my soap shampoo lather much better i m able to smell the scents so much better i d highly recommend this product 
love our lodge we love to cook and we have all the expensive stuff we love nothing more than our cast iron and lodge makes great ones at decent prices 
it works surprisingly this vented plastic storage container actually keeps bread fresh pricey little devil 
very pleased i was very pleased with this product i gave them as a present the only reason i did not give a five star is because i ordered three sets and one set was chipped and scratched up however the return process was excellent it was just aggrevating that i was giving it as a gift and had to go through the return process but the product itself was perfect for what i was looking for 
excellent product these are wonderful barstools with very comfortable cushions all of my friends love them and want to know where i got them i plan to buy several more to complete a set for my bar i couldn t ask for a better quality product 
very nice pans very nice quality pans i got these pans and have yet to use them they are nice quality and i will be excited to use them with my christmas baking next year they don t recommend dishwasher use which is a disappointment to me but other than that they appear great will work great for regular cookies and bars as well 
bathroom wall shelf well considering that i was shipped the wrong item this piece has worked out ok the construction is solid stable sturdy and attractive it was not difficult to assemble i would have returned the item but the price on this item was terrific it would have cost more to return it than i paid for the shelf 
great screen is a breeze to clean wow ! this baby is even easier to clean than i thought my biggest frustration has always been scrubbing my splatter screen clean after using it after about minutes of spraying foam all over my kithen counter and sink i give up and just choose to live with a screen full of schmuck no more thank you tovolo but seriously why the removable handle 
i m in love with my pots my husband gave me a piece set for mother s day last year and i could not love these pots and pans more ! the stews roasts and braises i have made are delicious ! i cook many curries we love indian and the enamel holds up beautifully despite the turmeric and the grill pan does a great job making crispy bacon ! i have the oval dutch oven and am not sure what to do with it besides making a roast chicken with cloves of garlic but i am sure i will come up with something ! my set is red which really brightens up my beige and black kitchen 
very good but one big flaw i like this spatula i do but if you are working with dough it is useless the spatula end is detachable which i recommend when washing because bits of food can get stuck in the seam and inside the spatula tip i use it all the time however with doughy mixes it is useless and i go back to the old wooden one the spatula tip just comes off and gets stuck in dough if it was one solid mold with no chance of detaching i would give it five stars 
mine works i guess i bought a good one this thing works great no leaks no white dust and very quiet the de mineralization filters are easy to find at target and are for two filters i like this product 
great convienence got this a couple of days ago and i couldn t be happier its quite and does a great job it will only do small loads so don t think your putting pairs of jeans in make sure you install the bottom plate correctly otherwise it will sound like a jackhammer the plate should stick out not go into the bottom also if you need to move it i recommend buying the rolling art from lowe s for bucks 
great skillet we were somewhat skeptical about buying a dual purpose skillet griddle but after using found it to be the best ! we use the griddle all the time and like the deep skillet that provides for cooking large roasts 
vrrooommm and presto almost well as others have said its pretty much does what it says it will for bucks its ok but the ice tray is kinda on the cheap side and i can see breaking the plastic lock on it while opening it to fill with ice someday in the near future also see the cheap plastic lock tab on the container that holds the melted ice water breaking soon enough that aside it appears to be made pretty well make sure your ice cubes are not in big frozen clumps as it may make the machine freeze jam while attempting to shave the ice had a party the other day and without even a dry run made excellent margarias and cherry daiquiris with little fuss or muss buy one at once and get your favorite brain freeze going if i only had one of these in college 
great product we ordered this item and it s not only useful as a trivet to place hot pots on but also great to use as a oven mitt it s very flexible so when i pulled out a hot cookie sheet my fingers didn t get burned ! i highly recommend it it is a bit tricky to grasp the hot items but you just have to arranget it so 
i m hooked on this gadget i bought one a few years ago got hooked cant drink my morning coffee without frothy milk ! it finally broke so i went online to replace it i ve seen other types but this style is the one i had to have ! found it new at amazon com for the same price i paid years ago it came in a few days and works beautifully i m a happy camper again 
as easy as cutting warm butter why did i ever use the elbow greese and stone methode to sharpen my knives i recieved this sharpener as a gift setup was easy i just pulled it out of the box made a couple of miner settings then pluged it in in a matter of minutes i was shapening my dull kitchen knives the sharpening action is very easy just run the knife through the first slot a few time then through the second slot a few more and with the aid of the electric motor my knives come out sharper then when new i ve used this sharpener or so times now and it still puts a fantastic edge on my knives this sharpener would ve been well worth my investment with just the time i save not having to sharpen by hand had i bought it for myself it does it s job well 
the copper s nice but the plastic isn t these copper canisters are handsome but there are some caveats needing mention first the so called vacuumseal stated in its description is a misnomer there is no suctioning force to remove the air from the canisters if the seal was actually rubber they would have worked more easily but this seal is a hard plastic cup like ring that extends down from the lid to mate with the interior brim of the canister and the lids would not function if you were to remove them like i wanted to next problem the lids again now they re too tight ! i have to hold the canister against my chest to pull it off not convenient this means the contents of the canister might jerk up and out when it pops open quirkiness given it should still keep the bugs out better than any loose ceramic set the company is named old dutch but these are made in china not the netherlands additionally the canisters have no labeling like sugar or flour or a designated place for a label another inconvenience brass labels would have added character for the dollars these copper cans will still function and sit pretty no matter where you put them and if you want them mostly for that with just some occasional use you have found an eligible set 
perfect for use on top of a boiling pan this cover works great in my saute pan and is perfect for use on top of a sauce pan when steaming or even boiling pasta no more boil overs a bit pricey as a microwave cover but cannot complain about performance 
flexible in shape and in color i bought both of my boys this hamper when i redecorated their rooms it goes with anything and the mesh allows the clothes to breathe between laundry days i wish it was a bit larger in capacity but and year old boys seem to get their clothes in there and when it is full to the top then they know it s time to bring their hampers to the laundry room also we plan to bring one with us on vacations now because it is easy to collapse and pack 
great frozen pizza plate my husband and i fight over this plate when we have frozen pizza a tombstone pizza fits great on this plate 
good support this neck pillow offers considerable support under the neck bought it to replace an old one that had become thread barehusband uses it all the time 
must have accessory for the led version of zelco s excellent itty bitty booklight assure brightest light and eliminates need to change batteries every few days 
excellent great product for the price paid for a king sized waterproof mattress pad hard to find one for that price in the stores with such a high level of quality i am extremely pleased with my purchase 
excellent addition i love this butter dish ! i have looked at several and found this one to be the best quality and such a wonderful match to the naturewood collection it s a must have 
kettle is the bomb this kettle works perfect it is much faster than stovetop and all features work as advertised what else is there to be said ! stars 
dualdaddy great purchase exactly what i expected good service by amazon good price shipped quickly and the fryer seems to be even better heats quicker larger capacity than the old frydaddy many years old which i dropped and broke i m very satisfied 
fantastic flannel sheets these sheets are warm soft and ever so inviting garnet red just made for an even better valentine s day evening even though it was weeks later truely lovely sheets would buy more 
superb quality our queen mattress is not a pillow top so the fitted sheet is deeper than necessary but it tucks under fine having the elastic around the entire fitted sheet helps with this the lace edge needs to be ironed after they come out of the dryer but that only takes a minute these sheets have held up well so far and feel great if you get the ruby color make sure you wash them in cold to keep their bright color and prevent color runs 
great product but poor shipping my only complaint is that amazon does not properly pack their products it took attempts to get them here with out any damage ! the canisters are pretty and are able to hold a large amount of product 
this is a great idea thought this was a great idea when i saw it so i purchased it 
good food processor likes very quiet compared to our last food processor powerful no problem doing pizza dough very solid construction however this makes the base very heavy dislikes short center shaft will leak if you have more than a few cups of liquid overall this food processor is so much better than our old one the low liquid capacity is our only gripe so far 
awesome dispenser i ordered of the dual dispensers and they work incredibly well they are the perfect height for the back of the counter under cabinets and look very professional in one pair we put ground and bean coffee rice and flour in another pair and cereals in the last pair we tried using one for sugar but it leaked easily and seems to work best with larger dry goods though the flour one does fine will order another pair for dog food and another for a b day gift 
a keeper i have used many different brands of coffemakers but this one will be my last it easily makes the best coffee this may be because of the use of a paper filter and more than one drip hole which slows the coffee from leaving the grounds too quickly or it may be because the coffee filter is placed into the decanter my other coffee makers used a plastic filter or permanent weave type and the coffee poured through in order to get hot coffee though you must follow the directions and heat your cup with hot water it also helps if the water you add is not from the refrigerator the hottest coffee i ve had came from a percolator i like the fact that the water tank can be removed to fill or left in and the cup amounts are clearly visible when adding water i do wish the top had been hinged to the unit though i also think it is too expensive 
a must have for ultra sharp knives this very understated plain looking piece of kitchen equipment looks rather like a conventional sharpening steel with a white rod but is in fact an ultra fine grit sharpening tool dont be fooled by the modest appearance this is a very high precision piece of equipment for high quality knives eg global that are already sharp but need that extra finish on the edge to achieve a truly razor sharpness this ceramic rod is superb global actually recommend ceramic instead of steels and once you use this product you will see why incidentally global also market their own ceramic sharpener and it s made by you guessed it kyocera all knives will lose their ultra sharp edge in normal use and the usual method of refreshing re aligning the edge is to use a steel this ceramic rod takes this process to a new level the ultra fine ceramic actually sharpens the edge as well as re aligning it the result is an incredibly sharp razor edge usually with a few strokes i have been using it for about months now mainly on my global knives and it is the best sharpening rod i have used lot s better than conventional or diamond steelsi recommend using it like a steel with gentle strokes alternating from side to side holding the knife at very slightly greater angle than the sharpened angle not just for japanese knives this great product also works just fine on european knives buy it without hesitation 
the best pot in the house i never though that i would pay for a pot but i m glad i spent the money on this one it arrived in perfect condition and was put to the test immediately there are no hot spots and the pot is fairly easy to clean all of the receipes that we ve tried have been marvelous the meats are so tender and juicy they melt in your mouth this dutch oven has taken on favorite status in our house highly recommended 
nice product i use my blender for protein shakes and it works very well chopping frozen fruit and mixing the product does exactly what it says it will do however i didn t think about the fact that some of your contents will get stuck at the top when you turn it over to blend you sometimes have to do a little shaking to get everything down to reach the blade i still give it stas though since it does work very well 
just perfect i snatched the last two boxes last night this works perfect with my tall rust color iron headboard and my high mattress i was afraid they would be too small but they re actually of a decent size for a nightstand the drawer looked flimsy on the display at the store but after a quick min assembly at home i could see a pretty sturdy piece of furniture the drawer looked amp worked great best of all price something similar would have cost me at least pottery barn 
loving them purchased these bright pink sheets for my year old daughter the fun bold color and the high quality are beyond my expectations she has only two sets of sheets so they are in and out of the laundry quite a bit they fit wash and wear well saying i am pleased is an understatement 
very satisfield so far i am very satisfied with this product i was surprised how large the basket was it handles the needs of our family quite well and i love the fact that oil isn t splattering all over my walls 
great table and chairs i ordered the rectangular version of this table and chairs set even after reading the other reviews this was after my husband said that he could get it together no problem when the table and chairs arrived my husband was busy so i tried putting everything together i had a hard time getting all the screws in and was close to stripping the heads as well my husband helped me out he backed out all the screws applied soap to them as lubrication ie from a bar of bath soap and screwed them back in the table and chairs are as sturdy as can be and the quality of wood is wonderful especially for the price most sets i looked into were in the to range i would recommend this product 
a must for all bakers i love this new aluminum rolling pin ! it is fast approaching my favorite time of year and i am gearing up for tons of baking i give away baked goodies to our neighbors during the holiday season which in my mind starts in october i love the weight of this one just throw it in the fridge for about minutes i did it while i was making the dough and it works great i was making molasses cookies and the dough didn t stick at all ! i am a sucker for red so i also love the color 
my jewelry is organized now it s easy to access you can actually see everything you own and if you organize it by color you can see what you still need my sister admired mine so i got her one for christmas and she was thrilled 
great for those with limited space excellent invention ! some minor pitfalls first of all i love these they fold neatly take up little cabinet space etc however it does not say on the package that they are microwave or freezer safe i find that info only here on amazon which leaves me wondering are they or aren t they secondly because the flattened containers have to be pushed open these might be difficult for an elderly person to handle it isn t exactly hard to do but does take at least normal strength average strength not something a weak ill or otherwise impaired person might manage other than that i think they are great they clean up nicely store food the lids stay in place etc now if i only know about their microwave capabilities ! 
worth the money i have two of these in my home and they really help to cut down on smells and dander from our two cats and the filters are inexpensive enough to be able to change regularly 
great pizzelle maker i ve had this iron for several weeks and am very happy with it the iron heats quickly and makes crisp pizzelle despite the manufacturer s claim that you do not need to oil the cooking surface i ve had to add a bit of oil to the top and bottom plates prior to cooking the pizzelle to prevent sticking other than that it is a good iron for the money 
a new experience in cutting clean elegant easy to use and clean but this cutting board has an aesthetic appeal that goes beyond mere functionality clean lines thinner than most boards and the look and feel of wood without the practical and bacterial problems a joy to use 
hepa air purifier the air purifier arrived in a timely fashion so far so good 
no kitchen is complete without these i love these dishes ! the proportions color vibrance surface wearability and chip resistance can t be beat for the price ! i suggest buying a few colors to mix and match these dishes come in so many great colors ! if you re considering a lesser priced set i was spend a little bit more the extra quality and classic style are definitely worth it 
kitchen aid mixer i bought this mixer for my daughter for a wedding present i own one myself and it s wonderful ! it is able to mix a large amount and do a good job it s sturdy and a great product ! 
absolute best buy in a chef s knife i bought this knife after reading a review of inch chef s knives in cook s illustrated they rated this knife above all others including knives costing more than a hundred dollars it arrives in extremely sharp condition i ve used some expensive chef s knives and even an expensive henckels santoku none were as good as this knife 
decent space heater this heater does a nice job heating a small area it s pretty quiet and the fan forced output is about what you d expect from a fan set on slow doesn t get hot to the touch a little top heavy falls over with very little help but shuts itself off heat proximity breaker takes minutes to reset that s too long the automatic switching between w and w works but it really needs an obvious manual lo hi switch it says three speeds in the writeup i found two the switch to disable eco save mode leaves it set at w which is too high on a shared bathroom circuit trips our house gfi breaker at least once every couple weeks seems to be something to do with the tip over shutoff 
desk review nice desk what i needed for the space that i have i ordered the matching hutch but there was no way to attach it to the desk i wish the computer keyboard pullout was actually a drawer 
amazing i ve had other down comforters before this one that were a couple hundred dollars each i could hardly believe the price ! it really is the deal of the century this one does poof up nicely the down really does stay evenly distributed and it is so warm ! it is by far the best down product i ve ever had 
a pretty good canister i love fiestaware and these canisters go perfectly in my kitchen i like that they are large enough to get a decent amount of flour and sugar in them the seal seems really airtight but i did accidently splash some water on the top of them and the water did get into the canister they are easy to clean and look very classic 
you really need this floor sweeper at first this thing is pretty odd it is rather expensive and appears to be a simple mechanical device when cleaning the bare floors in my home it does a better job than regular vacuum cleaners for cleaning bare floors and flat carpets nothing is better than this mechanical brush floor sweeper and i give it my highest recommendation this happy little device is in my hall of fame floor sweepers vacuums the other members are the wet and dry shop vac and the panasonic professional vacuum cleaner i have used this sweeper or ones like it at various jobs over the years cleaning the floors carpets in restaurant dining rooms only recently however did i actually get one for my home and i love it since it is lightweight and easy to use many floors now get daily cleanings rather than their traditional weekly ones it does an amazingly complete job of sweeping up every particle of dust and debris on the floor if you have allergies it is important to note that this sweeper does not kick up any dust which brooms and vacuums all do since it is mechanical it will work even during power failures when you fold the handle down flat it requires only inches of vertical clearance for sweeping under furniture note that this sweeper does better in large clear areas like the living room rather than small places that require manuevering like around the chairs and table interestingly it sweeps on both the forward and backward strokes this also means that it has dust pans that you have to remember to clean out not just one i do have a few quibbles about it in order to fit into the box the handle is in pieces if you do not jam them together hard the handle might come apart although this has never happened to me it has trouble picking up small pebbles and pieces of glass the brushes get stuck full of dust bunnies and the supplied brush cleaner not only falls off the handle a lot it does a poor job of cleaning the brushes and you have to pull out the dust bunnies with your fingers anyway there is a inch gap in front since the brushes are recessed back from the front of the pan like when you push it up against a wall this means that in order to clean the wall edges you have to run the sweeper against the wall and parallel to it note that this sweeper does bare floors and flat carpets only if the carpet is pile shag or is not totally flat and hard you are out of luck 
well worth the price of admission i really like this item it s simple but attractively so and it s a really good deal also it s sturdy glass its got a good heft to it and it s not a shatter waiting to happen think of it as the quoteverydayquot decanter that you can use without fear while you re waiting for the perfect occasion to break out that nice pricey waterford job that you got for you wedding 
more than one way to fry a donut i m a proud celiac chick from finland but i m also a lover of homemade donuts now for those of you who don t know what celiacs are we can t eat any wheat or gluten in plain speak no i m not implying you re stupid we can t eat flour it runs along the lines of an allergy although the experts will gladly look down their noses and tell you it is not so how the heck do i eat donuts when they re made completely of flour the answer is my cooking angel bette hagman who wrote up a donut recipe in one of her books more from the gluten free gourmet anyway i use that recipe however i don t use this donut mold like i m supposed to no i don t do baked donuts whats a donut if you don t do the indulgent full fat thing i put the batter into three of the molds at a time tip it into the oil and i deep fat fry those little suckers and god are they good ! so my ultimate point here is that this donut mold is extremely useful in more ways than one so grab one especially if you re a celiac and put your imagination and cooking skills to work 
get grilled great for grilled cheese ham and cheese or roast beef sandwiches it also works good with fruit fillings we just sprinkle powdered sugar on top after they are done our daughter used hers when we visited and after seeing how quick and easy it was to useand then tasting the results we knew we had to buy one for ourselves it makes it easy to make either one or two sandwiches at a time i am glad we bought one because it came in handy for quick hot lunch snacks when i was hunting up north the bos 
great food processor but plastic bowl seems like cheap plastic the motor is great as it puree and chops 
best bur ginder for the price this grinder may be noisier than some others but it stays clean and grinds a perfect grind each and every time excellent 
babies too i recieved this as a gift we have a very open floor plan with stairs not a kid friendly house this gate has allowed me to block off wide openings so i can keep my mo old child in the living room as part of the family and not in a pen it s great ! it s also sturdy enough that he pulls himself up with it and it doesn t slip or turn over 
love butter you need a keeper love it that it keeps the butter soft and spreadable and fresh this one holds a larger amount than others i have had it is a bit more awkward to hold however it has a wide lid with no handle so you need to grab on to the sides of the lid to pick up love the emile henry colors 
portable heater easy to use very nice thermostat readout don t find this on many heaters ! quiet and even oscillating heat great heater for a small room 
great set but the picture made these appear bigger then the reality still worth it even though the sizes are listed i missed that and from the picture thought they were bigger after i got over the initial disappointment in size i realized they were really great to have for prep i am going back to school to be a chef and am really trying to practice mise en place in my own kitchen i think that is how you spell it i better learn before my final this set is great for the prep because it has two measuring amounts in one like cup and in the same cup which i came to realize has helped i bought these and the oxo piece prep bowl set with lids assuming i would try both and give one away i ended up keeping and using both 
decent i had to replace my space saver b d on a sunday morning i wanted another thermal carafe model but wasn t realy ready to shell out for the braun even witht the good reviews i found this on clearance at target for and i bought a cuisinart gold filter for it i did not like the fact the mr coffee filter had a solid bottom to the gold filter anways there is not much i can say bad about this machine things i like looks brew seletor self clean feature makes good coffee the carafe is one the best i have used the easy change water filter disks are a nice feature as well inexpensive and work pretty well i dont have any of the leak problems things i would change could make coffee a little hotter but not a deal breaker the unit beeps times when finished brewing not a big deal when everyone is up and moving but i tend to set it to go on before the family is up overall for what i paid for this i m very pleased 
simple but perfect at first i didn t think i would need this piece but after purchasing it i fell in love with it perfect for a plant on top and a small candle on bottom 
great crate in the past i have used the old stand by wire crates for my dogs i recently got a new puppy a maltipoo who is smaller than the dogs i have had in the past so i was looking for a smaller wire crate when i found this i love it ! this crate is easy to take up and down when visiting relatives it is very easy to pack up and take with us with soft sides i frequently find the puppy leaning against the sides as he is sleeping the walls on top and around the sides and front make it really easy to see what is going on inside the crate i bought the small which gives him plenty of room to move around at night i have him sleeping in a small airline crate he is getting too big for that so i am thinking of getting the extra small for night time use 
first fondue set a as this is my first fondue set and never had owned one before it was easy to set up an clean up was not bad i tried a cheese recpie that i found on it turned out great and would make again i would only advice i could offer is keep the box as most people don t have storage for like this i plan on using this here and there so i wouldn t leave this on a counter top year round it is attractive enough to do so if one wished i guess 
cat grass i have five cats and drinkwell water systems when i saw this new drinkwell aqua garden i was excited now my cats can eat grass whenever they want what a great idea 
a wonderful pan this is the best saute pan i have ever used it provides perfectly even heating and is very easy to clean 
great knife i bought this knife for boning deer and it works wonderfully ! i particularly like the flexible blade as it makes it easier to cut the meat off of the bone it is very strong too this is a high quality knife and i will purchase more global knives 
great item this item is a must have it s light weight and cleans well i love it 
wonderful choice i have always been a revere fan but this stir fry pan is wonderful ! we use it every chance we get well worth the price my only suggestion would be for the pan to be slightly larger 
simple and beautiful i love these glasses i think the traditional stemmed wine glass is fine but i find this far more practical while being elegant at the same time i have the set for sauvignon blanc as well which are very nice ill be buying more 
not as bad as the reviews i agree these aren t the softest i ve ever felt but i wasn t expecting egyptian cotton for bucks either so i didn t think they were nearly as bad as the reviews i read my year old son loves them and says they are comfortable i did not purchase the comforter though he has a down comforter which may add to the overall comfort of his bed i did use a few fabric softener sheets on the first wash 
glide shower curtain hooks these shower curtain hooks are fabulous never a snag no more ripped eyelets whoever invented these kudo 
replacement pitchers wonderful just like the ones that came with the mr iced tea maker shippment was fast and prompt i ordered so i d have a spare now i wished that i d ordered 
turner just what i needed to get under items close to the sides of the pa 
very clean presentation this server blends in well with any level of service a good size for rich sauces but a little small for gravy lovers bormioli always gives more than it costs i have lots of thier crystal 
very comfortable feels great ! never thought a sheet would make me sleep so much better 
wallace venetian good buy i received the flatware and was very pleased it has a nice weight and is shiny great for everyday use or special occasions i just wish it had come with the long teaspoons 
wonderful designed for specific purposes don t plan on using this as an all purpose crate puppies will chew through it if you try to use it as a permanent training crate it wasn t intended to be treated as airline baggage i got it primarily to get my puppy through her first long car trip home i m now using it as a safe way to take her on short trips and to train her to ride she seems to find it very secure comfortable and reassuring it sets up and folds quickly and easily it is light and easy to handle but very sturdy i use it mostly in the passenger seat of my car but wouldn t mind putting it in the back with my adult dog something i wouldn t dream of with a hard metal crate the one time the puppy upchucked the cleanup was trivial the bottom pan is held in place by velcro it got pulled out in a few seconds and then got hosed down the soft pad got hosed down and thrown into the washer and dryer i don t plan to use this more than a few months but at the end of that time i expect to have a sturdy confident and happy dog traveler 
just what i have been looking for i have had the more well known travel mugs and thought that they were the best well i was wrong this travel mug is by far the best out there it is truly leak proof my friends get tired of me turning it upside down i guess i m easily amused hehe but i really do like a mug that won t spill if tipped over when turned to the drink side the liquid flows at about the right rate not too fast not too slow anyway i can t say enough about this mug and the price also beats the competition i am not sure about the red color i have the blue and the black and i prefer the black out of the three choices 
hamilton beach trueair plug in air cleaner two pack very cool product i bought double packs because it was cheaper to just use the unit and the throw it away vs buying a filter these are very good though i ve been using them for the past months and i can definately notice a difference in the air quality they really pick up the dust which is what i wanted 
great coffee roaster we had one of the orginal hearthware roasters and wore it out after years of weekly roasting we looked at several other brands and went back to the newest hearthware and very glad we did the programed options are outstanding its easy to use and makes great coffee very consistant roasts a friend has another brand and can not get consistant results 
great for apple lovers this was a great gift very light weight and all seal really well 
marym this is an excellent pressure cooker at an excellent price i do feel they should have included a trivet and metal plate all of the accessories are extra i ordered the canning rack which holds pints i don t believe it would be wise to try to can quarts in this one but the directions were not clear in fact i would have given this a much higher rating if they were but i had trouble figuring out how to use it and one does want to follow directions where a pressure cooker is concerned they kept referring to to pressures hi and low i finally realized the qt model has both but not the and the directions were applicable to each model the quart pressures at lbs fasti once had fagor qt model and the metal was heavier than this one however the upside is that it is easier to lift up to pour things from it which is a plus if you re elderly as i am i really like they way this cooks fast easy to clean it s beautifully designed pan there are numerous uses for non pressure cooking too big enough for a stock pot cooking spagetting for a crowd etc etc i haven t canned with it however i plan on making a big pot of soup and canning what s left one reviewer mentioned that you can t fill it over full that is true of any pressure cooker so if you are debating between a quart or a quart go for the quart there are additional accessories for this canning rack bucket insert for spaghetti etc i recommend getting the lid for non pressured food and keep the pressure lid for pressure i don t think you will be disappointed with this product 
the cost is worth it i do think it s a bit overpriced but it works very well much better than a hose you have to hook up to a faucet 
oven mit i was looking for something to replace the pampered chef oven mitts cloth that i have used for over ten years the pampered chef mitt has been retired so i took a chance and ordered the kool tek i am very happy with it it works great 
great cutting board when this cutting board arrived i took it out of its box placed it over my stove top laid my head on it and laughed from sheer joy it covers the top of my stove exactly the wood is beautiful and warm i got mine late november early december and i use if everyday at least once and it still looks new it is easy to clean even if i left cut tomatoe and avocado or something the stains wipe right off ps i only use mine to cut fruit and veggies we are vegetarian 
love these bowls these are called fruit bowl but they are the perfect size for a couple of scoops of ice cream 
who doesn t love kitchenaid first i love kitchenaid what a quality product ! second i love the color yellow of this blender and the easy clean up there are no crevices for food to get in and around you wipe the button pad off and that is it whoever invented this feature deserves a gold medal i love my kitchenaid blender so much my parents bought one too 
sink strainer we like using our sink strainer it is very handy it is a good size to fit most things we need to getrinsed plus it has an adjustable feature that it willfit most sinks 
for the price great i used it with a duvet and find it very light and comfy others complain about its crinkly noise i find the crinkly noise very pleasant for you can t go wrong 
my mom loves it this is a very good quality item from farberware it s strong and cooks really well the price was is excellent too a stockpot such as this is one of those essentials you must have around the house as i said earlier my mom loves it and she s picky when it comes to cookware so most of you probably will enjoy it too 
very durable ! money well spent i have a purebred ladrador who is a strong chewer and destroys almost every toy i have bought her within days days max this toy however is very durable ! i bought it about months ago and there isn t a rip or hole on it it has a high pitch squeak to it when the dog or you squeezes the ball it definitely gets my dogs attention i really like this ball over other balls i have bought mainly because this one has feet with feet you can never predit where it will bounce or where it will decide to go it keeps my dog guessing and she loves playing fetch with it i am so happy so my purchase it s perfect for destructable puppies and adult dogs 
quick service on belt the belt was received very quickly and we were very satisfied with it donna wilso 
love it best piece i have bought thus far wonderful price and love that it came in the real box not the regular white box have made potatoes soups stew etc you need to have one ! 
excellent product care and feeding needed i have owned this for about months and gotten nearly uses out of it it counts for you it can equal most coffeehouse product you are likely to find but as others point out it is far short of what an enthusiast can create from more traditional equipment you may also find the crema coffee settings to be something of an acquired taste but you can make an americano in just one more step which is always great also we went through a brief episode in which it would refuse to brew anything as if it didn t have the power to punch the water through the puck of coffee i remedied this with a descaling cycle as well as wiping out the parts above the removable tray thoroughly i use filtered water in the machine but the descaling seems to be a more serious cleaning than the normal automatic cleaning given this i would recommend keeping large stock of cleaning supplies and at least doing the normal cleaning every couple of weeks rather than awaiting the machine s automated recommendation to clean my understanding is that there are no dirt sensors driving these messages it is just a function of the amount of use overall i would buy this again for certain and if when it dies i will be looking at one of its more expensive siblings not at other brands 
love this great cover to change the look of my room great deal for the price 
nice set i really enjoy the size weight and form of this silverware set the main fork is a little big but the salad forks more than suffice 
excellent and elegant i am usually wary of things coming in fancy boxes but these knives have turned out to be fantastic i purchased them without my wife knowing for a special dinner i had for a couple friends my wife didn t notice them until she sank the knife into her perfectly grilled rib eye the knife went through it like butter my guests were also impressed this helped to temper the scolding i got after they left for going over my kitchen gadget allowance as soon as they go on sale again in my gold box which now seems to filled with too much jewelry i ll purchase another sets immediately 
little but mighty this mini prep plus is perfect for the small jobs you do while cooking a meal and takes less time 
great for ice cream and a hit with preschoolers we use these for everything berries nuts raisins yogurt ice cream my nephew loves them for his chocolate chips annie s bunny crackers raisin and blueberry mixes and frozen berries and of course ice cream they re ideal for smaller portions they re easy to clean and dishwasher safe 
pleased i especially like the size of these corn holders they are easy to hold on to for small children and people that have difficulty holding objects in their hands i plan on ordering some for my friend that has difficulty gripping the small cob holders 
piece child set i got this set for my grandson for thanksgiving dinner because he loves to use the type of silverware that grownups use he loved it he s just months but he felt so special of course we had to watch him carefully since he is still very young but he tends to eat at the table and doesnt play that much the flatware was such it blended well with my daughter s flatware 
makes my every day fry pan useful but my all clad ltd fry pan is my most used pan while this fry pan lid fits the pan it doesn t seal as well as it should the bottom lip is very shallow and is smaller than the diameter of the fry pan i need to be careful to put the cover on properly i compared this fry pan lid to my all clad saut pan lids since the all clad saut and fry pans both have flared lips and the saut lids have larger and more squared bottom lips that closely matches the pan opening than this fry pan lid i will keep this lid but if there is the chance that all clad listens they have a chance to get up to five stars 
love these ramekins ! can t live without them ! i ordered of these corelle abundance ramekins and wondered just how much use i would get out of them well after months they are still wonderful ! i use them almost daily for little snack bowls and all kinds of neat ideas when we have guests over each one gets a bowl for baked beans and with hamburgers they are perfect for mayo mustardpicklesrelish the possibilities are endless ! i ve even baked little custards in them and they are perfect ! can t live without them fast shipping great price a 
delonghi portable radiator heater arrived in great condition as indicated in the directions there was a slight burning smell the first time i used it i haven t had that smell since easy to use programmable timer and temperature settings a great way to heat up a room instead of the whole house 
great product this product saves me money on expensive vet bills because it works better than treatments i had received there zymox takes about a week to work with one or two treatments a day it has had the same effect for my sister s dog who had had recurrent ear infections i have also used the spray for skin infections with the same rate of success 
absolutely great i have a number of booklites different vendors different styles some ac adapter some straight battery cheap to higher prices and this one is the best the brightest the one i will most often use it is connected to adapter and kept near computerat all times i am careful with such items don t expect any problems most booklites are not meant to be manhandled 
very pleased after having read the positive comments i purchased the f from amazon and it was delivered this week i tried it today and i m very pleased with the results even though my den just needed to be refreshed i was amazed to see how dirty the water was i had brought home a bissell with a lot of bells and whistles but the amazon comments were very negative so i returned it the only negative comment would be that the writeup in amazon is not correct there was no bare floor attachment in the box i had to order one from the hoover store but that has nothing to do with the performance of the machine 
great soup mugs product was great and was just what i ordered would use the site again 
really nice i am very impressed with this dog bed it is very thick and has extra padding the cover does come off for cleaning the zipper is well hidden the bed is also very in style for those hip puppies 
great skillets these are just great and the price sure is right the large skillet is deep and great for frying about cheaper then the cheapest place i found i love them and you will to 
best for the price i found this toaster on sale at amazon they were clearing out the previous model year the toast is a little uneven being more brown on the top than the bottom but overall it s well worth what i paid ! the metal warming tray on the top comes in very handy for reheating biscuits or muffins 
furi knife review the knives are perfect just what my husband the cook wanted for christmas they came in a timely manner and are in perfect condition 
worth every penny it isn t often that i find something so inexpensive that performs to my expectations while you do have to scrub it thoroughly after each use since it is bamboo it does exactly what it promises to do we use it frequently and it has held up admirably 
the most wonderful pillow ever i ve been looking for a foam pillow remembering as a teen i had one and loved it i never can find a good pillow my neck hurts my tmj would get worse or my ears would be sore i have had a very hard time finding a good one and was thrilled when i found this on amazon latex foam pillows are far superior in comfort to the popular memory foam which i think is so uncomfortable i mean it smooshes down and stays there how is that support latex foam on the other hand is light but so supportive it s springy its gently lifting you up anyway i ve had it for about a week and slept better than i have in years i absolutely love it ! also i can t believe how fast i got it when i ordered it it was out of stock and i chose free shipping had it in a few days wow ! thanks amazon ps the latex smells a little funny at first but the smell was completely gone within a few days 
nice soft towels these towels are soft and maintain the same color after several washes will buy them agai 
round cuisinart prepboard these are my favorite cutting boards cuisinart makes cutting prep boards round square and rectangle i bought them in a set all together i use at least one everyday they are dishwasher safe so clean up couldn t be easier and they will not dull your knives absorb odors or collect bacteria they are all slightly raised around the edge so liquid will not spill on your counter perfect for tomatoes or anything else you are chopping i actually just ordered a second rectangle one you can even use them for outdoor serving fruit cheese etc highly recommended ! 
ltd is the absolute best this cookware is without peer i know i have been using my first ltd pan since and have purchased many others since that pan still looks nearly new ltd cooks better than anything else and cleans like a dream the unfortunate dissatisfied person that put this cookware into a dishwasher simply did not read or heed the care instructions provided by all clad there is absolutely no reason to ever even think of putting an ltd or any fine pan into a dishwasher and even though this person has damaged the appearance of this pan its use and cooking performance have been unaffected any cooked on food can be removed without effort by simply soaking it with soap and warm water the exterior is best cleaned with a paste made of barkeepers friend and water applied with minimal elbow grease and a cloth this will remove all traces of oil or grease residue just like all clad recommends finally i believe that with a minimum of reasonable care ltd cookware will provide a lifetime of daily pleasurable cooking experience and is worth every single penny of its cost all clad guarantees it in writing 
i love it i think this griddle skillet combo is fantastic i use mine almost every day the only problems that i have encountered are once i dropped it while putting it away and part of the plastic base broke off this has made it more difficult to pick up but it still works fine and it was an accident also the nonstick coating has been scratching lately it does get a lot of use but i was hoping that it would last longer i am planning to buy another one though 
deep fryer given as a christmas gift to my daughter she was very happy with the product stating it was better with cooking times than her last fryer the well was deep enough to cook a family of five enough chicken at one time 
good but a little mis sized i bought this two years ago i probably use it once a month for baking even though it s non stick i had purchased a silicone baking mat since it allows the pan to last longer and cookies don t burn unfortunately i discovered that this sheet is about a half inch too narrow probably when i needed it would have been nice if the full dimensions had been listed on the product desciption otherwise it s done pretty well nothing sticks and it cleans up well except for some condensation that seems to have left brown stains that i cannot wash away 
love these pieces i love these pieces i plan on using them as decorative items when not being used to entertai 
title should read piece set we ordered the piece set hoping to receive service for four with pieces and serving pieces just like the one shown in blue instead we received the piece set which includes service for with the pieces pictured i called customer service told them that we did not receive the four serving pieces that we expected they said the computers were down could you call back later instead i emailed customer service told them that we were missing the serving pieces as well as the problem i had with calling customer service customer service sent out another piece set as stated on the shipping slip but we do not have the heart to tell them again that they sent out another piece dinnerware set updated 
great popper i think the stir crazy popper is great the only reason i didn t give the item stars is that the base cannot be washed in the dishwasher it would be nice if you could remove the cooking surface and put it in the dishwasher 
scooba amazed at how clean and polished my new wood floors looked i have been a roomba fan for years and this is a wonderful addition to my robotic clan 
great sheet set brougt this count set and a count set the count set was far superior they are soft and smooth best of all they are indeed wrinkle free wish i had brought two sets instead of the count set can t go wrong with this count sheet set 
excellent shaker i see a lot of people have leaky shakers not me mine is absolutely perfect the top strainer piece fits snugly leak free requiring just the right amount of effort to de couple it from the canister the design of the canister lip also makes it easy to attach the top to the canister the lip on some shakers makes it hard to attach the top the cap jigger also fits perfectly with just the right amount of snugness that it stays attached but also comes off easily 
sharp purchase quality knife comparably priced to same knife if purchased at williams and sonom 
improving port i was a skeptic but so many wine lovers and respected critics said riedel glasses did wonders for the tasting experience that i a port lover decided to try these now i am a believer i tasted a favorite port from my very nice scandinavian previously favorite glass and from the riedel port glass i cannot speak to the issues other reviewers have raised as to the relative quality of the manufacture but the taste was a marvel 
a decent fan for the money this fan does blow a really good stream of wind even at it s lowest setting although it does so a bit noisely it s somewhat annoying at night in one s bedroom when the fan s noise is a bit intrusive it sounds sort of like a propellor driven airplane revving up for take off although not nearly as loud i ve got another floor standing fan several years old that also blows well although not quite as brisk as the honeywell but is a good bit quieter i think that the low speed setting on the honeywell hs is somewhat higher than other fans hence the noise the fan s blade design which is supposed to increase air flow is also a contributing factor in making this fan noisier than others i believe one negative point is regarding the fan s oscillation feature there s no button for it on the remote control one has to pull push a button on top of the fan housing to activate or deactivate it while the noise factor is a slight issue it s not severe enough to cause me to return this fan it does move air around quite well and i did get this fan for a decent price directly from amazon and no shipping charge with super saver sadly at the time of writing this review the fan is only available from another company for with a shipping charge of yikes 
pretty good i really like this product my only complaint with it is that it doesn t quite fit my faucet but i like the space it allows for and it really has helped keep my granite countertops water free i recommend it as long as you can fit it around your faucet 
honeywell hz mini tower surround heater i bought this little heater because my dorm room was way too cold or way too warm during the cold weather the heater did wonders and my dorm room is a decent sized room not a really small one also since the weather is becoming really nice the fan is doing a really great job as well ! i definitely recommend this heater it is a bit loud though but once you get used to it it s really not a big deal at all i d rather have some background noise than be freezing all in all the heater provides a good source of heat 
great i bought this raclette grill to add to an existing collection i was a bit hesitant because i typically do not purchase hamilton beach products i have to say i like this machine better than my other more expensive european models it certainly is great value for money and easy to use i highly recommend it ! 
a big funnel and worth the cost this funnel is bigger than i expected and for the cost it should have been it is very nicely made with a very wide mouth and hefty material it will hold a lot of liquid if you pour too fast but is very well balanced and has not yet tipped on me like other funnels do this is probably due to it s significant weight 
dachshund delight wonderful ! made wiener dog cookies for christmas and they were a big hit even for a small dog even our real dachshund bailey wanted to try these adorable cookies ! 
fiesta periwinkle inch covered butter dish i received my butter dish in a very timely fashion very well packaged too the product is wonderful it s being used on a daily basis i am extremely happy with the product the shipper 
ladder shelf this was a christmas gift for my daughter she said that people really liked and her room mate was thinking of getting one 
model still going strong ! great espresso having worn out a capresso machine after daily brewing shots of espresso in making lattes cappuccinos etc i went looking for a more durable machine i bought an x in when it was a brand new model in stainless and it is great it heats up quickly it brews very consistently the ese thing is the best mess preventer ever separate steam temperature setting is great heats milk much faster than other cheaper consumer models machine has capacity to steam enough milk for at least tall lattes before needing a quick refill of water from the pump switch i like the simplicity and total manual operation the switches aren t labeled but there s only kind of a morning meditation for me the most important non obvious things don t leave a pod in the holder and move temperature to steam setting when you unhook the pod holder steam will instantly blow apart the ese pod which given that it is more than boiling hot will hurt plus will dry instantly on the wall use individually wrapped ese pods unless you use them all within hours of opening the tin they sour very quickly even in the freezer i am partial to starbucks pods given my household s addiction to that brand but i think that is more of a preference than a quality issue illy tastes fine but you have to use them all quickly if you serve a lot of guests the double unit x might be better with the dual temperature settings you ll spend a lot of time running water through the unit to cool the steam setting back down to brew the next batch of espresso lots of refills of the water container which is a bit of a pain to remove from the back of the machine overall a great performer after years of daily multiple use this thing is a great machine 
best ironing board i recently got my ironing board and i must tell you that is the best thing i ever had for ironing it s size is adequate for ironing my shirts pant s etc it s handy and doesnt take much space i can place it inside my closet and also take it with me on my trips i really recommend this item to anyone interested in saving space while doing your job 
amazing brew this machine made the best coffee i have had in the states the layer on top that is produced is reminiscent of the coffee i had in italy i would recommend this machine to any and everyone 
permanent filter i have a combination krups unit in white for both the coffee and expresso that is so old that i don t think they make that color any more bought this filter the day i got the machine use it almost every day i use folgers gourmet dark in this unit and with that size of grinds have no problem with residue in the pot it is as good as gold the brightness of the gold faded long ago but performance remains the same my white pot lid however is bowning with age the filter is older than my grand children and still works well hand wash don t scrub 
powerfull little heater this is a great heater i got it for my girl friend who s room is in a cold basement i never looked forward to having to endure her freezing room when i came to visit so we got this heater and now her place is like sauna compared to before i would highly recommend this heater 
pedrini black satin salad spinner the pedrini salad spinner is a nice addition to a kitchen the only problem is that the gears do get out of sync occasionally but not to the point that it is unusable it comes completely apart for easy cleaning

a fabulous burrow bed i m extremely pleased with this bed so much so that we ordered a second one as we have a large house we have a little three pound chihuahua pip the minute he saw this bed he climbed in and made himself at home he loves to go inside to rest and just have a little sanctuary away from the busy world the bed is very light weight and easy to tote around from room to room the top is very soft and collapses down to serve as a cover for your pet it s so snuggly and warm my only regret is that i m not small enough or i d crawl in and burrow down with pip too 
a great saut pan for those large portions i got my quart all clad stainless saut pan about a month ago and i ve been using it frequently i cook large batches of meatballs with it and i m impressed with how the meat does not stick how well the meat browns and how well the pan reaches temperature and returns to temperature even as i place all the meatballs at once instead of in batches like with my old calphalon quart saut pan my only suggestion to all clad to improve this pan is to replace the long handle the handle they use with the stainless line with the longer handle they use with their copper core line when the pan is quarts i notice that it is easier to handle my heavier copper core pieces than my stainless and ltd pieces when the pan is full and the longer handle should also make it easier to remove the pan from the cache rack when the lid is stored through the handle all clad should also think about putting the longer handle on the larger pieces this pan is a keeper 
great option at first motor seems to lose power after a while update ok i have had this for a couple of months now and i have started to see the problems other people have mentioned the rake is not powerful enough to take the waste to the disposal container and i end up scooping it like a normal litter i also purchased the larger size at the same time and that one has not had this problem either that one has a different component or the quality control of these and deviations in production make the power behind the motor really variable depending on which unit you get buy the small size at your own risk i would downgrade this to a star at this point but they don t have that option once it s submitted previous review i used to have the old model over years ago when they first came out but the rake was not detachable and made cleaning very difficult one of my cats is very picky about her litter and i decided to give this new model which easily detaches for cleaning a try i have had it for a week with no problems and this with cats i have left the old litter boxes just in case but they seem to prefer this for the number ones i think they like deeper fill for number twos which is one negative you can only put in the litter about inches deep so far no problems with the rake getting stuck although i think i might get a mega sized one next since it seems a little short where they are always going right at the very end in the corner 
christmas spode candle holder this is truly a beautiful piecethe sister who gets it will be thrille 
durable and functional t fal is a unique non stick treatment that out performs and outlasts all others the pan heats evenly and does not warp like inferior pans 
i am real happy with this oven this little toaster oven gets the job done for me i think the quality is a little bit better it is a little deeper making it a little bigger and the tempeture is more consistant than the other units in it s price range i am still looking for the right setting on the tempeture and once i find it i will most likely leave it there i think it will end up somewhere between and below that takes to long and above that setting the food tends to get a little over cooked on the outside one thing that concerned me was the safety instructions which i always read they do not want you to use aluminum foil or any non proctor silex cooking trays in this unit i always use aluminum foil and it does not seem to cause any problem perhaps they are just covering for themselves in case something goes wrong because you never know what sort of crazy stuff people are going to put into their ovens this is the only thing that concerns me otherwise the little oven is working out real good i think it will last us quite a while usually we get rid of them because they get to dirty or get a little old looking more then it is a problem that they wear out or break the last one cost us about and lasted almost a year this one cost a little more but i am sure it will last longer we have had expensive confection ovens that cost well over but i decided to save my money because this one gets the job done and does what we need it to do esp with the extra inches of depth this is a nice sized little unit 
quality product this is a great curtain it s listed as a liner but i use it as the shower curtain itself it s heavier than most and not stiff so it hangs really well the ring holes have metal gromets so it will last without the holes tearing this curtain also resists the cloudy water deposit film that ruins most curtains a great quality product 
fun and easy i purchased this for my little guy when he had throat surgery and i enjoyed more than he did ! he just doesn t like anything that s different and it wasn t smooth and creamy like ice cream i look forward to using it again this summer it is also easy to create sugar free recipes so everyone can enjoy 
silicone grip is excellent i don t know why someone hasn t made a non slip pot holder before but what a great idea used it during christmas and it works great 
smaller than it looks which is better i purchased this as a gift for my son who loves anything dipped in chocolate he had his eye on the much larger fountains i wanted something smaller that he could use without making a big mess i also did not want pounds of chocolate melted at once this little pot is perfect for that reason you melt cups of chips or whatever type of chocolate you want this will allow you to dip over pounds of strawberries and numerous pretzels from one batch because of it s size and ease of use it has been pulled out several times already i highly reccomend this to anyone who is looking for a smaller chocolate fondue pot think of it as a mini crock pot as that s what it reminds me of most 
good vacuum great bargain no these do not come with the accessories but they are good vacuums i purchased a eureka a year ago which is virtually identical to these s except for the color yellow instead of maroon it is the best vacuum i have ever had it is really good at picking up pet hair after a year of use it performs like it was brand new these refurbished vacuums show signs that they have been used on the wheels and scratchs here and there but they are cleaned up the filters are new the brush is spotless you really can t go wrong since they come with a one year warranty replacement filters for these vacuums are almost half the cost of this refurbished you have to put the handle on which is easily done by two phillips screws the vacuum comes with extension devices for getting into hard to reach places and a replacement belt 
cute cat toy this is one of the only cat toys my cats will actually play with often they seem to prefer cat toys which you wouldn t think of as toys take for instance the tops of milk bottles or the random sighting of a blind cord you just never know what is going to catch a cats attention this butterfly is one of the best cat toys i ve found it crinkles like a paper bag but it is a durable piece of crinkly plastic in each wing in the center there is a ball of catnip and some filling so far this toy has held up miraculously well and i ve even seen our cats toss it up in the air and pretend it is some bug they are chasing rather amusing for even more fun dip this toy in a bit of fresh catnip therebeccareviewcom 
awesome awesome awesome awesome the money tree arrived today on time it was a gift to me i opened the box and couldn t believe how perfect this tree was i m going to have to purchase some more of these soon especially for the holidays the roots on this smaller tree are as nice as the roots on a bigger tree thanks 
silicone baking mat i absolutely love this product it is very easy to use and clean food wont stick to the pan any longer which makes my life so much easier 
not bad as with everything i went on a search of all mug warmers in the universe before buying this one i found a universal complaint of all mug warmer reviewers of any brand was doesnt get hot enough especially the usb models i think the manufacturers walk a thin line between doesnt get hot enough and setting the house on fire initially i tried putting a cold cup of coffee upon my new mr coffee and was disappointed in the warmer s ability to heat up an already cold cup of coffee tried both metal and ceramic mug the good news is that if you put a fresh hot cup of coffee right from the coffee maker onto the burner that it does a pretty good job in keeping it hot from that point i review this as satisfactory performance and give extra credit for its slim and sleek design 
crate mat has worked well with the crate we purchased to go with it wipes clean easily 
heavy duty bottle opener and stylish too this is the lexus of the bottle opener world ! very heavy duty lovely stainless steel business end and pretty shiny handle in the color of your choice ! what more could you want this is a substantial piece of equipment won t get lost in the crowded utensil drawer this is not a space saving item ! so don t get it if you are short on utensil space this opener has considerable heft and grabs hold of bottle tops easily if you want your bottle top popped this would be the one to go with 
rd cute little pudge looks just like the charactor from star wars i bought a new stove and it gives one little buzz and then stops i was burning too many cookies so i bought the kitchenaid timer after years of plastic junk i am very happy to have a quality timer it is completely enclosed with no crevices so you can pick it up with your gunky hands and just wipe it off when you re done it has an ingenius way of activating but as soon as you get the hang of it it becomes second nature it rings long and loud which makes me happy 
very basic starter kit we gave this small tank stars because of its construction ease of handling and cleaning however since it holds only gallons it is not suitable for large fish or lots of fish keep the number and or size of fish to a definite minimum it comes with a small pump and air stone and utilizes an undergravel filtration system it has a light but does not come with a heater it s certainly better than just a plain bowl for keeping your fish this would be good for a beginner or child as it has a small footprint and is acrylic not glass and is not too heavy to handle for easy cleaning we use it as a temporary holding tank for new fish before introducing them to our larger aquarium and if one of our fish should get sick or need to be quarantined this would make a suitable temporary home for him for easy observation and is easy to clean out to avoid contaminating any other fish that may call it a temporary home in the future marineland com has some good articles on keeping fish in small tanks this tank will suit your needs if you keep its limitations in mind 
unbeatable the same as you see on many of the food network shows it is very stable and heavy funny that a block of wood was one of the best packed items that i ve ordered from amazon cookingcom it s not something that you put away until you need it plan on leaving it out and using it all of the time 
serves its purpose maybe i got a different bread box than the other reviewers i ve had mine for at least or years now it s used a lot and still looks brand new mine is very solid and doesn t appear flimsy at all it seems to keep the bread fresh the only problem is sometimes i forget that i have bread because it is hidden in the bread box overall i love polder products have a white trash can too and think they re worth the money 
great product i just bought this one a month ago its work fine and take care of my hung sqft living room the timer funtion is best you can break it by min cycle on off for more that times i am satisfied 
scooba dooba we were so pleased with our roomba that we bought the scooba it arrived in perfect condition it looked brand new i couldn t tell it was refurbished ! the scooba is my favorite helper ! i move the chairs in the kitchen and it mops and dries it all it does a great job i am a meticulous house keeper and no one wears their shoes in my house but i run the scooba twice a week and it always picks stuff up ! we couldn t be happier with the little robots we ve added to our home ! we suggest them to everyone we practically treat them like pets 
works just fine i got this to pick up cat litter and that it does plus more the handle stays on just fine if you bother to read the instructions that come with it as a bonus i love the way it picks up all sorts of crumbs and stuff off my kitchen floor seems to work well on low pile carpeting also i find it very easy to empty the bins it s a quick and quiet way to clean up i do feel like i m turning into my grandma though 
wamsutta cotton luxury gingham flannel standard sham maple really nice quality at a great price 
good attractive product this is a good attractive and solid wine rack assembly was a bit more trouble and time consuming than you might expect and assembly instructions could be better but assembly was not all that bad in the end for one this size i am very happy with it 
brita filter this is the second filter brita that i bought the first one slips off the tap after more than years of usage i m happy with brita system i m planning to use it in the future as well 
for agressive chewers still the best item out there for agressive chewers that doesn t mean your dog won t eventually manage to get it ripped apart but it does take longer than anything else out there much better than the orca toys which only take minutes to destroy 
perfect for my needs when purchasing the sharp warm toasty i knew not to expect great cooking power either as a toaster oven or microwave i m a single guy living in a small apartment and this product does about what i expected and meets my needs granted the microwave wattage isn t all powerful at w and the toaster oven section tops out at degrees but again it is ok for me i use the microwave for reheating or light cooking and the toaster oven gives me the crisping and toasting power a microwave can t i have to say that i rarely use all the myriad of buttons i think it is more complicated than necessary really i generally just hit plain old microwave or bake and select my time if you are looking for a space saver and are not expecting to create big meals then it is a nice product my one complaint though many love it is the brushed aluminum look to me it is a fad like the avocado and brown refrigerators of the s plus it is a pain to keep clean looking 
best knives ever these knives are the sharpest i ve ever used and also quite comfotable to handle well worth every penny 
bought it for looks i love this coffee maker but i don t drink coffee my husband does i bought it for the hot water spigot i love love it ! i drink hot tea all day long and it is so convenient to have the spigot however the main reason i purchased this waring pro is because it looks commercial professional and very sleek on a counter top 
great for cleaning up in between vacuumings i bought this sweeper to sweep my basement carpet which is dark in color and shows every bit of fuzz it does a reasonable job cleaning transforming my carpet from does she ever vacuum to oh she must have vacuumed yesterday it doesn t get all the fuzz and crumbs but it does what i d expect from a sweeper it is also much lighter than my vacuum so i m much more likely to use it my three yearold daughter enjoys using it too she insists on sweeping her own room i won t complain the main thing i ve learned is that because the handle slides together it will not consistently support the weight of the sweeper head this means that if you pick it up or suspend it by the top of the handle the sweeper will probably fall off so pick it up near the sweeper it stays together fine when actually sweeping 
if you only buy one toy for your dog this is absolutely hands down the best toy we ve gotten for our dogs we own three sets of these in varying sizes because the balls are plush they will wear out this is not for your destructive chewers our dog plays with the colored balls at least hours a day before leaving for work pop a couple of treats inside and you re out the door with less anxiety while they nose out the snacks 
wonderful sheets good price these sheets are extremely nice and i am very pleased with them they fit my older mattress well but are made so they would also work for a deeper pocket they do wrinkle some when washed but still remained soft great value for the price and i would definitely buy these again 
love our vt shark i absolutely hate to vacuum and anything that postpones it is great in my book most vacuums are so loud and heavy that i hate to drag them out every time crumbs are dropped on the floor we also have a cat that likes to make a mess this product is an extra help around the litter box this product is very light and easy to use the handle swivels with ease so you can get things at an angle and the base isn t too tall to fit under the couch i have been using mine for about months and have yet to have a problem with it 
customer satisfaction was no surprise here we saw the other good reviews in addition to being attractive we like the weight of the tablecloth it is not sliding all over because it has some substance very nice tablecloth ! we might buy more of them 
low heat cooking i have had my eye on this pot to add to my collection for a long time but was avoiding the price it is on sale at the le creuset outlet this month for a veritable steal ! i bought it yesterday i own many pieces of le creuset they are indeed heirloom quality and perfect for cooking anything that needs to cook at a steady low heat they are fabulous in the oven too i will use this one for my osso bucco for sure ! find it at the outlet if you can

mattress pad i really love this mattress pad it is easy to wash dry and better yet easy to put on it stretches nicely and yet keeps in place it isn t bumpy and looks like it will hold up for a long time 
what a great idea i ve only had this french press for about a week but so far i love it i keep it at work so i can avoid the swill that passes for coffee in the lunchroom i can t attest to the mug s leakproof ness since i don t actually travel with it but it is very convenient to be able to brew and drink from the same cup the stainless steel mug does a nice job of keeping coffee hot for a long time this is worth the extra money over the plastic french presses definitely 
perfect for a smaller bedroom this works great it s quiet it does take a while to get warm but when it does it maintains the toasty ness i wouldn t recommond it for a huge room or a living room area but works great at night in my bedroom it s not super warm but an oil filled radiator isn t supposed to be 
perfect for a meal serving this plate is perfect for serving a nice amount of food in the center of the table or for a larger single meal for one person very sturdy but not overly heavy the sango gold dust set has been very nice ! amazon com is the only place i can find the accesories for this set at a reasonable price and most of them you cant find in the store 
a must have for your puppy this washable cedar bedding fits in the pet gear home n go soft sided pet crate and the manufacturers really should have included it with the crate don t buy the crate without also purchasing this necessary padding the combo makes a great starter home for your new puppy 
my new favorite kitchen toy my then bachelor husband purchased a george foreman small grill about years ago because he loves steak i recently purchased this item as he threatened to fire up the big black beast outdoor gas grill in our back yard ! the new hamilton meal maker express is without doubt my favorite new purchase as my husband is a steak perfectionist it is imperative to experiment a little and then not to overcook by leaving the top grill down in order to keep the steaks warm as they will overcook other than that i just trim the steaks spray some olive oil on the grill rub on some good steak seasonings and brush on some kitchen bouquet for looks and grill away now i have perfect steaks and no mess at all love it love it love it thanks vj 
strong and pretty these were my first martini glasses i purchased i chose these because of the bargain and the look they are both sturdy and beautiful and i love using them when entertaining cheer 
a must have for serious ice cream consumers i don t know how many spoons my husband bent while he was scooping his gourmet ice creams nevertheless i never really considered buying an ice cream scoop or spade afterall a spoon was good enough for my parents so why not for us however tennis elbow set in and my spouse needed something that would allow him to dig into the hardest ice creams i needed something to round out an amazon order so that i qualified for a discount and voila this ice cream spade was the answer to both our needs we love it it s sturdy well made and we re thrilled with this accidental purchase that turned out to be an absolute necessity 
great durable dinnerware i have a thing for red dinnerware and have owned many different styles brands including emerilware waechtersbach fun factory and emile henry couleurs the emile henry doesn t chip or scratch and is so durable ! we have children who aren t the kindest to my beloved red dishes and these really stand the test more than any other brand that we ve tried highly recommended ! 
almost up to par i like everything about the mighty mite except it doesn t glide smoothly along the floor it s easy to use as far as the hose attachments and the weight of the canister 
easiest furniture to put together my husband and i just bought of the santa fe pieces i have been putting similar furniture together for years this is by far the easiet ever to put together the directions were easy to follow everything lined up perfectly and the quality is wonderful 
perfect for travellers the smallest iron i ve ever seen but it works as well as the big ones i travel a lot for work and this is a life saver 
really love this set i m not a professional cook by any means but i got this set almost a year ago and i really enjoy it if you buy it i would recommend also purchasing some bar keeper s friend cleaner and some copper polish i ve been able to keep my set looking great i even requested and received a pot rack for christmas just so i can display them it really hasn t taken much time or effort to clean them and keep them nice i usually use just soap and water and then the bar keeper s friend every few washes nothing major the copper needs to be polished every few washes but it s really easy just put the polish on a rag and wipe rinse and done i can honestly say i don t have any complaints 
lenox butterfly meadow creamer this is a beautiful piece the porcelain is thin and appears delicate but is heavy duty enough for the dishwasher 
wsthof under cabinet swinging slot oak knife block it is a great product it cleans up the counter space i m buying some for christmas gifts 
forget the cork i understand that the cork product itself effects the wine taste however replacing it with these items for just a few days does no harm they are easy to use clean store and saves tons of time trying to squeeze the oversized cork back into a bottle 
funny functional received this item a couple of weeks ago it s hysterically funny although my ex husband doesn t think so the knives are nice quality and you just can t beat the feeling of satisfaction when you shove one back in it s place ! bigger than i thought it was going to be but i m o k with that everyone who has seen it goes nuts for mne this was a great buy 
fabulous sheets fabulous sheets great price and the quality is excellent purchased them for my granddaughters they love the color 
excellent my cat loves to play with this toy and so do i it comes with catnip which adds some energy to my cat but as a human i have to take something my doctor gave me great invention 
no drips these are a great hostess gift when you attach to a bottle of wine no drips of red wine on the table when you use them 
it works the spray has helped a lot forget the plug in diffuser our boy cat has been spraying marking because of outside animals so when we spray this on the doors it deters him the key is to spray every night and every morning and to hit every spot where he might spray under windows etc also recommend rescue remedy drops in the cat s food or water or behind their ears together with the feliway it s the only thing that has worked dont do more the drops at a time 
henckels vs wusthof i m sure by now you re confused by which brand you should choose is it the henckels or the wusthof santoku if that isn t your dilemma skip on down to the next reviewer i just got the santoku for a steal of a price and that is why i went for this over the wusthof which goes for more classic hollow edge i was looking at the wusthof for over a month and was completely impressed w the feel and balance i think the henckels still comes in just below the wusthof there are hundreds of other knife manufacturers in solingen germany it s only that henckels spent tons of money on global marketing back to the knife once i got home i quickly dug for a carrot tougher to chop and a cucumber i tried to chop the carrot like i was banging on a drum and it chopped fine as far as the traditional knuckles out cutting technique it worked fine my only advice for you is to definitely try out both knives and look for the most comfortable you ll notice that one may have a heavy heellighthandle feel to it vice versa it is all preference i actually got kind of tired chopping the carrots b c thealso keep in mind the hollow edges on the knife really don t make a difference if anything it s an aesthetical bonus so try out the non hollow edged ones it may be a few s cheaper also keep in mind the difference between the pro s quotstarquot and quotstarquot knives are the handles i didn t like the quotstarquot knives b c of the ergonomic handle anyone can tell you that you re not supposed to wrap your hands around the whole handle instead you should be using your thumb and index to grip the finger guard bolster so thus the pro s is a good pick but i m still going to give the star rating to the wusthof classic quot santoku 
the mercedes of toasters i originally placed an order with etronics through amazon but after wks and the product had still not been sent i cancelled the item to date which is i still have not received a full refund i purchased this item at sears and it is the best of the best in toasters this product that marketplace has on amazon is a sore spot with me like i stated weeks after payment and the item was still not even sent out and then i am informed it won t be received before christmas and i never received my back from the seller etronics so when all else fails you go to a store and you purchase it for the same amount and i know that was luck but be leary of this company because they ignore all of your emails and then they don t refund your money in full i am still trying to get my money back 
good item i really like the design they are easier to take out than the square design when you place them on the fridge you place one faceing one way and the other one the other way and well never compleatly full or else then its a bit dificult to ake them out the only thing i don t like much is the material that is made of its not too resistant 
stunning this maxxima night light is nothing less than stunning ! i had high expectations but eventually it surpassed them it provides very nice and powerful enough light it is very cheap to operate and the price is great i think that this is one of the best purchases i have ever made definitely take advantage of this offer 
great looking and nice to embroider on these look very nice expensive and feel nice i embroidered on them for gifts and they came out beautifully you can see the embroidered towels on my personal site update i ve since ordered several of the other brands in the same price range and they can t compare to these for the price it s a very good value and i plan on purchasing other colors as well as more of these i should have given them five stars 
yogurt maker i got this as a gift because i have always wanted to make my own yogurt what a great gift since i got it almost a month ago i have make almost gallons of yogurt i make at least batch a day and sometimes batches a day we like to go for the longest setting and it has never gotten too tart or bitter like i have heard some say yogurt can get we have nice thick creamy yummy yogurt thanks so much for offering such a great product 
amazing sheet pan this was the first non nonstick pan that i bought and it has converted me i use this more often than any other pan in my kitchen if you want to make biscuits or scones and you don t want the bottom to burn you must use one of these 
i m cookin fer a livin and picked up of deez bad lil sauce pans for work and they perform as well as my solid copper mauviel quick heat transition and holding easy and quick to clean i must add that this adonized finish requires extra care not as much as copper but more than mc or stainless allclad but i don t mind i like ltd and i have pieces at work now im shoppin for a full set at home now mojo z for these rugged performers only because the finish requires extra car 
fantastic sharpener we bought this particular sharpener because it was rated the best electric knife sharpener by cook s illustrated magazine we are extremely happy with the product and what it has done for our knives

excellent relatively low tech cheap way to do co this product works well producing co relatively easily and cheaply compared to having a pressurized co canister and regulator etc high tech set up be sure to educate yourself about co in fish tanks it s good for plants but too much could be bad for fish for example i operate an airstone when lights are out at night only this diffuses the co which is not needed by plants in the dark and plants are not producing oxygen in the dark put air pump and airstone on a timer you need to learn the basics of co injection even for this simple system if you do you will have no problems only great plants i have only small fish under inches in my gal planted tank not one fish has ever suffered as a result of co fertilization but the plants grow much much better i see no reason why a diy yeast baking powder solution would not work will be going to this for the price you get all you need to get started to make your plants look great ! 
beautiful honey server i love this honey pot the design is dainty but the pot itself is really good sized a beautiful accompaniment to the matching tea set

great cap i received this for my birthday and i must say i haven t had a problem with it it s a lot of fun especially hearing the pressure steam froth the milk ! it did leak on me once the first time i used it but i did not tighten the two halves together as best i could when i did tighten the two halves i had no problems and it made great coffee i m excited to see how it seasons up and the better coffee it is supposed to make the more i use it 
a great product my son desperately loves anything star wars but being as he is only we limit him on what he can have the galactic heroes collection is wonderful the comforter is soft washes up nice and really cute ! i wish i had had this stuff when i was a kid 
after two weeks i m learning to roast coffee with i roast after a few hours on the internet reading reviews and learning about roasting i purchased the i roast i ve done at least batches so far the machine is functioning fine but i m learning something with each new batch i ll tell you my impressions so far the machine is attractive and quite easy to learn how to use it is a bit noisy but i knew that before i bought it it has a round wire ring above it which makes it quite easy to vent off any smoke i got a metal degree elbow made for clothes dryers and vent right out a window by attaching this elbow to the top of the machine i ve learned the key to roasting is watching the beans while roasting look for the color you want this machine is glass sided so it s easy to see the beans if you can t monitor the color each batch would be a guess at the product you ll learn which color beans you like the most there s a button you push to see the roasting temp at any given time it seemed to read low for what i had set i ve since read on the net that this machine s inner temps might be hotter than the number reads it s not too important if you re getting the roast you like but you have to watch it and guage results cleaning the chaf afterwords only takes a few seconds it s really easy and no work at all as i get the roasts i like the programable option is really nice i can repeat it later if i want to the i roast cooling cycle is automatic and easy from what i ve read this is really important after this minutes cycle the beans are almost room temperature and easy to remove from the glass drum i put the beans into an open glass container for breathing for a day before grinding overall performance is great i can t comment on long term durability but so far i m really pleased i d recommend this machine to others wb 
works fine no problems whatsoever i m not sure why there are several negative reviews for this vacuum it has a great price works well on my carpets and floors and is very easy to use what s not to like bottom line i would not hesitate to buy another s if i needed another vacuum cleaner 
wonderful set but cup handles not large enough i ordered two sets one in green and one is white because i like the mixed and matched look the cups are large but the handles are very small even for small hands the rest of the set is great very sturdy and large 
best money i ve spent for the kitchen in years i have owned a variety of cookware from cast iron skillets to fancy name porcelain pots almost all have frustrated me to some extent but to be fair i am not a lighthanded chef in the kitchen i thought long and hard about how to get the best value for replacements out of a limited budget i dreamed of big dollar brands made from stainless or copper but i had to be reasonable one day in desperate need for a new teflon skillet i noticed a farberware millennium non stick on sale at a local shop and i liked the feel of it i took it home and liked it enough to buy an omelet pan a few weeks later a year plus on i needed a more comprehensive rennovation of my cookware and my experience and research led me to this stainless millenium set i couldn t be happier with my purchase the feel is substantial but not too heavy for slinging around the kitchen soft touch eases the burden too it heats extremely well quickly and evenly on my electric stove i handwash the new set but even my teflon millennium pans look pretty darned good after repeated dishwasher cycles in hard water for new and experienced cooks on a budget i strongly recommend the millennium stainless 
works perfectly i use it over my bedsheets to keep them clean and dry when my slobbery lab uses my bed as hers works just great stays put even over a quilt and washes well 
best one out there i can t say i ve literally tried or tested every counter top buffet range there is but this one s construction is clearly superior to all competitor s products i hesitated broil king who are they sounds like some cheap discount store brand but i bought due to the all steel construction because all the others made largely out of plastic seemed seriously cheesy to me this unit is genuinely solidly built out of all metal nicely chrome plated with nice quality controls it works well to boot like a good quality stove top you really get a full range heat control i use mine at holiday time when my gas range is suffering from no vacancy this will gently warm things without burning when set at low a true test of the quality of the unit cheaper units look like they have full range controls but in fact you get off and screech thanksgiving can be ruined if your mashed potatoes warming on your extra burner burst into flames because the low setting was mostly wishful thinking on the manufacturer s part an excellent unit a bit of an investment but definitely worthwhile i only use it twice a year but will never regret it 
big bold and beautiful when these mugs arrived i was surprised to see how gorgeous they are the color cobalt the glaze the shape the weight the generous handle all perfect ! they even fit under the spout of my senseo coffeemaker great mugs i love them ! 
memory foam topper without the common problems i bought this as a gift for my mom so i cannot comment on what it is like to sleep on however when i began looking around for a memory foam mattress topper i encountered a huge variety of products prices and problems associated with them primarily toppers which didn t fully expand when released from the rolled and squished manner in which they are shipped and toppers with an unpleasant odor that never went away and frequently caused the users headaches i had almost decided that this type of mattress topper was just an unreliable product but after reading the previous reviews from amazon customers on this product i decided to give this one a try knowing i would be able to return it if it didn t work out it is exactly as described ! it looked terrible when opened up but had fully expanded and was perfect within two hours and has no unpleasant odor at all ! if you are considering a memory foam topper this is the one 
bark control collar my dog is the nices dog ever since i put the collar on him yes i took a couple of days for him to realize he was going to get it everytime he barked but it was all worth it 
outstanding value for the low price these are top notch ! the color is rich the weight feel of the fabric is very rich i have had mine since january so they have been washed many times without any fading or obvious wear issues 
nice sheets these are great sheets they are comfortable sturdy and very well made the colors are also vibrant and there is an almost satin feel to them definitely a quality purchase 
gorgeous durable beautiful wicker hampers the best and what a special price paid anywhere else you will have to pay at least bucks thank you amazon 
good product my husband loved european coffee and this has allowed him to brew very fresh european style coffee the larger press is used when he is at home and the smaller when he is on the go they have been proven well worth the cost ! which is a great deal ! 
very impressed the steamer works exceptionally well cleans with almost no effort but if you have big jobs you might like a steamer with the ability to hold a larger capacity of water 
light wedge saves marriages i love the light wedge ! it will save marriages if one spouse cannot sleep with the light on while the other reads ! the light wedge does not shine anywhere other than within the book it is a great and easy shape to pack as well 
happy but used a drill the desk is beautiful i chose it for the solid wood rather than laminate and the wide keyboard tray also holds the mouse my mom and i had fun putting the desk together in a couple of hours we couldn t finish the drawer because on one side panel the metal guide sticks out too far so the drawer won t fit together i m waiting for a replacement part but i m enjoying the desk with no drawer we later almost finished putting the hutch together in a couple of hours but it was missing about pre drilled starter holes so we came back to it with a drill the drilling was easy once we marked the spots with a screwdriver 
what i was looking for finally a product that will do as advertised and not rust thank you 
the best i used to put a hair band around the neck of the wine bottle to keep it from dripping along the sides with this handy gadget i threw all the hair bands away i will never have to deal with wine running down the bottle again who wants wine stains on their table cloth this is going to solve that problem i can also guarantee that once your guests see it they ll want this wine pourer too 
beautiful pattern and delicate cup teacup and saucer are even more intricate than pictured also amazon did a fabulous job with careful packaging and shipped very promptly 
so soft these sheets were everything that i hoped them to be they have been washed several times times now they have come out beautifully they will be the softest sheets that you have ever laid on terrific buy you must buy these sheets 
good source for relacements of the proline coffeemaker the replacement carafe arrived in good order and was provided by ace hardware they werem prompt with the delivery and asked if all was ok they are a caring distributor 
treat yourself you know when you get new pillows and they don t fit right and it takes a week or two before you get them to squish just right from the moment i put my head down on these feather down pillows i was home i had been nursing a feather down pillow from my childhood and i am because it was so comfy i bought other pillows but still used the old feather down one on top next to me the old feather down pillow has now gone to its reward and i am sleeping luxuriously with four of these wonderful pillows i didn t need four but they look beautiful plump and succulent on my bed i do go on ! you will not be disappointed and there is no smell the royal velvet cover feels like a fine fabric and they even come in their own individual plastic zipper tote complete with handle ! 
excellent economical pizza peel i bought this pizza peel for my son who is really getting serious about making pizzas from scratch at home and i can say that it is serving him and us very well the aluminum blade is sturdy and well sized for a pizza the handle is just about the perfect length for working in a home kitchen the materials in its construction are not exotic but the peel is very well made with the blade firmly riveted to the ferrule and the handle firmly and well crimped into the other end of the ferrule delivery was very prompt an excellent value and a welcome addition to our kitchen 
a little linty but nice overall very good deal on the pair of towels they shed after the first couple of washes but i m still glad i bought them 
great heat conduction this product is excellent when used wiht the matching quart sauce pot it conducts heat extremely well and my chocolate chips melted much faster than with other double boilers 
this is my second one my husband and i love this electric skillet this is our second one as we over used our first one it is the perfect size for cooking breakfast and yet big enough for cooking one dish suppers ! the nonstick finish is great and clean up is a breeze as you can submerse the whole thing minus the electric plug we loved this skillet so much that we searched for this one and could only find it on amazon ! i have tried another one but is was to large and took up to much space on my counter 
best cup ever best cup ever ! keeps your drinks warm for hours fits in my drink holder in my truck brews a good cup of coffee 
riedel these glasses make a world of difference in the taste of your wine compared to retail department stores amazon offers a very nice price for them 
i love this lid i owned the sheets but without the lid here are the reasons i love the sheets you can really clean it without worrying about the teflon coming off no concerns about teflon poisoning dishwasher friendly i use it for everything cookies fries meat so now that it comes with a lid i bought it the lid is especially handy if you are taking it with you ie veggie pizzas are especially easy now 
my clothes are saved i am very pleased with this product my dress shirts and pants are finally saved from touching the floor in my closet huge pet peeve of mine i also didn t realize how much more space i created in my closet now i don t have to take up the extra closet space in the guest room 
great item for the price i picked this up a few months back when the price was too low to refuse coughbucks cough and i am more than happy with it like others have said its not a big and fluffy down comforter but did you really expect to get big and fluffy king size comforter for this price anywho the reason i m here replying right now is because i keep checking back to see if i can pick up another for the same price yes i d buy another hello kim 
fabulous i really enjoy using these tidbit trays they are great when you just want to have one item on your tray they even work really well eating a bowl of cereal in bed i have a month old baby and the trays work really well to set the baby food on while i feed her i feed her in the high chair and keep the tray of food on my lap it keeps eating time much much cleaner 
hoover fold away bagless upright vacuum wonderful product fast service highly recommend this item 
i love brita i am a water fanatic and i have to have water that tastes good since it is the main liquid i drink brita is way less expensive than buying bottled water and as another reviewer said the plastic bottles can sometime contaminate the water they hold brita filters out some of those contaminates besides all that brita water tastes great i give it stars and hope that you like it as much as i do it does fill slow and when its gone you have to fill it up and wait for it to get cold and that can take forever i have one room mate and between he and i the pitcher was always empty so if you are going to get one get one that holds alot of water you will not be sorry and if you are worried about cost think about how much you spend on for bottled water i was drinking about a week and then some 
holmes hfh heater best space heater ever ! we bought ours in and it still going strong best hot air penetration into the space of any space heater we ve owned we later bought a model hfh but it s heat was not as robust as the highly recommended 
great great size which stores several loaves of bread or bagels cutting board gets stuck sometimes 
fast user friendly works just fine for my needs i use it to press my wrinklefree dockers the water container for the steam is a bit awkward to fill but once it is filled it lasts a good long time heavy duty well constructed dependable unit first package disappeared at ups when they shipped the first machine it was evidently damaged and returned back to amazon by ups probably due to the thin cardboard used for packing the replacement shipment arrived just fine and as always amazon customer service very helpful on shipping replacement while first package was still lost 
very pleased i m very pleased with this cutting board it is functional and washes well i leave it sitting on my counter at all times because it s also attractive the granite used in the product description is simply referring to the color and look of the board not the material it s made from it clearly states in the description that it s constructed of plastic material a great board for a great price 
good coffee pot but i have owned this coffee pot for a few years now overall it is good the biggest problem is that the grinding is so loud that it will wake the dead if you live in an apartment condo or townhome you probably do not want to get one of these it will wake up your neighbor 
the problem is me this tea kettle is as wonderful as everybody says it is unfortunately i unintentionally fell asleep while heating water in mine and it was ruined when i woke up i have ruined including today all but one pot i own by getting busy on my computer and forgetting water is on the stove or by falling asleep i would love to have this tea kettle with a train whistle i couldn t hear it over my central air conditioning when it came on but i am closer to the air conditioner than to the kitchen i was always alert to listen for it however until that day i dozed off i m not writing to discourage anyone from buying this i m just forewarning anyone who is like me 
solid performance excellent value this is a terrific machine amazon s price beat everyone especially with their promotional discount no sales tax and no shipping charges the oversized feed tube makes pre processor preparation much simpler as i don t have to try to fit my ingredients into a narrow tube clean up is great since everything goes in the dishwasher except the fully sealed motor base which wipes down easily and has no crevices to trap any misses messes it s quiet and efficient i only wish that there were more outlets hear me amazon that sold the accessory discs and blades that fit this processor so there would be some competition to drive the price of these items to a more reasonable level overall i am highly satisfied and happy i spent a little more and got the best 
obsession harley has always shown a polite interest in toys he will dutifully chase the tennis ball for a few minutes before settling down for a nap one eye half open to monitor my activities in the pre badcuz era harley s main interest in life was me following me around the house sitting on his bed and simply watching me with those big brown eyes yipping uncontrollably whenever i left him in the car that was all before the bad cuz once i introduced this toy to my pound dane pitboxer mix he transmogrified into a ruthless squeaky toy killer there is no other way to describe him but obsessed my dog cares of nothing else but a red rubber squeaky toy with martian legs and two tiny pointed nipples he can t bear to look at it in my hand or in another dog s mouth he goes crazy barking and whining whenever he believes i have waited too long to throw it the bad cuz has become an addiction i fear what he might do to get more bad cuzes or what if i was throwing the bad cuz and then i tripped and sprained my ankle would harley continue to chase and play with the toy or would he run over to me in concern and lick my face i fear the former and yet i continue to give him what he wants because i have never seen my dog so frenetically wildly happy i am willing to give up being the center of harley s world because it gives me so much pleasure to see him so pleased with himself when he has wrestled the toy to the ground and commenced to squeak it to death this is the first bad cuz i have bought harley but i guarantee you it will not be the last 
good unit size and output quite adequate for a x space i m using it for yes initially it stinks but they do recommend runing it hrs outside first so no surprises efficiency hard to say whether i m saving yet the timer s fine it would be nice to have an actual temperature gauged thermostat not a number from to 
superb i have probably had twenty espresso cups in my days i like espresso cups that are sturdy with a good grip and a small saucer those doesn t fall in that category but i love them anyway i don t have to pre heat them and it is beautiful to see all the crema through the glass they hold the espresso warmer than normal cups the cups are very light weight so they feel a little fragile i wouldn t wash them in a washing machine i think 
this stuff works great we have a cat boarding business have the occasional guest that has accidents we take pride in hosting a clean environment and insist that our facility smells pleasant at all times this product works great on urine vomit you must use this product initially as your only means of cleaning soiled area if you introduce other products it will not work after all the scent is gone with this product then you can use bleach other means of disinfecting worth the money ! make certain to get the just for cats product if that s what you need otherwise the general use nature s miracle works great for dogs messes we house trained a puppy years ago ! 
ironing sleeve with an emblem patch i work for a federal agency which requires me to wear a uniform and since i prefer to do my own shirts instead of paying someone else i needed and easier way to get my sleeves ironed without leaving an impression of my emblem patches on the other side of the sleeves this item has completely solved the problem and has made sleeve ironing much easier definitely recommend to anyone with a uniform shirt 
very nice large glass jar i was searching for large glass jars to store bath salts when i discovered this anchor hocking gallon container it has proven to be perfect for the application i highly recommend it for jobs that don t require a hermetic seal the glass is totally clear and the jars are made of what feels like heavy pyrex old world quality my two examples arrived in days very well packed the service through amazon was outstanding the price was great too the best i found on the web

f q potomac md this is a wonderful product it is simple to use economical and cooks rice perfectly just add rice and water push the button down and walk away i use mine atleast times a week 
red gourmet glass yes the stem is short yes if you have a big nose it may get caught and worst of all they do come from france which is a very good reason not to buy them but that being said you will not find a more pleasant delicate glass to hold or sip from in this price range more importantly they fit into the upper level of the dishwasher their single most important attribute and if you break one or two or three no tears throw away the pieces and buy a new ones now that you cannot say about waterford 
sometimes you just want one cup this one cup coffee maker is nice if you just want one cup of coffee you must adjust the coffee to your particular taste it includes a mug and a washable filter it also includes a measuring spoon it fits most mugs 
food seems to cut itself i think this knife doesn t actually cut the food so much as it intimidates it the food looks up sees this massive wickedly sharp blade approaching and leaps out of the way at the last possible moment that s my best guess as to how this knife cuts so effortlessly or i guess it could be the fact that blade takes and holds an edge like a dream allowing the significant weight of this very large knife to just drop the blade through whatever you happen to put under it whatever the bottom line is you don t have to exert any effort to cut you basically just steer and the knife does all the work which is exactly as it should be ive had this knife for about months and use it almost daily primarily for cutting up fruits such as pineapple watermelon large papayas peaches etc cutting the rind off a pineapple does require a tiny bit of effort but otherwise even a good size watermelon cleaves itself out of the way when it sees this beastie coming the wide blade is great for transferring food from the cutting board plus it adds that much extra weight allowing the knife to do that much more of the work for you i also find the width makes it easier to keep the blade against the fingers of my guiding hand which makes me feel safer more confident the length enables you to cut through small watermelons large papayas and personal size pizzas with just one stroke sweet ! the length also means that much more curve meaning you can cut more and larger items without lifting the tip off the board also sweet if had one tiny complaint it s that the length means the tip of the knife is quite far from your hand so delicate strokes with the tip e g to cut a blemish out of a piece of fruit are a little awkward i ve gotten used to it but it s taken some practice however since a wide body knife isn t primarily designed for delicate tip work i certainly won t deduct for that i have a furi techedge pro knife sharpening system it s a great system which i love to use but i ve only had to hone this knife s edge or maybe times in months of almost daily use granted i m only cutting fruits and vegetables on a good quality bamboo cutting board still that s pretty good edge holdingyou really shouldn t buy a knife of this size or in this price range without at least holding it how a particular knife will feel in your hand is unpredictable particularly one this large and weighty but i already knew i liked the wsthof classic line so i took a chance and bought this from amazon without ever holding it and i m very glad i have it i love this knife 
nice bowls i like and dislike these bowls what i like about them is the shape and size for certain foods and for the dishwasher they are actually too small for cereal if you would like to add fruit to your cereal they are perfect for oatmeal or ice cream but too small for soup or stew they are curved perfectly to drain and rinse well in the dishwasher the depth of color is very attractive on the table 
villaware v classic belgian waffler round great product the tone of the beep is a bit annoying but it is very functional lets you know when to pour the batter when the waffle is ready to be served we have found a mix called krusteaz is very easy tasty 
absolutely wonderful i love this pan ! we have a large family and i easily fit chicken breasts in this pan at one time you don t have to cook with high heat because this pan easily distributes the heat evenly low heat is also best so the food doesn t stick clean up is really easy warm soapy water and that s it this is definitely a quality made pan i have several pieces from le creuset and know they will last me through my lifetime 
classy looking functional collar i ordered this collar because i didn t like the looks design of the kitty collars i found in the pet stores also at the time my kittens i have two were only weeks old so i was looking for a collar that would adjust with their growth i m happy to report that this collar i ordered two in different colors has been great even the vet noticed the collar and remarked how neat it is the collar looks really sharp and has a nice sized metal loop for hanging an id tag etc both kittens took to this collar just fine it was their first collar and i have been able to let the collar out a bit as they ve grown i also like the fact that there s no extra collar hanging out past the buckle the collar just forms a big loop around the kitty s neck the only issue i ve had is one of the collars is a bit hard to adjust but overall i ve been very pleased 
dirt devel great product great value for the price and does exactly as it is presented wish it had a longer cord but overall good quality product does an excellent job on all floorings i m glad i bought this item it s easy to transport up and down stairs as well 
best cat litter i ve used i am so glad i tried this litter despite the few negative reviews i saw it clumps well and does not stick to the pan even after it gets wet it is simple and convenient to clean the litter box since the litter can be flushed down the toilet we keep our litter boxes next to the toilet to facilitate regular cleaning perhaps not the best odor control but comparable to most litter i have two cats who switched to the new litter without problem i would recommend it no question 
fiestaware ounce small disk pitcher this review assumes that you like the fiestaware look this small pitcher is a nice purchase the color cinnabar is a more sophisicated alternative to the usually bright fiestaware colors but still keeps the basic look alive 
so far it s working well i ve only had the product for a short time but it s definitely making a noticeable change on the edge of my global knives i m rather impressed 
excellent for everyday i bought these wine glasses so that i could have lead free crystal for everyday use while they don t have the heavy crystal quality for example like lenox tuscany they have good clarity a pleasantly delicate construction and a nice crystal ring to them the art deco stems are not my favorite stylewise but this line was the only lead free riedel set to offer vinum bowls at the time i bought it but they have a very classy and stylish look all the same 
b d lids off i took a chance bottom line this product works as advertised ! i was hoping it would as my wife has an arthritic wrist making it difficult to open cans and jars i tried it out on a jelly jar you know how hard they are to twist off popped off like a dream if you are in the market might as well get the item that does it all instead of just opening cans for example 
it s a cast iron grille pan well it s a cast iron grille pan what else can i say about it like all cast iron pans it s quite heavy but it will also last for a lifetime or more it is also non stick providing that it is cleaned and cared for appropriately there are appropriate seasoning instructions that come with the pan since cast iron is able to reach higher temperatures than non stick cookware it makes it a great choice to cook meat when cooking outside is not an option just make sure to heat the pan for three or four minutes before using it if you re unfamiliar with cast iron cookware follow the instructions that come with it and you ll enjoy a great pan for life just remember that it doesn t go into the dishwasher 
super duper black and decker i have waited forever to buy a dustbuster i don t know why well now i do this product has exceeded my expectations it picks up great i have a dog who chews up all of her toys and leave bits and pieces of plastic and stuffing all over the place it is a lot easier using the dustbuster than taking the vaccum out all of the time this product is great 
great i love this heater it has several safety and convenience features i actually couldn t figure out how to get it working though a co worker helped the instructions weren t well written however there is an number on the bottom for customer serice i would strongly recommend it s a great value 
pop up hamper this hamper can easily hold a week s worth of clothing and bedding for two people the casters makes it easy to roll to the laundry room 
great little vac this is a great all around small inexpensive vac for apt or to use with an upright it comes with tools for small spaces and has a long hose and cord it has great suction and cord and tools store on the unit my only complaint is that the tube and tools may leave black marks on the walls if you are not careful 
wow my sister bought this for my yr old son for christmas it is great even when it doesn t get something right on the nose it s very close the adults had just as much fun as the kids and we all fought over it a great toy for not alot of money i always like those !

purple sheers the sheers are excellent ! the only problem with this order is that there was a mix up in the initial shipping and i received black sheers instead of purple sheers however after a concise email the company quickly took care of sending me the correct sheers and a return label at no cost thank you for taking responsibility for the mistake and working efficiently to correct it ! 
great so far i bought this locally to replace an old rival deep fryer that just quit the first one i brought home had a broken brace on the heating element it was exchanged with no problem and the second has no apparent defects after reading all the negative reviews i wanted to use it at least once before the day exchange period was up like others i went looking for this model because it was one alton brown liked the features he liked were the large oil capacity immersion element with high wattage thermostat filter ease of cleanup and stainless construction all make it a desirable machine euro pros iffy quality control makes it something of a gamble i put liters of oil in it and fried up some vegetables as an appetizer for dinner last night so far this is a great fryer i have had the presto fry daddy s and the rival this replaced this unit is much closer to a professional fryer you would find in a restaurant kitchen it heats up the oil fast and returns it to temperature very fast food comes out crispy and not greasy i am very pleased with the unit but will withold final judgement until it has proven itself durable 
riedel is the best in fine glassware i ve been using riedel for years pronounced reedul their best line is handblown austrian crystal and is called the sommelier series very expensive but peerless in quality and beauty the next line down is also very fine and is called the vinum series my white wine glasses are from this series my red wine glasses are from the overture series the magnum glasses these are just the right size the vinum can get quite large i also prefer a shorter stem which these have i thought the overture regular reds were a little too small for my taste and smell ! overture is a little more durable much cheaper but not quite as elegant still they are very nice glassware and certainly nice enough to have for fine dining and guests i would suggest you never put any riedel glassware in the dishwasher this is high quality austrian crystal and it is definitely not a good idea to do that 
flour power it is a little loud but gets the job done without making your arm tired like old school sifters 
what size is this item it looks beautiful and i want to purchase it but there is no size anywhere i don t want a small board i want a fairly large one can anyone help 
i have one to go with my original finish lodge cookware but this one didn t take any effort to season good going lodge 
great sturdy product i ve had this for several months already and it holds up very well great thick durable plastic and the suction works well for the tiling behind my kitchen sink surprisingly it has not fallen since i made sure to follow the instructions and clean the surface and allow to dry before applying the suction although it is not holding a heavy amount of items just a few sponges and a oz dispenser of soap note don t mistaken this product to being the same one as oxo good grips utensil holder white also sold on amazon when i looked closer to the product image reviews that doesn t have suctions the compartments on that would have been great for this sink basket 
very useful daily i find that i use these almost daily they basically have become my new prep bowls for small amounts nice quality easy stacking even great color will probably buy a second set 
love this knife tray it s substantial and attractive the knives are off the countertop and beautifully stored thank you 
bam ! what a pan i added this sauce pan to my cookware collection recently i was looking for stainless steel because i feel that for a saucepan this is the best option for making soups sauces etc non sticks just don t do it for me this pan looks and performs wonderfully it heats evenly and cooks sauces without any hot spots the pan has a triple bottom aluminum stainless steel and a small strip of copper which gives it a stylish look the glass lid is also a nice feature because it allows you to view your food without haveing to remove the lid this comes in handy when you are preparing rices or any other type of dishes that require the lid be kept on at all times clean up is also a breeze the pan is made by all clad but does not come with their steep price you can t beat the value emeril s cookware is top notch quality and is my favorite because it performs well and is reasonably priced 
stunning a stunning pride of place plate to present all sorts of goodies on hot or cold endless uses but looks particularly superb with a selection of breads along with the matching bean pots full of steaming soup on colder days equally stunning with a selection of cold meats or cheeses at the bbq on a warm summer s evening friends use theirs for roast chicken on sundays guaranteed to be a talking point whatever you use it for easy to clean and dishwasher safe it is hard to beat such a durable item which looks the part as well at an excellent price on amazon today check out the other colours too there is bound to be one for you manufactured using the highest quality materials and techniques le creuset stoneware offers much greater resistance to extreme temperature changes chipping and crazing the tough craze free glaze is totally hygienic it will not absorb food or flavours and is stain and scratch resistant 
easy clean up i just love this cookware dish it s functional and pretty it cleans so easily i now plan to buy more le creuset poterie cookware 
some things to consider before purchasing given the reviews posted earlier i approached this machine with some trepidation expecting difficult operation inconvenient clean up and poor juice i am pleased to say that none of this occurred i have had my juicer for weeks now have pressed over lbs of oranges and enjoyed a gallon of gloriously fresh juice it was easy to squeeze and easy to clean up however consider the following points before puchasing you absolutely must have some upperbody strength to exert the required force and control the lever action while my wife had a bit more difficulty she was able to squeeze the oranges just fine also operation may not be comfortable for left handed individuals as the lever is on the right side of the machine and your free left hand must rest on the top of the unit to prevent excessive force from jolting the machine when rotating the lever do so slowly as rapid motion can lead to spraying juice from the orange loss of control of the unit or both do not use the machine for glass of juice you ll spend less time and effort using a simple plastic pulper over a glass do not use this machine for gallon of juice or more if you re making that much juice consider an industrial automatic model and up or just get used to that juice out of the carton be sure to read the directions before using it really helps to know how all four removable pieces attach detach when cleaning up clean up is as simple as rinsing wiping with a sponge and replacing into machine really takes no more than seconds leave the machine on your counter if possible your lower back will thank you purchase good quality juicing oranges after buying oranges of several varieties from different purveyors you ll be amazed at the differences in flavor all oranges are not created equal before pressing your oranges give them a few seconds in the microwave this will result in more free flowing juice during pressing some reviewers have mentioned that pressing the oranges releases some of the volatile oils found in the rind into the juice while this is true these oils give oranges their distinctive aroma and taste and therefore improve the quality of the juice and provide some bracing acidity to its sweetness the imperfect shape of the upper and lower press molds doesn t extract all of the juice from the outer edges of the orange half we addressed this by simply moving the orange edges over the lower mold and repressing a few more precious drops will not extract as much juice per orange as an electric machine with a rotary pulper but requires less cumulative effort when doing more than a few oranges i cannot comment about the durability of the unit as i have only used it for several weeks however it is difficult to believe that avoiding overtorque using slow deliberate lever motion wouldn t reduce the probability of any cracking in the cast ironin summary this machine provides great value for the niche it was intended to serve fresh juice enthusiasts squeezing a quart or more of juice per week but not more than gallons ! with an eye for sharp design 
stress free travel with your dog my month old lab literally hangs out of the window while i m driving in the driver s seat ! i hated driving driving without my husband in my car so he could hold her her crate doesn t fit in my car so i looked for another option this seatbelt is perfect for her ! it s so easy to use and she can still stick her head and front paws out of the window and be completely secure now i m not worried about her jumping out she can comfortably lie down too i think this is a better option than the booster seat because this pulls the dog back by the chest not the neck plus you don t attach the leash so there is no risk of strangulation 
rival crock pot i love this crock pot i ve made several recipes from the enclosed cook book they came out great the best part is that the ceramic insert is so easy to clean 
a pleasant surprise first tea infuser i ve used that is the correct depth and width in an age with so many ill designed poorly made and cheap items on the market it s a pleasant surprise to purchase a product that works so well a must have for any serious tea drinker imho the best cup of tea is infused in an iron teapot with a stainless steel strainer i prefer iwachu made in morioka prefecture japan from filtered or spring water heated in copper teakettle i prefer simplex copper with pure tin liner made by hand in birmingham england but if you re making only one cup of tea the bodum yo yo is the best option 
toast comes out like it s been sunning in st tropez first let me say that i decided on this oven because i refuse to spend a lot on another toaster oven they don t live a long time except for the cuisinart and so why spend top dollar i love this oven i also purchased it at costco it was replacing my old would never buy again delonghi toaster oven and a panasonic infrared toaster oven that went right back to amazon after days the only thing that compares is the cuisinart convection toaster oven that i had it was the perfect toaster oven but a little too small for our needs if you don t need a big oven don t mess with anything else and get the cuisinart yes it takes eons to make toast in this baby way more than minutes most often between minutes it s a big oven but unlike the other reviewer my toast no matter what kind of bread turns out perfectly golden like my bread was sitting out in st tropez the rack must be in the center position and shaped like a u when looking at it from the front for the perfect slice it also can handle nearly full english muffins at one time great for big families i have also found that it will toast things one right after another without getting increasingly browner with each batch but it does get faster with each successive batch i would like having the unit interior larger from side to side it will nearly fit a x pan i mean by less than which would be great in summer to almost never use my big oven so i m not sure why the manufacturer wouldn t have gone the extra i mean it s already a huge oven might as well go for it if you are a small family or have a super small kitchen this oven might not be for you i have a small kitchen but a family that likes to eat so this oven while taking a lot of space does a lot of work for us and is worth it the bell when toast is done is not that loud so if you are in another part of the house doing something you might not hear it i have made toast pizza baked potatoes fries and chicken strips muffins cookies brownies roasted chicken and more in this oven they all came out beautiful i don t like that i can t tell when it is up to temperature for baking so i have an instant read thermometer to tell me when it is ready and yes it takes forever to get up to temp my oven temp is lower than what it reads on the digital touch screen but it has not adversely affected my baking so with those caveats i still love this toaster oven i can t recommend it for everyone but if you identify with my likes and dislikes in this review you will like this machine 
luxury features i never expected for this price never power level settings of and right on down i am amazed i think the very low settings are for drying food can you imagine being able to do dried foods yourself then quick buttons for nearly everything it ll take a while to learn all the features but even right out of the box it was just so easy to use ! all i wanted was a small simple one that wouldn t take much counterspace and never dreamed it would have all this not for this price my old microwave had just given out after years of daily use and the one thing i wanted was defrost that s all i d always used the microwave on defrost to simmer foods that needs long slow cooking with no pot watching and no chance of burning you ought to try that ! much better than on the stove and this does have defrost of course of course but so many other settings that will be even better for slow cooking then you can choose to defrost meat according to how much the chunk of meat actually weighs of all things theres a setting for that too ! never heard of that ! one more feature i especially wanted was for the light to go out when the door is open and here s why the way to make a microwave last simply forever is to leave the door open a while after each use and let it dry out then it will last for decades like my old one did but wouldn t want to leave it open if the light stayed on no so another highly desirable feature right there i just don t think a better microwave could be bought at any price period many more features aren t even listed here the more expensive ones seem to only have features i d never use anyway a built in toaster or something so why pay for that ! no if it s microwaving you re after this is just it also if you re wondering about size it says compact but holds a regular size pyrex loaf pan with room to spare as it turns or a big mixing bowl with a pretty big hen or whatever in it so that s plenty big for most people it s the design there are scooped out places in the inner walls that allow space for the rim of a bowl or a pan to turn that s why it holds so much and hey it looks nice too and is light enough that i can easily move it to clean under it yet it does feel as heavy and solid as can be my hat is certainly off to the designers ! and as always to amazon ! it got here in no time with amazon s free supersaver shipping days before i was told it would arrive i don t have a single negative to say after a week s use and every day am still discovering yet more wonderful things about it that save a busy person s time and energy as well as money thought i d let other shoppers know 
whisk good quality product twirl whisks are much better than regular whisks for making puddings soups etc that don t have chunks in the food 
tastes great but too brown this pan is very functional makes wonderful mini madeleines that are almost perfect spongy delicate comes off in one piece easily thanks to the nonstick coating heats evenly etc my only complaint is that the shell surface is too brown instead of that nice yellow golden appearance this seems to be a problem with nonstick pans in general other than this excellent pan 
handsome enough to serve at your dinning table this brush finish stainless steel water pitcher is handsome yet functional to leave at your formal dinning table the handle is big and very comfortable to pour it will holds almost a gallon of ice water there is a ice blocker to block out the ice cube from falling into the glass when you pour this pitcher is very heavy duty compare to other lower price pitcher in the stores a high quality stars product 
aerolatte great for whipping up hot chocolate my little granddaughter just loves it and so do i 
perfect for my office desk i purchased this little machine to be used on my office desk after a week of daily work day use i have no major complaints the only thing missing that would make it over the top is a thermal stainless carafe i have not had any problems with leaking from around the top or poor metallic taste which might be more attributable to one s water source we have bottled water here and i am quite devoted to my starbuck s coffee i had considered buying a permanent filter but i find the paper ones much easier to simply toss for clean up and they aren t that expensive the minute automatic off can be a blessing and a curse it keeps me from forgetting to turn the machine off but sometimes it turns itself off before i ve finished the pot but that s not a big deal as i just hit the switch to turn it on again to fire up the heat a full pot makes at least good mug servings for me and that s really all i need in the morning i am very pleased with this machine i use an old cup mr coffee machine at home which works well but i like the more straight up compact design of this one for my desk top 
dog door bell it takes a little patience to get the dog to use it at first she thought is was a treat machine but eventually she realized it meant go outside works very well 
great my daughter bought this for me for christmas she down loaded pictures of all my grandkids on it i just love it easy to carry around and you can add or detract old photos a must for anyone who likes to show off children grandchildren or pets 
ionic breeze the best i originally spent the substantial amount to purchase two ionic breeze air purifiers given my allergies and i am a smoker they were so effective i purchased a third along with another product claiming the same performance results the ionic breeze products far out perform the other products so i will continue to replace existing ionic breezes with the same should the originals become non performing cmf happy use 
so far so good we bought this to get a blender and to replace a leaky and piece of junk hamilton beach food processor we live in a cramped apartment so anything that saves us space by condensing or being multi functional is highly attractive i ve already broken the blender carafe the replacement is only but note that the plastic ring at the bottom is an extra ! it s removeable i had no idea both machines have worked well and we ve had no complaints we like to make smoothies and this has been great at crushing ice 
you light up my night i wish i would have bought the regular one instead of the paperback version i love this light i can see everything and don t get the shadows hindering my reading i prefer to read in bed and this allows me to do so without waking up dh 
professional quality kitchen tool jaccard tendermatic meat tenderizerpros professional caliber tool strong well engineered and manufactured ergonomic design handle bulges at top for good grip it s comfortable and no sharp edges protective cover slides over the blade section for storing the tool for safety the blades are only exposed when the tool is pressed down firmly against the spring loaded bottom plate note those blades are sharp stainless steel blades are replaceable tool has three blade assemblies with blades in each one see customer photos search google on jaccard replacement blade if yours get damaged it actually does make steaks and other meats more tender and opens them up for marinade to soak in cons takes longer to clean the tool if meat particles get between the blades summaryexcellent product 
absolutely gorgeous stunning set i love this pfaltzgraff dinnerware set i had purchased another piece design set from another site and i was very pleased with the quality of them i bought these when amazon had an amazing sale on them and they are just really stunning worth every single penny i paid for them if you can get this for under fifty bucks buy it you won t regret it 
just the right size and weight i burnt my last stockpot an inexpensive revereware and needed a replacement i seriously thought about buying a new full set they re always just a tad more than a single piece i m glad i didn t this stockpot is just the right size and doesn t come in any prepackaged group what i really like is the even heating and the stainless steel weight it s probably my imagination but i swear food cooked in it tastes better than before 
so pleased i came looking for another set they are heavy but elegant the best part is the design of the bottom water drains cleanly from the glasses and they come out sparkling 
seems to work within minutes of plugging this in it turned my maine coon attack cat into a pansy i can now pet is stomach without losing an arm he is much more affectionate and passive works for me 
nice weight pouring spouts wonderful i have been using many months and am very pleased i purchased the bottoms are heavy enough to use on the smooth glass cook tops without scorching the steam pouring spouts are great ! no more boil overs or losing whatever you are trying to drain down the sink the lid on the largest pot is not a good fit for any of the skillets i purchased both the and lids and additional qt pan i have not used metal utensils except for serving from the pans they did pass my usual test of all nonstick surfaces a medium pressure scrapping of a metal cooking utensil across the surface caution if you have a black glass cook top the bottoms will cause aluminum marks but not after washed the first time i made the mistake unpacking mine on top of my jenn aire black cook top i wouldn t change a thing except that i do wish the open stock lids were available with the glass inserts also as the open stock lids are not as heavy weight stainless they are about like the traditional revere sets i have used the traditional revere all stainless set for years and was very pleased to find this set much heavier and more substansial the stainless is so shiny that i do find myself being over protective so that it stays that way ! 
great frozen pizza plate my husband and i fight over this plate when we have frozen pizza a tombstone pizza fits great on this plate 
handles are delicate this is a great slow cooker but the handles on the insert are delicate one broke almost immediately 
martex diamond weave cotton king blanket nice lightweight blanket for use in the summer well made and durable 
greatest sharpening system i ve owned many sharpening devices and i have before the furi knife sharpening system used a steel to keep my chicago cutlery honed i have a set of furi knives and my old years chicago set this system completely renewed the old chicago knives and keeps the furis razor sharp well worth the money 
excellent for garlic this handle little utensil keeps your garlic nice and fresh until you are ready to use it in cooking much better than placing the garlic in the refrigerator the garlic keeper is also attractive and looks great on a counter 
best decemberween present ever i can t believe someone thinks these gorgeous glasses are ugly ! oh my god i opened these and i cried they are so beautiful each glass has its own little personality it s own pretty curve hold one of these and it practically talks to you they are so incredibly big and gorgeous ! even though they are primarily designed to present each type of wine at optimum bouquet flavor the size and shape of the glasses also displays the color very well too these are the crown jewels of my glassware collection i am incredibly happy with them 
love it been using this for years now the bonjour coffee press was mentioned in a magazine maybe esquire as a top pick and after a little more research we purchased an cup version we and our dinner guests loved it so much we decided to get the cup version heres why we like it the container looks really nice on the table we get lots of compliments on it we ve had it for over years now use it daily and haven t had a single problem i ve read about glass shattering or burning yourself w other models but we ve been fine we often put it in the top rack of our dishwasher on the normal dishwashing cycle too it s fairly easy to clean all the parts unscrew if you want to give it a thorough washing as with probably all french presses we feel like we get more flavor per scoop of coffee delicious coffee ! here are some tips we grind our coffee at the store on the french press setting so it s coarser we measure the coffee scoops but not really the water anymore since you get used to just looking at the color of the mixture or how far you normally fill it we use a wooden spoon wooden chopsticks and bbq skewers also work well to stir the grinds water mixture this helps prevent the glass from breaking if you accidentally hit the glass i d recommend getting this larger cup version as mentioned in the product description it comes out to mugs of coffee this is because the cups they refer to are really teacup sized this is true for all brands when they say cup not just bonjour the larger size gives you flexibility to make a little or a lot depending on your needs you can also use this for steeping tea handy with the loose leaf teas that aren t in bags since you can just press it down at the end 
great quality and value i bought the first set because they seemed well priced compared to the terrycloth style we usually use they are of high quality good color and do hold their shape i have to remember not to use a dryer sheet so they have increased absorbtion rate very pleased 
fabulous i really love this whole line i made cuban sandwiches with mine and was really pleased with how they turnes out i am also big on the aesthetic look of my cookware along with functionality and this line offers both aspects at an incredibly reasonable price 
good product good value this is a significant improvement over the model the model was not very well designed the first one we purchased broke within days because the blade came up and hit the plastic we returned this we got the to replace that the has been redesigned to avoid this problem for the same price as the the comes with one extra bowl juicer and egg whisk compared with others like the cuisinart and we determined that this was much better constructed 
excellent this kettle is really quiet compared to the last kettle i had which was a krups and sounded like a tractor for the first couple of weeks i found there was a plastic smell when the kettle boiled but it wears off after a while it looks great 
great machine i love that it has a mini bowl so much less storage also it runs so much more quiet than my old hamilton beach i am so impressed love kitchen aid anything 
a well made classy lamp this lamp went together with no problem the pieces fit tightly and the lamp stands perfectly upright it is more brownish than reddish but i believe that it can go with many colors especially pastels the design color and simplicity make this a very classy lamp the slate shade is gorgeous and much tougher than i thought this lamp as most lamps is not made for grabbing and moving too much put it where you want it and enjoy it s beauty ! buying this lamp is a win win situation 
ok so far have not had it for very long i have arthritis and it is easy for me to use 
this is excellent for cappuccino lover this is very easy to use and to clean and i love this cappuccino more than starbucks i also love this looks it is so cute 
solid good rugged design i have got to say i m pretty impressed with this bag i have a lodge camp oven and was worried about the legs punching holes but the bottom has padding in between the inner and outer layers so it s really not a problem i am not only able to put in my oven but also some of the objects that are necessary to go with it the handles are of tough webbing i m quite satisfied especially at the price 
yep it s that good preliminary review i just used the aeropress for the second time and am very happy with it i ve read the reviews here and at and as effusive as they were i had one over riding concern would the coffee be too bland and not strong enough with a slight bitter kick for my taste i like coffee black and strong always have and always will good espresso is heavenly therefore all the reviews about how smooth the aeropress coffee is made me wary i like a touch of bitterness and distrusted the c degree recommended water temperature anyways the espresso came out nice and thick very full bodied and rich there also was a very nice combination of enough acid with a heavy rich taste experience the complexity of some good beans came through and perhaps were even enhanced over my good french press i m delighted ill come back and expand when i ve used this a bit more but as for now i highly recommend the aeropress and can assure those who may have similar concern that a hand press won t deliver real espresso it does one more word there is real crema if one firmly pumps down an inch or two of air on top of the grounds the quality of the crema is just so so light with no distinction but it s there a professional espresso machine works at about psi bars atmospheres to get the crema everyone loves and that is one thing and as far as i can tell the only thing out of reach for the aeropress 
comfy neck pillow i overheard a flight attendant raving about the neckbones and also saw it reviewed highly in shape magazine i still have not tried it in the car or on a flight but am excited to it does feel comfortable though is bigger than expected so pay attention to the dimensions before you buy 
neat coffee maker overall i really like this coffee maker ! the stainless steel carafe is great ! i only wish that the heating plate remained on for minutes or so after brewing it turns off right after the brewing is done which is a bit annoying especially when i set the timer for morning brewing and i m running late plus the alarm timer is called delay or something like that why not just call it alarm or timer 
rooster pasta set i m very happy with this pasta set it exactly matches the dinnerware set and the quality is great the pasta bowl is huge ! i am considering a second set to complete place settings the second pasta bowl would make an excellent salad bowl 
happy so far we bought this heater almost a year ago to use in the home office area we have no heating system in that room and it gets pretty cold we keep honeywell running at f for approximately hours a day and it works fine and heats up the room efficiently yesterday we purchased the delonghi trnt to put in the baby s room to save some space we hope delonghi will do the job as good as honeywell 
sturdy and useful for bagel lovers perhaps i appreciate this invention because several years ago i had to go to the emergency room because i had cut myself while cutting a bagel it turns out that er viabagel is one of the more common occurrences the thing is sturdy and would easily work for a small bagel bakery stand kudos to its inventor s 
great desk heater i bought this heater for my desk to keep my hands warm i was really surprised at the amount of heat it produced it won t heat a room but it does a great job on a cubicle 
one of our best wedding gifts my husband and i received this as a wedding present i had never heard of this product but it is one of our favourite gifts i am not experienced with slow cookers but i understand one of the disadvantages of slow cookers is that you sometimes have to worry about your food scalding that is not a concern with the thermal cooker we typically use it for soups and chili you do have to actually cook it first the inner pot can go on the stove and bring it to a boil then just place the pot in the thermal cooker and leave it for hours without worry of burning it s hot good and clean up is easy we love it 
excellent we love this vaccum ! it works really well and shows all the disgusting icky dirt that was collected which sadly never seems to end ! if only it would keep the dirt from coming back ! ha ha 
i love this kettle when a cup of tea sounds wonderful you won t have to wait long for it water heats very quickly and with the automatic shut off you won t have to worry about it boiling dry the very thin base is also great it s almost invisible when the kettle is sitting on it and is not cumbersome i purchased the black one and it looks great in my kitchen and is easily wiped off with a damp cloth 
it s true i often heard about the benefits of using reidel crystal to enhance the flavor and bouquet of wine but never tried it until i bought this set and it is true i chose a nice bottle of petit syrah wine but it was even better than usual in the reidal stemware be prepared it is a really big piece of stemware 
chef s choice w diamond hone knife sharpener we have one of the knife sharpeners and wanted two of them for christmas presents but after finding them we decided they we too expensive till we looked on amazon we ordered two of them at a much lower price and the shipping was very quick 
excellent this product was in perfect safe packaging and was delivered promptly thank you ! jennife 
perfect helper amazing how many things you can do with this little thing bought a caramel apple and had initially forgotten about it but it makes the perfect cuts to regular and candied apples and a great many other things 
works pretty good i replaced my steel sharpener that came with my twin cuisine set with this one works great and looks good enough to leave on the counter 
shower filter that works i never knew the difference in water by location until i visited la after showering down there my skin became very dry i did some research and found that this product was at the top of the list when it came to shower filter experiences there are other ones out there but this one was well documented i ended up purchasing the unit to see if it would help a skin condition i haven t used the unit long enough to notice but i can say that there is a noticeable difference in the way my skin and hair feels my skin is more moist and softer to the touch than without the filter the steam that forms smells fresher and the shower head provides a nice stable stream overall a great product and i hope to report back with my long term results 
the best cat collar ever it s thin it s adjustable and it s great my cats love the collar ! it s thin and doesn t leave a matted ring around their necks and because of the thin design it s not obvious so the bling they wear on their collar takes center stage i have all the colors and look forward to more colors being available soon 
great for on the go i bought this a few months ago and have not stopped using it since i get up real early in the morning to go to work and i just put the coffee in the maker at night and turn it on in the morning as long as you follow the plastic indicators on the side so you won t overflow the mug it s great ! very easy to clean since it s plastic keeps the coffee pretty warm i don t drink scolding coffee and the mugs cool it off fast enough where i can start perking up a lot sooner the only complaint i have is the tops to the mugs they don t seem to want to stay on so you have to hold it on with your finger and your mouth so it doesn t overflow other than that it s great 
awesome how can you not love thread count i love the sheets and the price was too good not to pass up i highly recommend this product 
great kettle i really like this kettle it heats water very quickly and shuts itself off if the water is too low or is boiling the only thing i don t like is the silver matte finish when i ordered it i thought the top was a brushed metal and its not its plastic made to look like satin nickel finish but really doesn t in person the glass carafe does look great sitting on the counter and compliments my contemporary kitchen its also offered in the shiny finish which looks much better in person but is still only plastic 
great yet not sound free excellent although the plastic is not sound free while the child tosses and turns in bed 
a must have if you decorate cakes you need to have a cake stand i m not a professional but enjoy is as a hobby it s quite handy 
great product works as advertized heavy duty easy to clean kids use it almost every night to mix milkshakes they prefer it to our blender 
great looking product i was very pleased with both the design and construction of this product there are enough hooks for all of my pots and pans and the shelf above is holding all the lids it was easy to install the brackets are actually on center so i was able to use the studs not all products have this dimension i have purchased the bronze finish and it is a dark bronze i recomend it for those who need to get more room in their cabinets 
a high quality multi purpose pan this pan is a high quality convenient addition to my kitchen which is precisely why i bought it the interchangable bottoms are easy to use and easy to clean it s made of a strong durable substantial matierial not a flimsy easy todent piece ! as an apartment dweller with a small kitchen this pan is ideal it is easy to store and has multiple purposes however it has one small potential drawback when used as a bundt pan it s a little small your standard bundt cake recipe will slightly overfill the pan 
i m not gadget y but this is great i don t normally use alot of electronics in the kitchen hardly even a blender so this is a rarity for me but i love it i am a huge fan of roasted garlic but also live in florida where it s a bad idea to have your oven going during about half the year this machine roasted bulbs to creamy perfection with no scorching and the outside of the roaster was only a little warm to the touch and clean up was just a few seconds also i have the terracotta colored machine and it looks downright cute on the counter 
a gift of chicago cutlery i actually purchased the chicago cutlery set for my daughter who had a set of knives serrated edges that were never sharp and couldn t easily be sharpened i was given chicago cutlery and the wooden block with sharpener as a gift and have been using them and sharpening them successfully for years they still look as good as new also 
stylish and good price this one is very nice serve and store hold good cups ! really good for the price lesser than the outlet price ! good buying ! 
the best pot in the house i never though that i would pay for a pot but i m glad i spent the money on this one it arrived in perfect condition and was put to the test immediately there are no hot spots and the pot is fairly easy to clean all of the receipes that we ve tried have been marvelous the meats are so tender and juicy they melt in your mouth this dutch oven has taken on favorite status in our house highly recommended 
they do bend after a while i ve used these for months to protect tile countertops and they basically work except they start bending after a while on the edges and something light like an empty glass tends to fall over they are heavy duty and i put hot items on them with no problems 
nice it s great for the price so far so good heats water fast light weight 
be careful i love the bodum french press for making tasty coffee this is the third beaker i ve had to buy though they break so easily ! be especially careful washing this item in the sink it will crack at the slightest impact 
a lot of beautifull collors i just love the design and i supose that everybody must find one collor they like its a lot of them 
great for wool rugs upholstery this is the tool for those surfaces that seem to suck in pet hair and refuse to let it go it s not a quick removal tool think more along the lines of scrubbing a floor than vacuuming but for things like wool dhurrie rugs it saves the expense of frequent professional cleanings or and is quicker than trying to pull the hair up with those sticky tape fur removal things it really does pull up tons of fur even from deep in a rug 
power ! and decent on the allergies this corded little vac is your answer if you re sick of cordless vacs that don t hold their power like i was i love it for the car and stairs and corners and family room carpet be prepared to buy a lot of filters the power in this thing does fill the filter quickly but i appreciate them because they help keep my allergies away when the filter is clean it is also a little bit loud but the noise means you re being productive apparently the industry isn t using space age insulation and noise reduction just yet i own two of these and am thinking of buying a third 
great for the home professional like sharpening in the home at a good price i love this sharpener and trust it s performance on good knives the magnetic guides make sure you sharpen the knife correctly so go ahead run your expensive knives through it it does a great job 
saved many a bottle of red after trying vacuum pump seals i found this to clearly beat them generally keeps our reds for a week when otherwise i would taste a vinegar taste after a day in reading some of the other reviewes i can t specifically recall whether it lasts for uses but with my wife and i drinking bottles a week it lasts for months well worth the money in my opinion 
makes ironing a breeze i just got this iron yesterday at linens things using their standard coupon you find all the time in the newspaper i tried it out on a cotton shirt and got the job down about five times faster than usual less work and no wrinkles the shirt looked like i got it back from the cleaners i also have an elna ironpress which also saves time but i think i will prefer using the rowenta steam iron since it steams the material while you iron it and it can get into more nooks and crannies note to rowenta engineers it would be nice if the water tank had a level indicator to let you know how much water is in it this would help when you fill it so as to prevent overfilling another option would be a removable water tank you could take over to the sink to fill also if this is a typical high quality rowenta product why only a one year warranty why not five or ten years 
great pizza completely pleased the pan and his recipe marios that is was perfect ps i am way over the age of 
great slicer i think this is a great slicer for the price i am a cook by occupation and i bought one of these for my small restaurant i liked it so much i also bought one for home use i have sliced everything from a lb roast beef to bread i love it 
works pretty well except i have three cats and bought this to keep one of them away from my door it works very well on two of them but the one i wanted to deter is a siamese if you read the fine print it does state it might not work on some exotics it also won t work if your cat has hearing problems for all others it is great 
perfect for a short trip i purchased this in advance of a quick three day trip we live in the middle of nowhere and i cannot expect someone to come over and feed our cat twice a day sasha is a little piggy and we cannot leave food in any quantity or she will eat until she vomits started using it at last nights dinner hour and she was not afraid of it at all ate like her normal gulp it down in a minute it opened this morning just fine at one point today i found her sleeping next to it the only draw back is the timer you need to set it so it does its thing at the correct interval from the time you set it and that the first feeding is right there cannot have it all at that price a good item at a reasonable price 
victory i turned the device onto human sound because on sub sonic i didn t get the satisfaction of hearing it trigger when the neighbor s two daschund dogs barked early in the morning the device itself on human sound was triggered by many things air condtioner mower air plane thunder etc which was not good in that i doubt it would serve as an effective training device the dogs seemed to trigger it at random times we have large lots here in this area of nj and i placed the device on the property border and that may have been the problem however my neighbor became so annoyed by the constant cycling on and off of the very invasive long distance tweeting noise that she begged for me to remove the device from the pole i placed on the border of my property and agreed to a more reasonable regime for dogs outside times she advised me that her book clubs inside and pool parties were interrupted and disturbed constantly the capitulation occurred about two weeks after installation i would say that this device is well worth the cost for that reason alone 
it s bigger than you think it s well made sturdy good looking pet crate i bought the small first for my pound cat and it was much too large so i exchanged it for the extra small and it is just right remember that it s a crate so don t look for the handle 
best washer i used ! compact quiet clean i have been using this haier for hlpe weeks i live in an apartment and there is not enough room there this machine is great ! it takes so little room i just put it in the bathroom it is so convenient before i am cooking a meal i throw or clothes into it and after i finish my lunch the clothes ready the spin is so good that the clothes are almost dry for some clothes like t shirts you don t even need a dryer we have public laundry using coins but i think this haier small washer washes much cleaner than that and what s more important you don t have to drive far out to the laundry it is very quiet at least much much more quiet than the public laundry you can do other things like listening to music in your bedroom and the washer works in your bathroom it doesn t interfere and i move sometimes so it s much better you have a smaller washer than a huge one i just cant love this small machine more 
better than anticipated i thought towels for bucks how nice could they be well surprisingly enough quite nice they are high quality and oversized unlike many kitchen towels that shrink down to the size of a postage stamp once washed these did not shrink much be sure to take them out of the dryer immediately to avoid excessive wrinkling but that would be true of any linen i have been using them about months now and the colors are holding up well and i find myself reaching for them first before my other towels so i m going to buy another set now 
don t buy this poster if you want to sleep at night o k buy this poster if you like spooky things but don t say you were not warned you are in luck this is a two sided poster so you can always turn it around this is a good poster for both movie poster collectors and those familiar with the books the movie encompasses several of the first books of the series and the poster is indicative of both you will need room to display this x poster i suggest getting a side panel from a refrigerator delivery box placing it in a poster frame will prevent it from getting any bite marks 
great knife holder great knife holder at a reasonable price exactly what i was looking for 
buying towels online this is the second or third time i have purchased linens on line from amazon when i receive the merchandise it is always as expected although i have to pay shipping for me it is a convenience expense i live an hour away from a shopping center have an intense work schedule allowing little time for shopping in a conventional way this is a terrific way for me to buy what i want get the quality i expect and make the best use of my time 
sheet review i bought this as a gift i was told that the count label was applied on the package over a count label the sheets feel like a higher grade than but it makes one wonder we also recieved king size rather than queen we may have considered exchanging them but the recipient is out of country 
excellent knife for home cooks with small medium hands i received this knife recently as a wedding gift and i have been very pleased with its performance note however that while the edge as shipped is sharp enough to slice through onions and scallions completely it isn t sharp enough to slice through office paper dropped from mid airthe kind of edge that many knife enthusiasts look for so sharpening is recommended the gourmet line is the lowest end of the wusthof line that is manufactured in germany the silverpoint line is made elsewhere while wusthof literature says that this knife is made from the same steel as their higher end knives the gourmet line is made from stamped steel as opposed to forged steel as for the knife itself the blade tapers from the handle to the tip the knife has good heft and its rivets are flush against the handle there is no bolster or finger guard a plus factor in my opinion because it makes proper sharpening of the edge easier it also allows me to use the entire edge when i am slicing larger pieces of meat on the other hand i docked a star because the tang the part of the blade that goes through the handle does not go all the way it is only a tang top and half of the rear of the handle only i do not think that this factor affects the performance of the knife very significantly but one gets a full tang from the comparable knife in the gourmet line of henckels for a slightly lower price nevertheless it is a great value for a higher end knife i highly recommend it 
yummy homemade yogurt i ve had my yogurt maker for about months now and still love it ! i once had a salton back in the s but i can attest to this being much better every batch i ve made has been great even with occasional differences i enjoy eating my yogurt plain but i also love topping it with fresh fruit nuts and maybe a touch of granola sooo good i prefer the boil method of preparation but there is a non boil method as well try them both and see which you prefer i highly recommend buying a box of spare jars too it adds to the cost but this will allow you to start a new batch without having to wait to use and clean up the jars from the previous batch it will also provide you with spare parts which i discovered the hard way i somehow lost a lid from the original set about two months after i got the yogurt maker if i hadn t had the extra jars i would now have a yogurt maker that makes six jars of yummy yogurt rather than seven speaking of yogurt i think i ll go get some now ! yum 
reasonable this product does a good job of removing chlorine from shower water at a reasonable price 
very good product i gave these as a gift to my mother for christmas she could not have thanked me enough a very good product for the price 
item does work however with patience the apple slicer blade works nicely the large cut french fry slicer works but the secret is to place the large end of the potato under the blade first remember these are manual type cutters that do require patience and safety issues i have used my cutters many times and they have not broken i am a small frame person with not much strength do not try to slam the blade through the item all at one time potatoes are more dense than an apple you have to master the use of these blades and they do work 
highest quality our original micro go round finally gave up the ghost after twenty years of use we were happy to find the product still available for purchase and there have been significant improvements in design and functionality we have no reason at this point to think that we won t have the new and improved model for another couple of decades 
great for the price the only thing about this is it s a bit smaller than what i expected it doesn t quite cover our ugly floral couch but you get what you pay for good for the price 
polycarbonate is the way to go these polycarbonate glasses are terrific ! what the manufacturer says is true they really don t break and they don t show wear from the dishwasher i suppose if you tried jumping up and down on one or ran over it with a steam roller it make break but these glasses have survived my three kids and that s a pretty big feat and they look great just like glass you might think it s made of glass until you pick it up a great product for people with kids or for use in your rv on your boat out on the patio by the pool etc 
simply the best i have used this taylor thermometer for years and it is reliable accurate and easy to use you can use it in the oven while the meat casserole etc is baking other thermometers have a glass insertion rod and can break the stainless steel taylor goes in without having to make a hole first with another utensil for christmas i gave these thermometers to all my children and my parents who could not find them my husband cannot grill without this thermometer 
works but does it affect the taste as a vintner we remove the co from the wine as part of our process this device uses co to pop the cork very clever however this minor introduction of co is insignificant and will vent quickly at times there is an off taste like a lubricant or something which affects the initial taste of the wine let it breath for a while minutes or so and it seems ok this device works well on corks but is a hit and miss on composites and plastics do not use it on partially filled bottles as it takes to much gas from the small cylinder to be effective rew 
coffee maker bunn makes excellent products and having fresh brewed coffee in three minutes is the cat s meow 
great for quoton the go quot i just received my zojirushi duel coffeemaker and it lives up to my expectation it distributes coffee evenly into both cups and the cups are great for home or travel i was very surprised at the great cup of coffee this machine makes i would purchase again great little coffee maker ! 
i love this grill i wanted to replace my george foreman grill and happened upon the hamilton beach indoor grill at this site after reading the ratings from other consumers which i think is a fantastic idea for target com i was ecstatic ! all of the things i disliked about the gf grills were mentioned by others especially the task of cleaning them cleaning my hb grill is far less difficult because everything except the electric probe is immersible i was a bit concerned about grease splattering because the hb grill isn t covered but that turned out to be a non issue not to mention it costs less than the price of the comparable gf grill ! thank you hamilton beach for making such an outstanding product and thank you target com 
another wish list item found and received i have wanted one of these for years i put off because i didn t want to put it together im a year old alone i kept looking for one locally guess what it s already assembled comes as you see it thanks so much

recipe card dividers just as i expected hard to find even in stationary or kitchen product stores delivered quickly with no complications 
wow my samoyed loves this toy and so far hasn t managed to trash it yay ! it s sturdy and very chewable 
swing away wall can opener it s the best i ordered two to replace the two that had worn out but only after years of faithful service one for my home and one for our summer hideaway this made me think what a great practical gift this would make included with it some canned goods for the newly weds they d thank me some day 
good overall unit good things dry and wet pick uplightbad things does not have a charging station average suctio 
could be better i had a pampered chef sprayer that i loved but it got clogged and stopped working after or years i should have tried harder to find a pampered chef rep to buy another one the pampered chef one works better than this one however this is not a horrible product one drawback compared to the pampered chef one is that you can t see through this one to see how high the oil level is you want to fill it just a bit higher than halfway and when it is less than full you need to fill it back up or it won t work as well this unit is even more finicky than the pampered chef one about the level it almost won t spray if the level is too low but since you can t see through it even holding it up to the light you have to look down in and estimate how high it is the reflective coating inside makes it very hard to see how high it really is you don t want to fill it all the way up either then you need to pump it more than the pampered chef one needed to be pumped this one sprays a very fine spray finer than the pampered chef one and it sprays quite nicely if you have the correct level of oil in there i think i know why my old one got clogged so i m trying something new each time i m done before i put it away i twist the screw on cap around the nozzle and release the pressure i think if you leave it pressured up all the time like i did with my old one it damages the nozzle over time but time will tell if i m right another tip don t fill it with anything but olive oil other oils evaporate and leave a sticky greasy feeling on the outside of the sprayer you know what i mean if you use vegetable oil for stovetop cooking a lot you get that greasy feeling on things that you leave near the stove or that hang over it olive oil doesn t do that that s why i now don t use anything else on my stovetop except sometimes peanut oil for stir frying this type of sprayer will work much better if you just use olive oil in it trust me but if you have a choice go find a pampered chef rep and by their sprayer it s cheaper and better quality 
microsuede duvet set great duvet and pillow shams for the price soft and comfortable a great buy 
very pleased with sugar please it took a little getting use to but once i realized that a teaspoon took three presses instead of two i was very satisfied with this little gadget i had purchased two one for sugar and one for splenda it would be nice if they could make these in different colors 
cuts bagels like butter i first saw this being used in a hotel breakfast establishment in sedona az the server gave me the name of the product and i ordered it from amazon this cuts bagels right from the refrigerator also with ease you can even cut one using only one hand it is totally safe because the blade is encased in hardened plastic i just love it use it all the time i highly recommend it 
worth the price this is the coolest thing i ve ever bought for under you have to be sure it s sitting on a flat surface or the chocolate won t flow evenly the motor made a sad little sound when we first started it up so i can t give it stars but i know i read in other reviews somewhere that you have to run a bit of vegetable oil in it first before you pour the chocolate in regardless the sound goes away after the chocolate s been flowing for awhile the clean up was extra sweet and messy i didn t mind it also i did have to get back online and read some other reviews to find out how other people remedied the oil in the chocolate another reason why it didn t get stars the recipe in the manual made our chocolate too smooth when you dipped a strawberry in it it didn t harden fast enough thank goodness they sent a off coupon on quality chocolate the other remedy may be less oil in the chocolate other reviewers said it was gross but it tasted just fine to us come on it s chocolate it s already bad for you still this is a big hit and totally worth the money i will be looking into better chocolate not a better fountain this one is great 
great cooker must have for life i live very close to my office and cook every day this guy helps me to quickly finish tough work with delicious taste before i have it i had a really bad experience once when i forgot to reduce the scale of my electric stove for beef and it dried and smelled a lot with this pressure cooker every thing is simple and quick i don t need to wait for several hours or left it without attention i like it ! and recommend to all my friends 
nice pan i thought this was a nice pan but i don t think it was quite worth the plus shipping i thought it would be heavier for that price its still a good pan and i found plenty of recipes online for baked donuts they usually call for them being piped onto a cookie sheet but i just used the pan instead with fine results i do agree the donuts are a little heavier than normal store bought cake donuts but still they are good just don t over fill the shapes and your donuts come out fine looking nothing stuck not even to the center flutes i will definitely use it again and try many different recipes the donuts are not too big or too small fill in the forms with a pastry bag or plastic bag with a corner cut out it makes it much easier to fill and the final product looks so much better 
high quality and user friendly the henckels star knives are wonderful i am able to get such a good grip on these very happy with the set the only difference between this star set and the star set is the handles i personally liked how my hand contoured to these handles previously owned the famous and expensive cutco knives these are just as well balanced highly recommend 
great hand held sharpner for a relatively inexpensive sharpner this does a super job and the scissor sharpner is a welcome extra 
excellent transaction fastest shipping ever ! thank you so much we will buy from you again 
t fal is wonderful i have a set of t fal pans which are years old this new pan is even better and you can t beat the prices for t fal and the quality i have always washed my pans by hand and the t fal pans are a sinch to wash by hand it keeps them in great condition and years later still non stick 
great excellent pedometer for the money worthwhile investment i only had to play around with the step measurement sensitivity and now it works great radio works great also definately reccommend 
good value i purchased the i roast after having decent luck with i roast hearthware seems to have corrected some of the very minor flaws with version and i am extremely happy with it the major thing that has been corrected is the tendency of the sealed top to unseal itself which was a mess i have not had this happen with version with some green beans you have to roast smaller batches ethopian comes to mind or it will overheat and shut down however it will do almost any controlled roast you could ever want version seems much improved in roasting the entire batch more evenly something that was not necessarily the case with version version also seems to take more slough out of the roasting chamber do be forewarned that this unit is very noisy as most home roasters are with the exception of the freshroast so your neighbors may hate you if you live in an apartment this is a great unit for the home roaster 
durable product so far i have only had this for a month but so far its holding up to my endless loads of laundry 
henckels knife block i saw the same product at a leading retail store for a much higher price i m very happy with the knife block and with the price my old knife block looked grungy and didn t hold as many knives 
easy to use i really like these wipes for all of my stainless steel appliances they clean and shine everything really well i just use a soft cloth to dry the appliances after wiping them down i also use the spray made by the same company along with the wipe i have several appliances and wipe dries out before i am finished no streaks doing it this way 
pinzon sauce pan i love this sauce pan it almost compelets the set that i want to buy thank yo 
great rice cooker i had used a panasonic rice cooker that is similar to this one it worked great for nearly years and finally the non sticky layer was worn out so i bought this sr gfg cup rice cooker steamer it works great so far just as i d expect i would definitely recommend this one to others 
perfect i love these for leftovers as the re heating process is simple just pop open the top and microwave i have no trouble getting them on and off and have had hand surgeries 
the right tool for the job i m at a point in my life where i am developing a taste for quality and can finally afford the kind of quality i desire i like to dabble in the kitchen so i ve been building my arsenal of kitchenware recently i ve invested in some high quality cookware and utensils and started working on some appliances i ve got an cup cuisinart food processor but that tends to be overkill for a lot of smaller jobs i hate all the cleanup involved with making a cup of guacamole dip for instance i like to use peeled whole tomatoes to make tomato sauce for pasta dishes but my wife doesn t care for chunks of tomato in the finished sauce no problem i just dunk the stick blender right into the can of tomatoes and out comes a nice thick puree with all the rich flavor that pre made sauces seem to lack this stick blender came highly recommended by an acquaintance and it doesn t disappoint with its high power motor variable speed settings and versatile accessories this is a compact and high impact kitchen tool easy to clean too i would urge caution if you ve never used one of these before especially when working with very watery liquids as they can end up getting blown right out of your container if you re not careful 
compare this to mario s i ve had mine for about years it stays in my oven i agree with the one reviewer about packing since the first one i received had one of the handles broken off seriously i paid about for this from amazon and with ordering another item i got free shipping buy this if you want the best pizza stone on the market mario s is the same piece with an enamel coating no effect on cooking for lodge is always the way to go in cast iron 
performs exactly as described this item performs exactly as was described in any of the marketing information i read that in and of itself is something to be happy about keeps coffee hot up to hours is easy to disassemble and clean and the stainless steel is well worth the extra the last one i had was aluminum and it became dulled and dirty looking over time this one looks new all the time 
wonderful little dish with a million uses i bought this to use for brown bagging but have used it for so much more this little dish is great for storing leftovers or taking small portions to potlucks all without having to change the contents to a dressier dish french white is attractive enough to go with your best china and a much better value for the money 
knife sharpening is not a dull subject after my wife complained that our kitchen knives were getting too dull to use i set out to find a good knife sharpener for household use i researched a bit and found several options both manual and electric one name that kept popping up was chefs choice and i noticed very few negative comments on their models having both a discount coupon and gift certificate from bed bath beyond i decide to make my decision there unfortunately there wasn t any sales staff knowledgeable about knife sharpeners and i had to go it alone it was there that i first noticed the waring ks professional sharpener with it s black and stainless finish it was definitely more attractive than the plain white chef s choice but it was somewhat more expensive retailing at i settled for the chef s choice took it home and was promptly disappointed on the expensive chef s knife i first tried it on it left a decidedly sharp but ragged edge on the blade it looked as though i had tried to sharpen the knife on the sidewalk ! i didn t dare try sharpening any other knives and risk leaving such an ugly edge on them bed bath beyond gladly made an exchange for the waring and i was much more pleased with it s final results a sharp blade with a more visually pleasing edge it even cleaned up the rough edge left by the chef s choice the only disadvantage i have found is that with most knives the inch or so of blade nearest the handle cannot be sharpened since the hilt of the knife keeps it from being placed into the sharpener s slots this however is not a major drawback since this area of the blade is not frequently encountered in most uses the chef s choice will cover the entire blade length but with a very rough finish i recommend the waring over the chef s choice without reservation but the waring is probably a bit too expensive for an appliance that will likely see only a very few uses a year 
premium toast tried other toasters in months uneven toasting broken knobs you name it this little gem is great at making even toast and also a fine bagel only takes a few days to get aquainted with the settings it also looks great and doesn t eat half the counter very pleased 
say cheese this is a great product especially for starting a dinner party or a cheese amp wine gathering the recessed well has plenty of room for crackers or fruit amp the slicer slices cheese smoothly amp efficiently plus when the evening is over you only have to wash one item 
tickled pink i am thrilled with this product i make alot of homemade fries and this is now one of the best kitchen helpers i have yes you have to use smaller potatos but it is sure making my life easier i now have fries ready to drop into the deep fat fryer in th the time it used to take cutting them by hand 
works as described this little unit works well i had a cat accident in a very cramped area in my basement that ended up causing a very nasty smell in our basement and part of our house upstairs we put it near the location of the accident and ran it on the quick clean mode for a few hours and then in standard mode the rest of that day and the following day the smell diminished substantially over that time operates fairly quietly only complaint is cost of filter refills are they really worth bucks 
smaller bites but works great see the photos ive uploaded this is not bad it created batches of smaller like kind of pancake the lodge brand created a bigger shell like shape this one just has its twingi dont like to go on and describe my first time experience today see and believe ive uploaded the pics here and in flickr id buy this if you re under budget and you want to create cute like pancake it doesnt create those fuffy shell like but its worth it i love to cook so im happy to have this in my collection not preseasoned so what i did my oil spray on it 
great knife i purchased this for my wife a hundred bucks for a knife insane ! until you use it i think this is worth the money my wife says is the best thing since sliced bread and you can slice bread with it seriously great knife it will last a long time don t keep buy cheapo knives year after year just get one of these very sharp edge nice weight and comfortable 
good i wish they were a little bigger but i like that they are stackable and come with the organizer it was worth the money 
beautiful i ve had this set for years and love it if you see water stains it s your dishwasher not the set try some vinegar in your rinse cycle and you may see a difference and rust no way somethings up as mine are just as beautiful now than when i first bought it 
home made latte s this product is really amazing ! whips up the milk in seconds for great latte s home i would recommend this product with my eyes closed regards 
pretty good for the price i m pretty happy with this product though i ve only had it for weeks so i cannot comment on the longevity it was the lowest priced rug to rug pad i found there is some very small movement on my high traffic rugs but it is very small just enough to let some of the pad peek out there was no bunching at all the regular traffic rugs haven t moved a bit 
a great product the fry pan is easy to use and clean the skillet part is easy to remove when heated and also stores well in the provided tray holder we use it every day what a wonderful machine 
wonderful set i love it you wont find corelle sets easily in stores but amazon is selling almost all varieties of sets at reasonable price i bought mixing bowls and the piece set along with this piece set its wonderful even for gift i loved my set very much 
no problems to report ok cmon now it s a whisk and works well i own many oxo products and am pleased with almost all their products they all perform their function well and with style and they are also very comfortable to use thanks to the famous oxo nonslip rubber handle seems very sturdily made and have had absolutley no problems i would hihgly reccommend 
very pleased with purchase mikasa s dishes blend well with my paltzgraf gazebo collection extending my adventure in white dishes into the second years of our marriage these are great for blending with other tableware and lend themselves to formal or casual dinners we ve used them in the warming oven and microwave kids love the size of the bowls for cereal and icecream but we ve had to school them on portion size in oz bowls i ordered three sets and had to ask amazon to send another to replace dishes broken in transit each of the three sets had broken dinner or salad plates we were able to replace all with the fourth shipment the exchange was very easy 
momster it really cools the wine fast and looks nice great gift to take to a dinner party not good for keeping things cold for long hours so drink fast 
the best grinder for the best grind we have had one of these grinders for over years it was always the best and easiest to use simple to change grind size easy to fill and the side turn gives excellent leverage when grinding we broke the top and kept it in place with duct tape not real pretty we were so happy to find the same grinder and now have two 
the main selling point is inaccurate misleading i am a huge tea drinker and as you know there are two key temperatures in the tea world less than boiling f and boiling as far as i know there are only two readily available variable temperature electric kettles on the market the t fal vitesse and one from adagio teas i chose the former and have been using it for about months i assumed that since water can t get hotter than f the highest most right setting would correspond to that so the middle had to be roughly i ve brewed dozens of cups of tea some for guests some very expensive with this assumption today i brought in a thermometer and found the following low fmedium fhigh fthis is outrageous ! why make a product that is not truly variable or accurate and sell it as such 
quality knife set i ordered from amazon the kitchenaid kaprn cook s series piece cutlery set with traditional natural block red handles which is exactly the same as this set but cheaper the picture for the other set is wrong though because it shows polished handle ends for the steak knives but the handles are red plastic only and the handle ends for the other pieces are actually brushed steel and not polished as shown in the picture in essence the knife set that is pictured here is the knife set that you will also get if you purchase the other kitchenaid knife set that i ve mentioned above as far as the knives themselves the weight is perfect for chopping and the blades are nice and sharp the funky red color looks cute in my kitchen too the only negative is they re not dishwasher safe but luckily they do clean easily by hand even though amazon is having a hard time correctly picturing the kitchenaid knife sets i m very satisfied with the set that i received and thrilled to finally have a knife set to be proud of 
can t get enough of this toy ! our dogs prey drive goes wild when they see these balls come out we have to monitor the use though they each have to have their own ball and we have to take them away from the dogs before they collapse they go really go crazy for them and would play soccer for hours until they drop the only down side is that our dogs can dig their teeth into the plastic around where the small opening is on one end this creates gashes which we need to keep scraped down after play otherwise the dogs mouths cheeks and lips become very sore and cut up as they roll the balls around the yard keep in mind we have very strong dogs with high prey drive when they have the gashes made they can carry the ball around ours carry them proudly around the yard as if it is a trophy ! if the balls were made of some sort of really hard rubber like a black type kong or something it would be better but then they would weigh too much for the money you just can t beat this toy 
great shakers what a nice addition to your table ! they re quite pretty and very easy to grab especially for those with arthritis and for toddlers without them spilling all over the place they look really retro and can start quite a conversation at the table i ve found them to be just fine size wise but you do have to refill them quite often great product though goes from the table to the dishwasher top rack without problems

this is it my mother had one of these saucepans and used it daily as far back as i can remember for everything from boiling potatoes to making gravy when she passed away i took it and use it all the time it came witha double boiler insert which also got and gets frequest use particularly for melting chocolate my pan has to be at least years old the handle is still tight and the cover still seals it s as good as they day mom bought it half a century or more ago what more could you ask 
the best dvd tower for quite a while i had been looking for a certain type of dvd rack towerthen one day in target i was looking at the mission collection and saw the box no display it is exactly what i had been looking for slapped on the two foot ends and done ! perfect fit for dvds fit across and if you have a lot of the cheapy dvd cases like the ones new line cinema puts out you can fit more i don t have the hassle like some wire racks where you can only fit one dvd per slot i have many oversized ones the hardwood is great too just a few felt pads on the backs to not scratch the wall if you can wait for them to go on sale every now and then it is worth it i am almost ready to buy a third one soon 
great little food processor my husband got me this mini prep processor for christmas and i love it it is great for making fine cracker crumbs and stuff for breading it is quick and easy to clean up and best of all it isn t bulky or too heavy it is great for everyday use and saves me a lot of time 
perfectly fits the books atmosphere for those of you unfamiliar with the a series of unfortunate events books they detail the absurdly tragic lives of the fictional baudelaire orphans and their struggles to overcome adversity after adversity after adversity ad infinitum hovering in the background of their tragedies and occasional brief glimpses of happiness is their distant cousin the scheming greedy conniving ruthless cousin the count given the concept of the story this poster fits perfectly with the orphans standing together but otherwise alone in the middle with the shadow of the count casting gloom upon them it is a perfect fit as is the casting of jim carrey as the count 
excellent the chairs are great they came in sooner than expected and were reasonable and constructed well 
wonderful thing i recently got diagnosed with allergy to dust we got this gadget for the bedroom we try to keep the door closed and run it on low med all the time we can t hear it but the results are great i feel much better 
this is the best deal love it love it we have researched and researched and finally took the plunge on this cup neuro fuzzy cooker and we absolutley love it we eat rice at least twice a week and it is soooo easy to use and clean it is easy to cook cup of rice on this even though we bought the larger model for when we entertain my hubbie loves it and he used to be the minute rice man and now loves the taste of the jasmine rice cooked proper he is a convert as he was harder to convince than me i guarantee that if you love to cook rice and have hated the experiences of cleaning and under over cooked rice you will not regret buying this appliance the rice comes out perfectly everytime from jasmine basmati and brown rice this is the best out there though dont go for the cheaper alternatives you get what you pay for that is what my dad taught me and he has never been wrong 
great kitchen knife this was the first global knife i owned and it is the most used in my collection i find it has great balance an excellently sharpened blade and a nice shape for dicing one of the things that i was originally apprehensive about when i bought this knife was amazon s description of this being for small handed individuals as i am six foot and of average build i have no problems handling this knife its a little more slippery than say the chicago cutlery knives i have with wooden handles but the trade off is that it s easier to clean dont put it in the dishwasher and looks a lot cooler if you re serious about cooking and have the coin to upgrade i would go with global s heavier line these knives are a little more difficult to sharpen than most knives i ve had especially this one with its curved blade the manufacturer says to use a waterstone which i have but i tend to use my electric sharpener which does the job nicely since i ve bought this knife i ve acquired the chef s knife vegetable knife and the paring knife from this collection and i am happy with all of them 
delightful this beautiful suger bowl looks lovely when setting out your tea or coffee you can use it for sugar or for lemon wedges if you take your tea with lemon 
great deal i love this duvet i knew ahead of time that the back side is regular cotton but that didnt dissuade me it is very soft and plush and beautiful for dollars you cant beat it 
great knives but watch out lefties i agree with all of the accolades given to this paring knife by other reviewers it s razor sharp and a work of art however it is designed for a right handed person which shouldn t be surprising given that it s designed and made in japan as you may have guessed i m left handed most people don t realize how many products are designed for righties and the challenges this presents for lefties the asymmetry on this isn t so severe that i won t be able to use it largely because it is so small the d shape described in the product info isn t quite accurate there is a ridge running down the right side of the handle designed to fit in the crease of your hand that ridge hits the middle of my thumb when i hold the knife in my left hand this knife is great but i won t be able to get a larger version unless they do away with the dshaped pakkawood handle comfortable offset steel bolster or make a left handed version 
rowenta steamer this machine is amazing i ve been wanting a professional grade steamer for a very long time it is simple to assemble and use i had to wait for it for a couple of months but it was worth it 
i love this machine i have had a blast with this machine since it came out of the box ! it is remarkably easy to use and the results have been wonderful 
tough little booger i put this clock on my wedding registry cause i liked the look of it and it seemed sturdy and boy is it ! my husband and i are stationed in spain and over here the kitchen walls are solid tile from floor to ceiling i wanted this clock in my kitchen so i baught some sticky hooks to hang it with thinking that two should hold it well twice youd think i d have learned the first time it fell off the wall bounced off the counter after first completely shattering a dish wow and to the floor sliding accross the kitchen i was surprise to see it was not only still working but had just a minor scratch on the metal ! this is a tough little booger and i would definitely buy another one plus the warranty is very good and i finally got it mounted firmly to my kitchen wall yea 
good product speedy delivery and good product i like that the bar slides out to better fit any size sink 
sturdy and hassle free this is an excellent egg slicer the metal is sharp and eggs are sliced cleanly all the way through it s easy to clean and quite sturdy other egg slicers i ve used don t seem as solidly built i recommend this one 
where have these been all my life these hercules hooks are absolutely incredible i wish i had them before my husband put many many holes in our walls with anchors and screws if i want to relocate anything he tries to patch up the hole but it always shows these hooks make only a pin sized hole ! i hung a shelf unit in my bathroom and put books on it it is still there incredible product and well worth the price

dking i love this blanket it is just long enough and soooo soft i love it we have had a cold winter and it has came in handy buy it 
absolutely the best simply put an awesome churn for home made ice cream i have an old hand crank that i had always used to make the best ice cream but it was a lot of work churning fast at the beginning and then slowing down as the cream transformed with this churn the motor is variable in its speed and churns at an excellent fast speed to begin then as the cream solidifies and freezes the motor changes pitch and slows down to give you a wonderfully whipped and smooth cream i even made ice cream using just whole milk and peppermint sticks and it still turned out great highly recommended and much better than any other electric churn you can buy i ve had two other electric churns neither of them could hold a candle to the white mountain 
coffee in a fun cup what people don t think about is how hot chocolate works just as well as coffee in a coffee mug i m not a coffee drinker but if this mug brings you great coffee joy you should also pour hot chocolate in it i have to take a point off because after you pour coffee in this mug enough times a permanent smell is left there which means using this cup for anything other than coffee or hot chocolate is gross especially water who wants to take a sip of water only to smell coffee every time you put the mug to your face not me not that the smell of coffee is horrible or anything it smells good and i can t imagine not smelling it every morning when other people in my home are making some a great mug you should buy 
lots of room this product has lots of room for our cd s dvd s it also looks nice the shipping was fast i originally thought it could use more shelves after contacting the manufacturer they were prompt in sending me more shelves what service ! i do see some irony in the fact that the cabinet is so well made comes with a lock but the back is made of cardboard that is easily coming off because of the usage go figure ! otherwise a good product serves it s purpose well 
excellent fan we purchased this fan during the heat wave this past summer and it was a great buy not only was it priced well but it has been an excellent fan for our small home expecially during the warm nights we love the fact that it has an automatic shut off feature and also an exhaust for when you need to reverse the air flow this fan helped to cut our air conditioning bills significantly and even our friend asked me to orderd her one too 
midgy stays home midgy stays home with this wirless system it works for us but if you are having problems rtfd i understandwhy some people get frustrated with the system dog proof your life make things easier for yourself i came home last night and my lab pit was on my pourch and never left her area down fall to this system it isn t battery backed up i can work with that ! 
great machine great price i read mixed reviews on the xp on the web with some folks tagging it as unreliable or noisy or in several cases doa i decided to take a chance because my past experience with a krups espresso machine was excellent ive had the xp for over a month now and it has performed flawlessly since day one the coffee is terrific the frothing attachment works well i removed the attachment from my last machine and used the metal wand only and it works beautifully with my favorite brand of ground coffee far better than my old machine i would have given the xp five stars except for the wait between pushing a button and achieving results for instance if you brew your espresso and press the steam button you have to wait some time before the machine is ready to roll i suspect this is no different than what might be expected from any machine in this class but it is irritating in the wee hours when i am impatiently awaiting my first jolt of the day so far the xp is a great machine and i am a satisfied customer 
great quality great size my wife and i have long been fans of fiestaware and we have been using many of their pieces for years somehow it wasn t until about years ago that we discovered this size at the lunch plate is perfect for many occasions especially lunch ! smilethe quality of these plates is very good and this size is very uselul for some reason these are seldom seen as part of a standard set we use ours all the time highly recommended ! 
wonderful wine glasses i highly recommend the spiegelau authentis line for value and beauty these glasses truly do enhance the experience of the wine and are priced so that you can enjoy them every day while a delicate and beautiful showcase for wine they are also sturdy enough to stand up to being used and washed on a regular basis if you are looking to amp up you wine drinking experience give these a try 
happy so far we ve used this at the grill with steaks in the oven with a turkey breast and on the stovetop to make candy it s worked perfectly every time so far i like that you can stick it to the outside of the oven and it beeps when the correct temp has been reached a very useful kitchen gadget to have on hand 
excellent pillow for people with neck or shoulder pain we bought this pillow for our daughter who was experiencing neck and shoulder pain in the mornings after just a day or two of using this pillow the pain and shoulder strain were greatly reduced after a few weeks the pain is gone these microbead pillows are great for people who need neck support while they sleep i highly recommend them if you have this problem 
happy with purchase received ontime and in like new condition works well and we like it alot 
great rack great coat rack for the price it s very original in design and accents my home it s been very durable all thru last winter and now for another one to come 
perhaps the best decision i have made i researched and researched semi automatic and automatic machines until i was so thoroughly confused that i had no idea which way to go alicia at whole latte love steered me towards the s after answering many of my questions and thankfully she was very knowledgeable and listened to my needs the s is a great machine makes near perfect espresso i don t call anything perfect and has no learning curve whatsoever if you can follow directions and learn what buttons mean then you can make perfect lattes espressos americanos and cremas too clean up is a breeze which was another one of my big concerns the speed of the machine is unbelievable as well with two boilers there is no waiting at all and oz of on board water means you can make a lot of drinks between re fillsi just can t say enough positive things about this machine but from the control you have over the mixture of water and powder coffee to the water temperature to the ease with which it works to the amount of time you get to spend enjoying your drinks vs working on the machine this machine is the best i have tried cheaper machines to no avail if you are considering this whether it is your first or your last consider the s very seriously 
i bought two more after liking the first so well i ve read the various reviews i can t comment on the experience of other people but here s mine i have a bathroom that can be quite chilly and i thought i d see if a vornado would help it did in fact i liked it so well that i bought one for my elderly parents who tend to be cold almost all the time they use it regularly both in their tv room and in the bathroom it s quite light and easy to transport so they do then i decided to take my bathroom vornado to work since we had some thermostat wars going on and my office would suddenly turn frigid because someone else was too warm it worked again so i bought a third for the bathroom nary a problem it s quiet it heats smoothly and circulates the heat as claimed as a result the room gets gently warmer not the three feet of space in front of the heater with three units purchased at different times i would think i would have come across one of the defective ones that others have complained about but i have not had that happen to me i am very pleased 
good quality smooth operation like the weight in my hand peeling much easier than with my former grocery store model and doesn t take off as much of the food as with my paring knife 
good sheets these sheets are nice and have held up for a year very well there was a lot of fuzz in the wash at first but all of the flannel didn t wash off the flannel retains heat well and are still warm when i come back to bed if i get up in the middle of the night 
good gadget for very little money you get an easy to use and sturdy corkscrew 
tumblers i was pleasantly surprised at how quickly my order arrived they were exactly what i was searching for ! because they are insulated the tumblers don t sweat so no need for coasters to protect the surfaces they are placed on also no need for constantly adding ice to beverages it seems to last forever 
great glasses the z stem is great ! it is actually much easier to hold than a straight stem i wasn t quite sure how it would feel to hold you cannot beat the price either i purchased the pack in the store and liked it so much i purchased another pack now target needs to make the z stemed margarita glasses 
perfect match perfect accessory for any knife set much less a wusthof knife set will also revitalize every pair of scissors in your house ! it is a bit difficult to use with serrated or ribbed knife edges but not impossible 
heavy duty comfortable sheets i feel rich sleeping in these sheets ! they are quite wrinkley but just take them out of the dryer as quick as possible i will have these sheets for years looking just as they do today i m sure money well spent 
excellent condition pleased item brand new and shipped in a timely manner i do wish it was bigger grand pappy through me off thought it would be bigger than it was but it was still what i wanted most important vendor delivered as promised 
simply the best now why can t everything be made this good opens cans and lasts and lasts just what we want only one improvement i can think of stainless steel parts it doesrust 
love seat throw for the price this is a good buy note it is a throw and not a cover 
love them these earthy looking canisters are beautiful ! i have matching dinnerwear and accessories also they look great on my brown quartz counter tops an excellent purchase 
highly functional i purchased this colander for my mother s birthday after the paint chipped on her last much fancier colander what i like about this stainless steel colander its five quarts my mother s last colander only held three quarts which is really inadequate if you are cooking a spaghetti dinner for more than a few people its functional the stainless steel won t break won t chip and won t rust it s sturdy and reliable its more than functional hey the colander has a cute fruit pattern it s unnecessary it s not spectacular but why not ! it adds visual interest to what would otherwise be a fairly basic colander what i don t like about this colander its a little wide its width makes the colander hard to store you can hang the colander from a hook on your backsplash if kitchen space is an issue 
great look reasonable price i purchased sets of these glasses in december they look great have a nice heavy feel to them are of obvious good quality i could not be happier and i m now going to order the larger oz size too if you have any doubts you can forget them now and buy these classy glasses if you like the look of this style you will not regret this purchase 
chicago cutlery walnut pc block set very impressive set excellent quality sturdy good value for dollar spent and offers a nice assortment of knives for general kitchen use dav 
picky mom says perfect rice is our staple food no kidding it really is i have all different kinds of rice bins in my pantry long grain brown rice par boiled rice sona masuri rice and basmati rice i cook rice everyday and i was never completely happy with any one rice cooker in all these years i tried several different kinds sanyo aroma zojirushi etc there was always something with each of these uneven cooking big splatters bottom getting burnt so on and so forth i finally got this one recommended by a friend perfect brown rice white rice and pulav pilaf absolutely no splatters i intentionally put cups extra water and nothing came out rice overcooked but that is a different story even though the lid is not detachable cleaning is easy part of it is due to the shape fancy looking rectangular ones are such a pain i d say crappy design cooking vessel is definitely thicker than most cookers out there never had a burnt bottom even when left on warm for several hours i don t have to crank up my big oven for baking a small cake this cooker does it complaints are really minor weak lcd display cannot cancel timer if you change your mind you have to go in increments all the way to max and then start counting again does not come in bigger sizes 
nice kids pillow my son loves it very nice it is a nice gift for ages below it got a good shape nice grip to hold 
n ice cream spade works very well handle is balanced and fits well in the hands cuts right through ice cream excellent product worth the price for those frozen ice cream buckets that feel like they ll sprain your wrist with every scoop 
perfect all around serving dish this dish is my favorite serving piece in my fiestaware ! i already have it in seafoam it is the perfect size for thanksgiving size side dishes everyday main courses chips rolls or even desserts i especially like the shape it fits into tight spaces on the table and the price is right compare and you ll see it s the best bargain in fiestaware ! i bought this for my daughter who just moved out of the house started her off with a small collection of rose her favorite color 
cool concept for storage and dispensing i absolutely love cereal and i just had to have this cereal dispenser easy to clean and assemble it is a fun way to display your cereals and know how much it left before you need to purchase more there have been way too many disappointing moments when i reached for my box and discovered that i only had less than a stale bowl left ! i also bought this because it was stainless steel note that the base is the only stainless steel part the lids and the knobs are not stainless steel which i was disappointed to find out but made out of plastic with a silver like coating i m guessing that it would either fade or peel off with prolonged use the first cereal i tried it with was my childhood favorite lucky charms unfortunately as i turned the knob some of my oats got crushed by the rubber perhaps i stuffed it too much i also think you could use this product for other dried foods like peanuts trail mix or seeds and alike but nothing big like chips or cheese curls which i am certain would get crushed when you turn the knob to dispense i also find the product a bit overpriced too if the lids and knobs were really stainless steel it would have been more worthwhile however i can t exactly complain when there are not too many competitors out there for this stainless steel product for now its is doable until the latest model comes out 
against conventional wisdom advice i m going against what many home chefs like in an all purpose knife its not heavy german or made of surgical stainless steel these are light knives picking them up is effortless if you uses knives often why get something heavy that promotes carpal tunnel syndrome they are not german i think german knives are overated and overpriced these knives are a great bargain you can get whole sets for the cost of one henckels or wusthoff knife i admit the cheaper steel they use in these knives do not hold their edge as long nor can you dishwash always handwash these these knives rust if you throw them in the machine but they are very easy to sharpen and can get ridiculously sharp using those cheap stage knife sharpeners as long as you handwash and sharpen periodically you can cut with the best of them the secret to caring for your knife is to handwash a light oil cloth and sharpen your knives periodically 
what a great indulgence after reading every review on deep fryers i could find i finally decided on this one it has been great and i couldn t ask for anything better or more easy to use i put it on my cooktop and let my big hood suck away any odors it heats up quickly and the food has always come out great we made donuts after cooking shrimp and halibut with no cross odors or tastes ! my family only tolerates fish so this was greatly appreciated cleanup is easy also after waiting for the oil to cool the pan lid and rack can go into the dishwasher only the heating element has to be cleaned by hand and it is quite easy the oil can be used many times without problems and so it is more economical to use than i originally thought it would be i would recommend this with no caveats 
great leash this is a great item for any night walker blight enough for car drivers to notice you are crossing the street i don t recommend the blinking type those are very annoying i highly recommend the one with solid light i ve tried the glow in the dark leash the light stop glowing before i could finish the walk worst part is they are double the price of the much better atomic leash stars 
extemely large this set is a great value you can turn the sofa into a twin size bed if you wanted to sleep outside this is a true deep seating set it even comes with cushions 
love it love it excellant product that i purchased on line i really love it it matches so good in my new kitchen and i am so proud of the look i definetly would recommend this to my friends i love the style and the retro feel 
excellent product i have been using airbake pizza pans for at least ten years if not longer my original ones are still in great condition i spray the pan with no stick spray before putting the pizza on the pan the fact that cheese can get stuck in the holes is indeed a drawback but the fact that you get a nicely browned crispy crust more than outweighs the inconvenience i make my own pizza dough and bake the pizza at maybe it doesn t brown as nicely at a lower temperature i scrub the pan with a plastic mesh scrubber and dish detergent and let the suds sit on the pan for a while if something is sticking to it a round wooden toothpick neatly removes any cheese caught in the holes i agree that a teflon coated pan would be quickly marred by the pizza wheel since my metal pans are scored from years of use the marks from the pizza wheel do not impact the performance of the metal pan but i would think that they would cause food to stick to the teflon pan 
just what i wanted thank you for offering this wonderful product oh i have other juicers etc but wanted this after searching and looking at wooden ones 
loves waffles after searching high and low for a non belgian waffle maker i decided to try this one make great waffles and love my grilled cheese sandwiches seems the only waffle makers you can find are belgian waffle makers and i do not like belgian waffles this iron is a great buy 
strong little hand blender this hand blender is much stronger than the previous blender i owned the blade is very sharp and a workhorse for its size 
economical great for a crowd if you don t care about show these industrial looking butter warmers are great slight problem is the flame may be a little too close to the bowls so fill bowls well a little instead of a lot will turn your butter to ghee 
couldn t live without it i have had my tea maker for years and use it all the time i have used other tea makers at my mom s and she has went through to my one i rec d it as a wedding gift so i have been looking for one for my mom i only wish they made it in a larger size i usually make it strong enough for quarts and just pour it over into my larger pitcher love love love it 
awesome coffee maker this thing is great i ve had it for about a year and no problems refurbished products are worth it i got this one for half price very easy to use just put in a filter and drop in a tablespoon for each cup you plan to make fill up the pot itself with the number of cups see lines and pour into the back and press on good ish 
great affordable german china german made china that is fabulous i paid per plate a week ago and now amazon lists this same plate at ! of course that is still way below retail but not the great buy i got however you ll like the plate as it is beautiful and goes with any other dishes you may have i bought for use as buffet plates be aware that the plate is almost flat the edge is only slightly raised no design except on the wide edge which is smooth but with discreet dotted design the exact color of the plate itself easy to coordinate with about anything else you put on the table only stars because of unreasonable price increase 
very pleased i was skeptical about spending so much money on a home coffee maker but i figured it would be money well spent if it is well made and will last much longer than cheaper brands we love our a pour omatic it is super fast easy to clean and best of all it makes the nicest smoothest most rich tasting coffee we ve ever had in a home brewer i would highly recommend this coffee brewer splurge you won t be sorry 
best price from amazon beautiful set i can t believe i researched pots and pans but i did and learned many things for these particular pans reviewers brought up some good points for the teflon debate about cancer causing coating these are hard anodized aluminum as mentioned the anolon com website has an earth friendly icon that states they use no harmful materials i will be washing mine by hand to reduce wear and tear for durability they offer a lifetime warranty for amazon s part in my experience with them shipping is always a breeze items typically arrive earlier than promised the manufacturer packed the pots and pans so it arrived in its original box inside an amazon com box with a little extra packing for travel the glass lids were packed well so nothing was broken i bought these from amazon com because first i want to start cooking more regularly and needed a good set for everyday cooking that will last for years a good place to look for the non experienced cook was on macys com where they gave a comparison of the different brands they offered it helped in deciding what type of coating if any would work best for me second the price and ease of purchase original price for this set was sales price when i went to macy s was on amazon a couple of weeks ago was so already far better than macy s amazon also had the piece set for the same price which made the piece set an even bigger deal free shipping and a coupon for more money off the grand total from amazon was for a set that is not bad at all ! i look forward to using these and by all accounts expect them to hold up to their claims of durability the fact that they are oven safe gives me confidence in those claims i rate this set stars for overall appearance weight and anticipation of good cooking and easy clean up if not i promise this review will be amended my advice wait for a holiday sale when you can get the best price the price on this set has already gone up hope this helps 
great towel the towel has served it purpose quite well it is soft looks great and was well priced 
good but my microwave arrived today it was the sharp r model arrived very quickly and i was thrilled with the speedy shipping i can always count on amazon for quick delivery you can imagine my disappointment when the microwave door wouldn t open no matter what we did the booklet was inside the microwave so we had to pry the door with a knife to see what we were doing wrong as it turned out i called sharp and they gave me some names to call for a repair the st place i called said they would need the microwave for a week the second couldn t be sure how long it would be away from here finally i called the third place in franklin ma and we brought it to them when we got inside the repair person met us with a rolling cart brought the item in the back and within minutes had it fixed it was just a missing part so now the microwave is in my kitchen and i tried it as soon as i arrived home and it works perfectly great size lots of power happy with purchase this was the first thing i bought from amazon that even had a hint of a problem 
it pops popcorn maybe one or two kernels end up on the floor perhaps others were overloading it healthy alternative to greasy potato chips 
great little expresso pot this concerns the bialetti class cup expresso pot after becoming addicted to the much too expensive starbuck s caramel macchiato but living too far away to have one daily i happily discovered this small expresso pot the amazon reviews sounded encouraging so i ordered one it s amazing ! i use sugarfree vanilla syrup nonfat milk frothed with the aerolatte milk frother another wonderful product and sugarfree caramel sauce and when combined with the expresso made with the small pot i have an even better tasting drink than starbuck s in less than minutes i like it so well that i ve ordered the bialetti class cup for when i have guests both are made in italy of heavy gauge stainless steel and are very handsome incidentally my husband bought a bialetti musa cup for me but i had to return it it leaked around the seal when making the coffee it was made in india and although it looked very nice the steel was a lighter gauge or it was possibly made of aluminum i don t remember for certain and i didn t like the handle or lid opener button nearly as well as the class version 
pizzelle pro we enjoyed using the prego pizzelle baker very much it heats quickly and evenly it is so much like what grandmother used 
excellent quality attractive and does the job i ordered one of these gates to fit a large opening between the foyer and living room prior to ordering this gate i was using ugly plastic garden fencing to keep my little dogs out of the living area this gate looks terrific it was easy to put the pieces together it s sturdy and i was so pleased i ordered more to block the dogs from other areas of the house it s very easy to step over too probably wouldn t work for large dogs or hyper little dogs that jump but my little dogs see the gate and walk off and ignore it 
norpro deluxe cherry stoner pitter i was inpressed stoner worked well on all size cherries got all stones as long as you did not fill hopper all the way i put to cherries in hoppper at a time and help direct them to plunger you can do a gallon of cherries in about minutes 
it is the magic stars ! excellent ! excellent ! excellent ! this is worth it ! they have restored my faith in paid programming ! i love this product ! it s strong and powerful ! i use it almost everyday for protein shakes and mixes ! i love it 
vary comfortable these pillows are excellent it gives me a perfact neck support although size is little smaller but it serves the purpose 
nice item overall this is a very nice item i have been using it to make mojitos and it works wonderfully the only negative thing i have to say about it is the handle could be longer 
le creuset tagine i have found this to be valuable addition to my kitchen i am interested in mediterranen cooking and this is a traditional form in morocco this is a low fuel cooker never used above a medium setting on a cooktop and used to simmer for long periods on low or very low uses very little liquid with the unique tagine shape do not overfill or you will have a mess this is a great way to make stews and braises ! long cooking allows flavors to mingle it cooks for but is not big enough to serve large groups unless used in a multi course meal a bigger size would be nice to add would love to have more recipes 
best damn fryer on the planet this is a well thought out product for consumer use easy to clean easy to use tried others and was very disappointed but i m extremely pleased with this one some advice stay away from the euro pro 
great for long lasting fun i d been looking for a good durable chew toy for a long time and have heard rumors about the kong it became a legendary toy in my mind until i finally saw it in my local pet store and bought one for my toy rat terrier as soon as i got home stuck a treat inside and now it s marcello s favorite toy ! this ll surely keep him happy while i m away at work too 
gorgeous this is a very handsome set on my countertop the tools are very well made and have exceptionally comfortable and sturdy handles my favorites are the omelet turner and the ball whisk which makes whipping up gravy on the stove a breeze the little hooks on the exterior of the basket canister are very useful for a peeler measuring spoons etc happy with this set kudos to wmf 
archie s favorite my cat loves this toy and so do i when his energy level is through the roof and i m too tired to run around the room any more i pull this little boogie out and he s in cat heaven while i get to sit in one place and laugh at him battery is quite long lasting i ve been using it daily for six months now and haven t needed to replace it yet 
my kids love the mickey wafflemaker we went on a disney cruise recently and my children had mickey waffles almost every day for breakfast i checked online to see if they had the same wafflemaker but this one was just as good my children love having mickey mouse waffles i make them at least once a week it s easy to use easy to clean and the waffles are ready in about seconds they also give you some recipes for specialty waffles i would recommend this wafflemaker to anyone who enjoys mickey ! 
took tries the first set came very very broken i sent them back and got another set just fine 
great suction but a bit disappointed in attachments i have indoor cats and a cat allergy i was excited by the dyson in the hopes that it would help keep my allergies at bay after a ton of research i chose the dc complete specifically because it had the attachments i wanted and was cheaper than the animal despite being the same exact thing i wanted a low reach tool to be able to get the cat hair and god knows what else from under my bed and the mini turbine tool to clean my furniture after receiving my dyson which by the way has a mo warranty rather than the day in the listing i did the whole vacuum with old then vacuum with new test i had a amp bissell cleanview which worked well but the dyson did manage to pull out more hair and dirt from the carpet not tons but enough to convince me that my bissell was leaving dirt behind next came the attachment test the low reach was great ! i loved that i could get under my bed easily however i am seriously disappointed in the mini turbine head the brushes stop rotating when you put the attachment onto the fabric ! well what good does that do i thought i was using it wrong until i read some other reviews thank god eureka makes the power paw ! it does what the turbine tool promises but doesn t deliver at least the power paw brushes continue to spin while cleaning the fabric and for the price was right plus it fits on my dyson overall i m happy with my purchase but definitely want people to be aware that the mini turbine tool is worthless as an attachment 
not bad the steel finish on these picks are not matte like in the photos but shiny more like chrome cosmetically over time they get scratched up when used to get into the nooks and crannies of hardshell crab functionally though they work well 
small but powerful we have been using this heater for over a month now it is a powerful little heater i wanted to get a ceramic heater because i read they are the safest space heaters you can buy this is important because you here a lot of horror stories of space heaters causing fires the heater has three settings low high and auto ranging from watts of electrical power on the low setting the heater puts out watts we usually use it on auto where you set the handy digital thermostat to a set temp and the unit maintains that temperature you can either set it on the unit or by using the handy included remote control i was surprised to see how well this unit heats about a square foot space i would recommend this unit with confidence my only issue with the unit is do not expect it to save you money over other space heaters i e oil filled electric radiators my electric bill seems to have gone up using this heater over a previous oil filled electric unit by the same manufacturer i will say that this unit does heat the room much better then the previous unit largely due to the fan dispersing the heat 
metal grapes napkin holder i purchased this for my sister in law for christmas she totally loved it so therefore i m happy with it too ! 
great looking and easy to install wall mount wine glass rack we ve had a built in bar for over years and always had the countertop cluttered with glasses since we have a very high ceiling in the bar we needed a rack that could wall mount and get them out of the way we ordered of these racks on dec rd they were here by the th and on the wall the next day now we can entertain having what we re serving on the bar instead of our stock of glasses service was great through this seller kegworks we got delivery tracking emails to let us know where and when our shipment was and when it would arrive would definitely recommend this product and this reseller check out the picture we uploaded to see for yourself 
good it s the first slow cooker i ve owned and i have cooked one meal with it only today but i like it already it s and it s basic no power light for example which feels odd for any kitchen device but it has a good quality internal white ceramic pot and glass lid three settings keep warm low and high and nothing else no timer no automatic way to switch from cook to keep warm i had read that some slow cooker lids rattle while they re cooking but happily that problem did not show up on low cooking anyway i cooked a meal for eight hours and it did not show any signs of drying out so i think it will be fine for leaving on low heat during the work day the internal pot lifts out for serving and it cleaned up immediately i put it in hot soapy water size is fine for two or three servings i m now kind of glad i could not get the breville slow cooker good reviews but much bigger and out of production and opted for this because it s small and simple but it does the job ! 
typhoon professional cook s wire skimmer this item is very well made and will last a lifetime easy to handle to get food out of hot oil without hands being close to the heat great to have around if you ever deep fry food 
perfectly elegant the size of this elegant little sugar bowl is just right unlike an earlier reviewer i found the spoon to be quite adequate and very nicely shaped but then i don t use teaspoons of sugar either i like the mirror finish with the brushed finish inside and the slot for the spoon so that the lid fits perfectly i m now eagerly awaiting the companion cream pitcher 
a functional piece of art the toaster is beautiful and works beautifully no preheating no need to watch just set the timer and push the lever the only drawback is that it gets a bit hot while in use but i suppose all chrome toasters are like that makes perfectly consistent toast every time finally it looks magnificent pricey but you are acquiring an objet d art in your kitchen 
nice thermostat we installed this about a month ago it was very easy to install and set up the touch controls are intuitive so you don t have to drag out the book every time you want to reset it it holds the heat at a very constant temperature so the room temp doesn t go hot and cold like our old thermostat i like that if you overide the current setting which is very easy to do it automatically goes back at the next schedule change you don t have to remember to put it back on its schedule i d recommend it to someone else now while ours is new 
tiny but functional a nice one two cup tea pot will work for an every day cup of tea 
i will buy again at amazon blinds were what i expected they were very good quality and low price too shipping was excellent and on time 
buy for youself get some for gift giving wine server looks great and ends the drips ! what a great hostess gift for the price 
excellent blanket i purchased the same blanket for my son and myself it was worth every penny and was as good as all the other reviewers said it is soft and plush and very warm even though it is not a thick blanket i bought this blanket based on the other reviews and am glad i did i highly recommend it 
works great yes like the other reviewers say it works just as you d want it to work i do have a few nits to pick and hence the four stars that i don t recall anyone else mentioning the cord is really short i suppose it s designed that way so it can be stored in the base but it only extends from the base may or may not be a problem for you depending on where your outlets are the temperature adjustment knob feels really cheap a friend of mine said it feels like it isn t attached to anything i agree but in fact it is i just hope it s more durable than it feels unlike the waring pro wmk this has no spill tray the plastic base is just bowl shaped to contain spills and crumbs i didn t really have any spills but a removable tray would be nicer if not as attractive made in china not that i m opposed to china getting my money but until china does more to protect its workers and environment i prefer my money go to countries that do better on those fronts just my the description is incorrect the waffles are across the top and across the middle my favorite topping so far is sliced frozen strawberries thawed of course and fresh real whipped cream elena lisa i followed the instructions to apply oil with a pastry brush and never had a stuck waffle personally i hate aerosol cooking sprays they work but it s impossible to confine the fine mist they produce to the cooking surface and i rarely want to oil my stove or counter top according to calphalon they use a propellant that can make cookware harder to clean i can t confirm the latter but i know that they get an oil film on things i don t want oiled 
great bowls these bowls are great my husband loves them the shipping was on time even though i ordered the week before christmas 
geat curtain the hookless shower curtain was so easy to install that it didn t hurt my arthritic hands it hangs nicely and on the rounded curtain rod doesn t try to cling to someone in the shower while the water is running 
excellent i purchased this item for myself and when my husband saw it he wanted a set for his cook on the boat i use it everynight when cooking good job mario 
sensible and easy to clean this is the perfect size for most uses in the kitchen especially for crushing spices or herbs the mortar s non porous surface is also great since it will not absorb odors or flavors like stones or wood might the pestle has a rougher end unglazed that makes it easy to use and best for even crushing with little slippage 
best cat toys ever my cats don t like to play with many toys but they love the crackle noise this toy makes i had to buy one toy for each cat one cat will start playing with it and the other will try to take it away 
it s the cats meow we have wonderful felines only two are strictly inside and two are inside outside the rest like to stay outside the inside and inside out cats love their gym and so does thier mom the cats have a full size condo gym inside and the outside cats have a full size cat condo gym in the garage i bought the cat gym because of the size i wanted something smaller to have down stairs and this worked perfectly i have had to reassemble a few times due to thier playing quite vigorously knocking it over and just plain knocking things apart but it is simple to put together they have a ball on this little gym and have brought us much entertainment with thier antics for the price i feel it is wise purchase especially for inside only cats it appears to be made of a pvc type of tubing very strong one would have to hit it pretty hard to break the parts after playing they curl up inside and on top of the gym and take naps it comes with two toys that you attach and i added a couple more of my own overall i think it is a great form of exercise and the cats really have fun the veternarians i work with have purchased these also 
very happy with purchase these mortar and pestles are used mainly for crushing perscription medicines they work very well for this purpose and are great for traveling since they are light weight an excellent product 
smart buy this product is the best on the market others don t come close with teenagers you have to have a clothes system that works this does 
best wedding present my husband and i recieved this as a wedding shower gift we use it all the time it is a great thing to have for entertaining we ve had it for two years now and it works great we get many compliments on it and will be giving it for gifts in the future 
spiegelau will work just fine spiegelau was acquired by riedel a year or two ago and is quite similar to the riedel vinum glassware which sits just below riedel s high end sommelier series these glasses offer exceptional value the difference between the spiegelau and the riedel is less in the quality of any individual stems both are well made european machine blown crystal than in the fact that riedel offers a broader range of glassware specifically designed to enhance wines from particular varietals eg cabernet sauvignon pinot noir or from particular appellations eg burgundy bordeaux if you are simply looking for a basic red wine glass and a basic white wine glass the spiegelau will work just fine however if you usually just drink barolo for example you might wish to invest a bit more money in a riedel stem specifically developed to enhance the bouquet and flavors of that appellation however the most important thing to know is that these are excellent quality glassware that offer the major advantages of crystal over regular glass a thin lip and a microscopic pores in the glass that effectively increase surface area increasing the area from which the bouquet can launch 
great blanket the micro suede blanket is warm and light weight it is not a bulky blanket i really like it and if anything ever happens to this one i will get another micro suede blanket i have had alot of blankets over the years but this is the only blanket i can say this about 
classy toaster we purchased two of these toasters we ve been using the first one for about a year and have been completely satisfied usually we hide our small appliances under the counter but this toaster so classy in its retro way that we keep it out all of the time we just purchased the second one as a wedding present so hope the newlyweds like it as much as we do 
lovely if u like frothy coffee and hate washing ur coffee machine or dont intend to buy one now this thing definiltey makes up its almost like a motorised superfast whisk and u must not fill the cup more than half or u can pretty much swirl the coffee out on urself but once u get the hang of it u will fall in love with it i like it 
puppy playpen this is a really nice pen for puppies or older dogs it is a great item to have when you do not want your furkid underfoot i bought mine to put my pups that i am selling in when people come to look at them it would be nice to find a bottom pan that would work for this especially when using it for pups that are not potty trained i recommend this to anyone with furkids 
best cat toy on the market this interactive toy is stunningly effective in motivating the hunting instinct of your kitty ! my two both are spellbound by it and it really gets them racing round till they re panting great for exercise and stimulation of indoor cats i will order this again and again such a change from the usual toys that they get bored with so quickly 
loved them the flutes are absolutely great ! exactly what i wanted and even better than expected i will be purchasing more of these shortly 
great knives great item i would reccomend them for anyone in the market for new cutlery 
the best i received this le creuset quart round french oven as a birthday gift and it is perfect in every way i cannot recommend enough the overall quality of le creuset products they are also very attractive and add enjoyment to all forms of cooking this particular quart round french oven is a great size and shape and can be used for a variety of things it also fits perfectly upon the le creuset trivet other products of similar quality you might try are global knives and cuisinart appliances you won t be disappointed 
love it this pan is the best ! nice heavy weight great size can grill large or medium sandwiches at the same time ! 
aerolatte review it works great the travel one is all you really need forget those other self standing more expensive models 
great nip just got it as a add on to an order and found that my cats really liked it all you have to do is open the bag and they come a runnin 
great machine i have been using this mill for years and expect to be using it in more years i bake loaf of bread twice a week with flour i grind at the same time the bread is simply the best we have ever found and fresh the machine is very very loud but it gets through enough flour for a loaf of bread in minutes no big deal others are more quiet but this excels in quality and ease of use 
sooo yummy if you love garlic you have to have one of these ! it s so easy you just cut off the top of a big clove and put it in upside down with a bit of evoo and it smells and tastes delicious ! use the cloves for just about any dish mashed potatoes vegetables even steak 
not bad for the price we have not assembled this yet but did get and assemble an identical one in oak the same comments apply to both this coat rack is not as nice as one we got in england which unfortunately toppled and broke after years service but it is functional and my husband likes it the british one had rounded solid hooks and no plastic this version is a bit more like a cheap imitation with bentwood hooks and a plastic umbrella holder but it was a good compromise when i could not find a top quality replacement and for the price it was well worth trying out but you do get what you pay for ! so far it works ok but ask me again in winter when it s laden with heavy coats 
gas burner covers this is what i was looking for to cover my other burners while i cook but the depth of the covers do not reach down to the stoves surface you can tell that they don t fit the burners but it is covering them and i will deal with that for the price that they cost 
pretty alright this little scale does the trick nothing fancy just simple to the point weighing of the goods its nice to have the storage container but i never really use it i just like to know its an opption 
return of broken dishes just wondering when you think this item will be sent thanks 
works well and can be cleaned completely the best thing about this deep fryer is that all parts could be taken apart and cleaned it works well and is safe but it fills my house with greasy smell it was a lot more than just deep frying on the stove top also it was a little too big for a family of four considering the amount of unusable oil i had to throw down the drain i will still use it for recipes which call for a deep fryer with good ventilation 
vacuum cleaner bags i was pleased to get exactly what i wanted in a few clicks and a few days 
excellent this is a great pillow for cervical support and stretching it s cotton and washable and worth the price 
delivers on promise i bought this kettle for our office since we needed boiling water for tea and such it does everything we need and it s pretty we haven t had any problems with it and it s been used several times a day it works like a charm 
great product for home kitchen this is a great pitter for your home kitchen it works of the time for me the other of time i have the pit remains within the cherry as it fails to get punched out i still give it a high rating since this is a mechanical solution which depends on several factors such as the size of the cherry medium size works best the speed and amount of pressure you punch the pit operator skill can improve the success rate the one negative comment i have is that the pitter get rust very easily and it comes without instruction on how to clean it i found out that if you let it sit for drying after a handwash it will get rust what you want to do is to take the pitter apart wash and dry them with a towel immediately after use you can take the assembly apart by simply uncrew the black pitter handle the spring and the metal rod can now be pulled out for cleaning enjoy 
very cool i think this tem is very well priced and very nice for dog 
floormate works great you can use soap a drop and water with it but for best results use the hoover cleane 
my husky can walk again due to missing link plus this product is phenominal ! i heard of this product almost yrs ago but didn t actually try it until spring when my year old husky started limping severally from arthritis she could hardly walk and kept holding her front right paw up and limping the vet put her on rimadyl pain meds for weeks she still limped after weeks i heard how bad rimadyl was on a dogs liver etc so we didn t continue with this medicine i decided to try missing link plus with glucosamine and in weeks she stopped limping completely krystal is still on missing link plus i give her tsp s daily sprinkled in her food she s more active now and acts like a younger dog she s even thinner and looks great it also helped eliminate her constant ear infections i have my yr old husky on this now i have also used this for several foster dogs a boston terrier that had hip replacement surgery and a lab mix pup that has demodectic mange i would highly recommend trying this product for any hip arthritis issues for younger dogs not needing the glucosomaine for hip or joint issues i d get the regular missing link w o the plus always consult with a vet first though not all vets know what this supplement is so it never hurts to take in a package or print out the ingredients and info from the internet but this product is awesome it has helped my husky to walk and run pain free again it eliminated constant arthritis visits to the vet and i don t have to put her health at risk with a long term pain medication this product usually sells for in pet stores for lb bgs amazon has this for way under this is a steal of a price and well worth every penny especially if it greatly helps your pet live a healthy life again 
so far so good it s still brand new so everything s working great i really love the color i bought it to match my yellow standmixer 
a wonderful oven mitt an excellent product ! they work exactly as advertised they re good looking and comfortable as well as functional 
love my comfy new chair this chair is really easy to assemble but you have to kind of work a little to get the wheels in the directions were not really helpful but its basically self explanatory when you put it together it has great lumbar support i have a herniated disc in my lumbar spine and this fits the small of my back like a glove the price is kind of misleading the shipping charges were more than they had the chair on sale for the chair was on sale for and shipping was its still worth the i paid alltogether 
first to review what you pay for is what you get hello all amazon users first person to review this item leaves a so so favorable impression the image is deceiving as you do not get a glass lid with the wok handles are not wooden but rather stubby iron wings that you grab on to other than that this sucker is heavy good in the send that when you are actually stir frying your stuff you are not moving the wok around the base is pretty thick so heat will be uniformly dispersed what you pay for is what you get i can t complain add on the off purchase so it s a good deal 
great machine for the price i bought this machine years ago with the thought in mind that even if it worked for a while we could see how much we would actually use an espresso machine and still not have to spend a lot of money i worked in a coffee shop and was used to all the perks of a larger machine but for at home use this machine is great it doesn t make double shots and you can t steam while making the shot or adjust the steam but for the price it s been well worth the money we have used it at least once a week more often to times a week for years making to drinks during each session just recently i did experience the same problem as described by others where the frother no longer works i opened the machine up only one screw on top under lid where you insert water resevoir and sure enough the hose had come off replaced it and it s working again just some pointers i do think it s very important to have the proper grind of coffee i grind my own also important is a proper tamp and no coffee at all around the edge of the filter for a good seal i even get a great crema cleaning of the machine is also important i clean mine with a good wipe down of the nozzle and filter head after each session used and once in a while with a descaler running it through the frother as well as the filter maybe i just got lucky with this machine but we have really enjoyed it and even if it quit working tomorrow we ve still gotten more than our money s worth 
makes my global as sharp as the day i bought it what are other people are doing to their globals with this sharpener mine works extremely well and makes my g very sharp in a matter of a few minutes trust me i am as bad a knife sharpener as anyone could be in fact this sharpener is part of the reason i bought my global in the first place i can only guess that using a light even stroke and making sure that the knife is straight up and down in the sharpening slots is important to the sharpening technique also the sharpener doesn t work on many non global knives because of the weird bevel global edges have so don t think it s going to work on your wustof unless you have a professional re cut the bevel to a global stylebuy one follow the directions and you and your globals will be very happy 
excellent coffe maker this coffee maker is perfect for our office especially the automatic feature the coffee maker we had previously was a pourover type no one wanted to be bothered making the coffee when they took the last cup now its so much more convenient ! the hot water spout is really a nice feature for those who drink tea hot chocolate or cup a soup for lunch we have been very pleased with this machine and would recomend it 
good value for the dollar the main thing about this product is it is good value for the dollar the item is inexpensive and gets the job done with a large cooking area and adequate features there are a couple of features that could be better but of course you are going to have to pay more to get them such as a less hot to the touch exterior and as already mentioned the timer cannot be turned to stop but the temperature can be turned off so not a big issue 
not a gimmick the real deal the riedel o concept glasses may take a short while to accept but once one realizes that a quality wine glass does not require a stem the rewards are many the o glass line of products have made legendary glass maker riedel s products affordable for the masses while injecting an element of practicality for daily use as a current owner of both traditional higher priced riedel stemware and these newer products i find our o glasses are getting much higher use they truly do enhance the flavors of good quality wines while helping the wine drinker collect multiple glass ware designs at reasonable prices i now have five different o styles on the shelf yet these wide mouth chardonnay glasses seem to get the biggest workout they somehow do have the capability of bringing out the nuances of a wine even for us less sophisticated buyers plus my wife loves popping them in the dishwasher ! 
o k product shipped in timely fashion i knew what the product would be and am happy with it 
presto popper this is one of the best units i have ever used the care of the powercups is a bit tricky but just let cool and wipe with a dry cloth and you will be fine we love this unit because we have little mess and fresh popcorn instead of microwave popcorn in a bag which tastes nothing like the fresh popped corn i love to add spicy salt to my oil before adding the popcorn which will lightly cover the popcorn to create your own unique tastes i highly recommend this unit 
a great training tool i have a stubborn dog and this worked great i tried it on my self and it didn t really hurt as much as it was just startling and there were no after effects from the shock no lasting pain of any kind i am ordering another one for my second dog 
great juicer after plenty of research on the internet i decided to go with the omega i ve used it almost every single day especially throughout mt pregnancy to make sure i consumed green leafy vegetables everyday this is a great juicer and i like it better than my vitamix for making hummus i didn t give it stars because i don t like it s grinding ability with small quantities and i think it could leave drier pulp 
great value these are well made and look and perform great easily a five star product 
best alarm i ever had i don t know what the person with the one star was talking about but was so wrong this alarm is very loud not only is it loud when it goes off but the light flashes on the one that is going off i am actually gonna order another one best one i had ever since i already had tried several ! its a must to get 
matches perfectly with fiestaware i bought the plates bowls cups etc to go with my fiestaware because i like to mix and match my patterns to create a colorful festive table to suit my mood for myself or entaining dinner guests the colors are actually more vivid and brighter than the pictures show on amazon and the merchant s website i have tangerine sunflower cinnabar persimmon scarlet and shamrock in the fiesta this set would also go well with the periwinkle and plum colors as well hopefully they can find a way to create a more accurate picture of the colors i have had the santa fe set for a few weeks now and using them in microwave and dishwasher is no problem that said if you like to mix n match colors with fiestaware or want a nice sturdy dinnerware set with lots of color than this santa fe style is it 
nice liquid soap dispenser i like this soap dispenser because it s big and i don t have to refil it often when filled up with detergent body lotion or what have you it gets heavier and won t move when you press the pump the advertised non slip base really works the top part of the pump itself is big enough so that you don t necessarily need your finger to push it like when you already have a sponge in your hand or something you still can get the pump to work by pressing it with the side of your hand forearm etc the pump is made out of plastic and you won t end up with a yucky stinky gunk on your hands like you would if the pump were made out of metal has no metal details on the base so no rusty bottoms that leave nasty ring stains on your countertop it does what it s supposed to do everytime you pump the pump meaning you get a fair amount of whatever you have inside the dispenser simple as that ! 
great stir fry my girlfriend and i absolutely love a good stir fry beef chicken seafood it doesn t matter we eat it all this pan does a great job at cooking and browning the vegetables perfectly 
anti bark dog collar this is a great product we have a toy beagle who barks in the car at people kids bikes dogs and pretty much anything we use the collar on him maybe times and now he hardly ever barks in the car we still use the collar once in awhile we are going to now try it when we walk him and take him to the beach so far we like it a lot 
wonderful at last a strainer that will not tip over in the sink when you fill it to the brim 
a lot of fun for a short while this was a lot of fun its big and different from my golden s other toys and it makes a really unusual sound not a squeak but a honk if you will the problem came when my golden took to destroying it and eventually ripped out the honker this is of course inevitable with these toys so be prepared to supervise your dog s short playtimes with this toy and to mend it several times to extend its lifespan 
i love my black decker open itall center i bought the open itall because i am beginning to have arthritis in my hands i noticed after i opened jar lids that my hands often hurt it opens all kinds of jars with ease i really hadn t planned on getting an electric can opener but decided to spend a few dollars more to get the combination and i am delighted that i did i haven t used the bottle opener but rarely used one anyway the price i paid is well worth it to help protect my hands no regrets at all i highly recommed the product 
great use of minimal space i really like this dish rack ! it holds a surprising amount of dishes i bought this for the cup holder prongs good use of space the flat tray underneath and the utensil holder and have not been disappointed i don t use the drain board with it put a dishtowel underneath and wish i could have opted not to have that included the only concern is that there is nothing at the one end opposite the utensil holder to keep things from falling off i have to be careful not to put anything precarious like a bowl there for fear it would tip back and fall off i just make sure to put a big plate at the end also larger cutting boards don t fit in it very well but i still give it stars because it is just what i was looking for 
fiesta ware canister i love the canisters they are a nice size and have tight fitting lids 
works great remember to clear by spraying upside down until clear this works great put your favorite oil in pump and spray this doesn t produce as fine of mist as pam spray but it still produces a nice even coat a little more blotchy than pam but i get straight oil none of the stuff they put in pam dont forget to clear the nozzle when done by holding the spray bottle upside down and spray until the pressure is gone this will clean out the intake tube and prevent the dribbling as the star poster mentioned do this in the sink so you don t make a mess it is also a good idea to clean this occasionally run some soapy water through it and then rinse until no soap comes out the nozzle i am very happy with the misto oil sprayer and it works great for bread baking this doesn t work great for keep the bread from sticking to the a deep bread pan use pam or equivalent for this works better but it is great for misting the top of the loaves to prevent them from drying during proofing i reach for my misto almost every time i cook 
this baby is incredible i would certainly highly recommend this juicer to anyone ! it is stylish sleek easy to clean and has plenty of power to handle anything i feel sorry for michigan mix apples and a handful of baby carrots for a great drink ! awesome ! awesome the first negative credit for this must be a lazy ol prune who wouldn t be happy with anything ! get it now ! 
great tray the ice cubes come out intact not chipped or cracked to get them out push each cube from the bottom with your finger for fastest and easiest results wait for minutes after taking the tray out of the freezer this way the ice cubes will pop right out if you don t wait your fingertip will be freezing while trying to push them out 
this danby is a cold winner i bought this attractive little appliance for use in an airplane hangar where the occasional consumption of perishable food and cold drink storage is desirable this quiet running compact fit the bill perfectly some designs in this class of refrigerator are barely capable of holding six packs of canned beverage why bother this fridge with cubic feet of internal space is generous enough to store a reasonable amount of perishable food stuffs just don t expect too much utility of the freezer though as its capacity is quite small the internal layout of the danby is well thought out and the vertical beverage stack on the door is a welcomed plus the upper portion of the door also includes a special clear plastic insert to accomodate up to eggs but is an easily removed option you can even change the direction of the door swing by swapping out the reversible hinges sized at a reasonable across the top of my danby refrigerator perfectly accomodates a small microwave oven and the combination of the two is hard to beat when eating a casual meal miles away from the full sized comforts of the home kitchen 
taylor wireless thermometer this thermometer is convenient and easy to read having the indoor outdoor temperature info easily accessible in such a weather changing place as denver is great 
good value i ordered the white seashell pottery dinnerware and am very satisfied i had years of multi colored dinnerware and decided i wanted something simple yet attractive and my husband and i love the ocean ! a nice change of pace was the fact that there were no cups saucers just mugs and a large size at that 
excellent specialty knife when i began collecting wsthof trident classic knives twenty years ago i chose the basics first cook s knives parers slicers utility knives steak knives boning amp filet knives i acquired them one or two at a time always on sale because this cutlery has been an expensive investment when wsthof added a tomato knife to this line i bought it even though i wasn t sure if i would like it or use it a lot now i recommend this inch tomato knife to everyone its serrated edge hasn t needed sharpening ever and it cuts slices dices and chops fresh tomatoes so quickly the forked tip is great for taking out the stem ends of tomatoes i ve never used my tomato knife on anything other than tomatoes which is why i think it has stayed so sharp i use my inch serrated bread knife for slicing bagels and breads and my inch serrated utility knife for cutting citrus and other fruit also i hand wash and dry this knife and keep it stored in a wooden block 
everyone wants one of these we have this rack in our rv and everyone who sees it wants to know where they can get one it holds quite a few dishes for it s compact size it folds down to just a few inches of space to stow under the sink while traveling i can see it would be very handy for those in limited space like a small apartment or dorm room its plastic but pretty sturdy when it gets a little gunky from all that accumulates in the bottom i run it through my home dishwasher but you can just scrub the bottom under the rack to clean it up 
tremendous value couldn t be happier with this cookware set heating is even very good performance in the oven for finishing pieces are well balanced and easy to clean hand wash only we waited a long time to replace a myriad of unmatched pots and pans we chose well with this set 
clean classy design i ve owned this flatware in this pattern for three years i paid top dollar for each place setting so this price is exceptional the picture of the flatware here doesn t do it justice you have to see it and feel it in your hand to truly appreciate the quality and craftsmanship the combination of shiny and brushed metal is both eye catching and elegant it s a clean and classy design we use this flatware year round the hostess set is nice too but the serving spoons have such large bowls they are slightly goofy looking 
fixed our problem our two and a half year old son was just potty trained and couldn t quite make it through the night we had a smaller pad on the bed but it would shift and move and never give us coverage this pad is perfect ! fits wonderfully and easy to toss in the wash would definitely recommend it 
nice idea for spices this spice rack works great in a drawer it is a simple design basically just a thick piece of plastic bent to make the spices lay on an angle i reused my square target spices with new labels it s beautiful ! the spices are tucked in a drawer next to my stove so they are easy access while keeping my kitchen uncluttered it was reasonably easy to install my drawer isn t as long as the rack so i had to get out my handsaw and cut it down a bit it suggests this in the directions unfortunately the rack wasn t cut squarely so i also had to get out my sander and sand down part of a side it was about a off and wouldn t fit into the drawer but after i did that it fit very snugly and now works well 
follow these tips for a unique coffee every family in italy owns one of these machines here are a few tips in italy this is not called an espresso machine but a moka machine an espresso is what you would drink in bar made with a steam or high pressure machine with the crema on top smaller size moka machine tend to make better coffee never wash the moka with detergents just rinse it under tap water you ve gotta use it often for a good coffee if you haven t use it in a while make a weak coffee lungo and discard do not put the moka in the dishwasher use drinking water avoid tap water especially if very chlorinated never compress the coffee for a strong coffee fill the filter with ground coffee and make a small cupola that slightly protrudes beyond the rim do not press down for best coffee heat at very low heat it s ok if it takes min as soon as coffee reaches the top remove from heat do not let the coffee boil use good quality coffee not too strong medium grind try illy for a good commercial brand sip while still hot enjoy 
le creuset quart cast iron oval french oven flame the le creuset name is synonymous with quality thus i had no doubt that if in fact the item i was purchasing was le creuset that i would be satisfied with it s beauty and performance my concern then was is this actually a le creuset answer yes it is ! perplexing the situation was the amazing price i hoped i was not going to receive a used le creuset well surprisingly so when my le creuset quart cast iron french oven arrived it was new in excellent condition matching the rest of my le creuset set perfectly and i am a very very happy granny cook thank you le creuset and

great knife i would recommend this knife to everyone the occasional cook to the top chef it keeps a sharp edge is very balanced is a handy size and useful i am always reaching for it 
wonderful i just purchased this set and love it i have been looking for a stainless steel salt and pepper shaker for some time but didn t want to pay a premium price this fit the bill and as a bonus i got a cocoa and cheese shaker as well the large size makes them easy to handle while cooking and they make a stylish piece placed on the stove top i don t believe they will clog any worse than the average salt pepper shakers as all will clog when exposed to moisture the bottom hole for filling is easy and convenient for the money they are an excellent buy 
great deal these sheets are a great deal they are very soft and comfy they are oversized a little therefore they fit very nicely 
great clips love the quality strong magnets and usefulness of these unique shaped clips highly recommend 
corningware success the mug alone costs so the kit for is a bargain i love the mug size its handle and vent lid i would prefer an on and off button for the warmer but it does keep my coffee warm i don t know if i ll ever use the lunch bag but it is well made 
he can t put it down a great combination toy that allows him to enjoy the visual stimulation of feathers and the ability to grip the plush carrot body don t think it s just the catnip that makes him go crazy over this toy 
excellent quality i was pleasantly surprised at the quality of this roaster considering the price it s also larger than i had imagined and will easily hold a good sized turkey the first meal i made in it was roast beef with vegetables and it tasted great and cleaned up easily dont let the word aluminum deceive you this roaster is cast aluminum and is therefore very heavy i d guess it s pretty much indestructible 
love my brother i have been sold on brother for years and this machine is no exception ! i purchased this machine just before christmas and have been having a ball with it it is so easy to use i know i will want to eventually upgrade to an even nicer machine with even more bells and whistles some day by brother of course ! 
very nice beautiful canister i purchased one in each of the three sizes they look fantastic in my kitchen highly recommend 
ok for nyc water nyc water clogs faucet filters fast i ve tried a few systems and so far this one has lasted the longest it ll go for a month before it needs replacement not the full four months brita claims but the other brands i tried lasted less than two weeks i ve had the system for months 
the largest thickest thirstiest bath towel i have ever seen i was never a fan of thick bath towels they never seemed to be very absorbent until i ordered wamsutta towels for my wife i will never use anything else if she leaves me one 
good blades nice feel i was surprised at the quality of these knives for the price i was not prepared to spend a rediculous amount of money on a knife set with a blade for every plausible occasion this set has the perfect number of knives and each one feels natural in the hand although this set comes with a sharpener i recommend getting the wsthof knife life knife and scissor sharpener you will not need to sharpen these knives much but that sharpener will make your life much easier and will renew every single pair of scissors in your house i also recommend as others have to never place these knives in the dishwasher also be sure to washt hem by hand and thoroughly dry them immediately after use this will drastically increase their longevity if you purchase these and i propose you do so then get a travel roll bag for knives this is because you will want to take them to friends and family s homes to show them off 
wonderful product great value i needed another toaster for our ski lodge i ve used dualit chrome toaster for many many years and just loved it when i went to amazon com and saw a dualit lite toaster at i was in awe of the price ordered it and just love it perfect even toasting american style pop up toaster and can accomodate my favorite bagels i can t believe that you can purchase a quality dualit product at this pricepoint i highly recommend that you go out and buy this item i m going to get several as holiday gifts

m j in ga the sprayer works great i put olive oil in it and use it like pam but with the extra chemicals so it doesn t damage my calphalon cookware pam eats away the anodized finish but the sprayer is just olive oil so it doesn t you just have to pump the misto periodically oh yea the price was half of what it is in the stores thanks amazo 
best dehydrator out there for the money i have only gotten to use my new gardenmaster once so far but it is great ! i have a fd from about years ago with trays that i have used many times a year i ve always wanted the tray professional model but couldn t justify it because my old one still worked fine well i was ordering a jerky gun for a christmas present so that became all the justification i needed i have trays for mine at the moment and i was able to do my whole allotment of beef jerky at one time where it would have taken different batches with my old one all i do is beef jerky and it usually takes me about hours per batch with my fd and it took the same amount of time with the gardenmaster but with full trays ! you can t beat this ! everyone always wants me to make jerky and it is very time consuming but this certainly makes the end result get here faster do yourself a favor buy one 
really enjoying this purchase i have used this about six times so far and it s been great i like that it comes with the two bowl size options it s quiet and simple to use 
nice quality daybed bedding set the quality is very good however the unipillow cover is longer than the two king pillows suggested to put in it so it sags in the middle not sure if one of those unipillows would work better the shipping time took about weeks which was consistant with the shipping time listed the packinging showed a different daybed cover set than what i purchased and received so i was concerned at first that i was shipped the wrong order but it turned out fine 
these hepa replacement filters also fit the hamilton beach air cleaner model although it doesn t mention it these hepa replacement filters also fit the hamilton beach air cleaner model i had to email hamilton beach to find out but they were very helpful and responded right away when the filters arrived from amazon i saw that on the box it says fits models with our cat and houseful of antiques we always seem to have dust bunnies floating around i run this model in our office under the table which holds the computer since placing it there i have noticed the buildup of dust around the modem is almost entirely eliminated i placed the larger model in our living room and it certainly is doing its job the regular settings can be louder than expected but i leave them on the whisper quiet setting when we re in that room and i don t even notice them being on i would definitley recommend the hamilton beach air cleaners 
i can still have kids i have had a lapinator for six months now and it has performed exceptionally it may not do much but it does it well comfortable and lightweight it works well while travelling or just as a desk to allow ventilation the rubber pads adhere well and provide a decent grip virtually all heat is absorbed as a bonus any future children of mine will have this device to thank for allowing me to retain the means to procreate them my only concerns the questionable product name that seems hokey for a device of such simple elegance my apologies to the inventor who contacted me after my purchase and seems quite nice and the size which does not allow me to pack it in my laptop bag but that is to be expected 
well worth the price i bought this pillow because i wasn t completely satisfied with another foam pillow that i bought nor was my husband this thing is great my husband liked it so much that i ordered him one too they hold their shape better the only reason i didn t give these pillows stars is because they aren t quite high enough for us but we just use the other foampillows we bought to raise them a bit and sleep better than before 
love it i love it a great purchase quality and function makes me smile 
loved by cat very quiet easy to refill this is the first fountain i d bought but our year old cat kept making a mess in the old water dish by pawing at the water with her front paws while this was cute it made a mess got the fountain she immediately abandoned the old water dish and now drinks much more water good and doesn t splash in the water at all just drinks right where the water flows out she loves it so much yelling and following me around the whole time i refill or clean it until it is back the reservoir can be removed with water still in it without spilling water yeah you might spill a little when putting it back but it is okay with me it is pricey but highly recommended if you really love your cat ! 
chantal ounce tea steep red this is a great product and the color makes it elegant 
great product this is my rd pressure cooker the last higher end products broke within the st year with just average use this pressure cooker is simple basic and so far withstanding the abuse super fast shipping 
best decision i ve ever made except marrying my husband this is a wonderful wondeful little machine it s small enough to fit but large enough to do a good size load warning though human error can occur don t forget to put drain tube into sink floods may occur grins sheepishly if i could rate stars i would 
for the best design i wish these would go on sale like the heart version it is so much fun to poke the cookie dough off through the hole in the handle dook 
good coffee quickly i was amazed at how much i am enjoying my flavia fusion i saw it at a boat show and tried some my husband talked me out of it because he wanted to surprise me for my birthday i really love it i love the decaf house blend it is hard to find really good decaf or to brew good decaf decaf tastes bad after it sits for minutes so you waste a lot if you brew a big pot of it the flavia is a total solution to getting good and hot decaf coffee i also like the regular coffee and the decaffeinated tea as well i like the fact that there are so many choices of drinks it surprises me that people who have bought the machine and written some reviews touting how expensive it is to use it because of having to buy the coffee on line should have done their research before buying it it is obvious that brewing individual cups would be somewhat more expensive than making an entire pot with store bought ground coffee the flavia is a luxury item not for a poor working stiff anyway the flavia is fast and simple and convenient in fact i m going to make myself a nice cup of coffee right now enjoy it 
i love this item no more coats thrown on the sofa i am very happy with this coat tree it is beautiful and a great price i have been to several furniture stores looking for a coat tree they were over priced bulky and ugly the twist style cherry finish wood coat rack stand was delivered within the secheduled dates great condition easy quick assembly and adds character to the room i love this stand ! now no more coats thrown on the sofa 
efficient and easy this is a great product very basic but does the job boiling water qite efficiently it s also easy to store in a cupboard i like the european design make sure you order the correct size because this water kettle comes in two sizes water boils fast 
for the money you can t beat it i have to agree with everyone else save one reviewer i love this piece of furniture it s a lovely piece and for the money you really can t beat it and i even got it off ! i m no help when it comes to the ease of putting it together my fiance handled that for me however the one reason i gave it four stars instead of five is because the predrilled holes on first buffet that was shipped did not line up correctly and we had to get a replacement one shipped to us this was taken care of by target in a very accomodating expedient manner as one other reviewer pointed out it is petite take careful note of the measurements all in all i love it the coloring of the wood is beautiful and it s a perfect addition to our dining room 
i loved this product we just got our zojirushi gourmet duet dual mug personal coffeemaker this weekend we used boca java blended coffees and our well water we live in the boondocks the directions were simple to understand the amount of coffee that fills the cups was perfect we used regular filters not the unbleached kind i was stoked ! this is a great cup of coffee ! we have used coffee makers that didn t perform like this i definitely recommend this 
works fine for us my partner and i bought this crockpot and the lid fits fine we have not had any problems with anything leaking out we ve used this product for soup stew and a bunch of other recipes they ve all come out great 
fun glasses i love riedel glasses and these are no exception these are great for casual wine drinking week day dinners or just a couple of friends drinking and chatting sure they don t have a stem but i rarely hold the glass in my hand the entire time i have a glass of wine so the wine doesn t heat up anyway elegant but durable they fit in the dishwasher and they are spill proof if i set a fancy table i still turn to my beautiful stemmed wine glasses 
great hand towels and even better a bargain we just love these absorbent towels the fluffiness and absorbency get even better after washing the colors are bright and we could not be more delighted and the price oo la la just lovin it 
good basic coffee maker if you re looking for a good basic coffee maker with a timer this is it ! not expensive not fancy but works and makes a decent cup of coffee i was attracted to the price and the b d brand name i have several other b d appliances as well as tools and i m happy with them all 
great product this filtration system has changed the taste of my tap water into something worth drinking i am happy with it and recommend it highly 
just what i was looking for i am very pleased with the desk the only complaint i would have was the assembly the instuctions were alpha numeric coded however only one piece had an imprint so it took sometime determining which piece was which but once put together i am very satisfied it is not too small not too big just what i was looking for ! 
customer service how about customer overservice i purchased the rival bbq crockpot and once it arrived for a friend as a gift i was filled with envy and wanted one for myself i thought that service charges were high however the smalls were swift vigilant and dedicated to resolving my concerns not only did the refund charges we spoke as late as this week and my sole purchase was well over a month ago if i receive this service from a one time purchase can you imagine what a repeat customer gets your lowest price store is just that i probably could ve taken my behind to walmart but i really got to know a couple that run a business with the customer in mind and will dare i say be the next walmart 
excellent item this was exactly as expected and an ample size it looks nice and is a better value than some of the cheap too small stainless steel ice buckets available out there you ll need some tongs though i would not place it in the dishwasher due to the way the knobs are attached threaded holes but it is very simple to clean being stainless 
great item had this for over a year with two small boys the fruit bowl keeps this from toppling even when my two are climbing up on the counter to get bananas my children ask for fruit more because i keep it out on the counter and they love getting taking the monkey s bananas the glass bowl is well protected by the rubber stoppers inside and the metal frame mine does not have so much as a chip even with two toddlers being able to reach it on the counter expensive but durable 
use it all the time very hady not only for deep frying in the wok but for fishing raviloi and other pasta out of a large pot of boiling water instead of straining a must have tool in the kitchen and for the price you really can t go wrong 
spiffy silicone spatula there weren t a ton of reviews for silicone turners and i took a chance with this one it s pretty much what i was looking for it s got a nice solid and durable feel to it good heft a little pliable but thick moderately broad and not floppy isn t going to damage my nonstick pans and hopefully won t leech toxins into my food since i ve been concerned that plastics might and the company logo in the metal s cute classy 
excellent quick grill for the kids adults i purchased this so that my year old wouldn t use the stove on his own i wished i had bought one of these years ago for myself it cooks evenly and the meats retains moisture the only drawback is cleaning it other than that it s a great product 
xmas salton s hot spot warmers were a hit with both of the adult computer users who received them consistently hot beverages at your elbow these gifts earned sincere thanks and were put into use promptly the switch on the hotplate as opposed to on the cord and on off light were cited as winning features hotplate housing allows fit of average mugs operational cons nothing beyond common sense contents of cup gets warmer as the level drops don t let the mess on your desk avalanche over it during operation etc salton hot spot earns stars from my corner of the world 
magazine rack basically i really like it but it is too small for my needs it is of good quality attractive and durable 
jerky lover s treat it is excellent for making jerkies from ground up meat i am a vegetarian but i bought this tool to make dog treats it is very easy to use and it really makes good jerky thats what my dogs tell me 
great coffee if you like great coffee the french press is the way to go and the bodum press is one of the best 
good item but read the manual for the poor folks who are complaining about the eee display i haven t had the same problems customer support for this has been really professional and prompt at the number the eee problem is a result of people not reading the instructions about not immersing the control panel in water don t do it the panel is electronic and electronics don t work when they re filled with water this unit is a good solid fryer which i ve had no problems with the pros easy to use easy to clean up nothing has baked to my frier or my friends friers death by eee even when frying trouble items like pastry or breaded items the basket comes clean easilly the controls have positive engagement and are hard to accidentally push the unit makes a loud beeping when buttons are pushed and has a distinctive alarm you shouldn t leave the frier unattended but you have enough peace ofmind that you can work on other things in the kitchen while the fryer is working another bonus is that suggested cooking tempetures are printed right on the unit so when the manual gets lost you have some idea what did what the window is also a lifesaver as it lets you see what the oil is doing just in case anything goes wrong the cons the power chord is the most annoying bit and can be plugged in upside down don t do it it says this side up clearly on the chord but if you are absent minded or have limited eyesight this might be an issue the only other problem is that the controls the power button faces the frying basket this is more of a pet peeve then anything but if you need to get control of the unit in a hurry you do not want to be reaching through hot oil splatter my suggestion keep it on it s own power strip so you have yet another button in case of emergency sadly this gripe applies to almost all friers i also wish the lid was a bit better designed the lid drops the inevitable condensation from the water into the oil until you get used to tipping it out towards the basket handle once you get the hang of it the condensation dropping into the oil can be avoided this frier despite a few minor shortcomings is excellent one of the nice features is that it heats up quickly and can maintain that heat even when adding and pulling out food the caution to that is that when the oil is disagreeable it heats up quickly be sure to supervise the frier i managed to do the boneheaded thing of chopping up mushrooms washing them and tossing them in without thinking about it and managed to cause quite a show in the kitchen had i actually read the manual there s a blurb in there to make sure food is completely thawed and dried which i did not heed if you respect the power here it s a great unit 
top notch works just great a plus is that the gray frame surrounding the toasting slots is metal rather than plastic i also like its appearance style so much better then those forever retro look toasters on the market today boy am i tired of that look so if it keeps on toasting i am very happy with it 
press your own clothes no more dry cleaners i have now had this product a few months and it has already paid for itself vs cleaner launder and press bills works very well just wish it had a little larger surface but for the price it can t be beat gets extremely hot and with steam will press most clothes without the addition of spraying on starch unless you really want that stiffness starch is not necessary 
dishes the dishes came really wrapped securely and nicely i appreciated the sender and the carefulness no broken dishes the product was sent quickly great service 
we like our dualit percolator bought our dualit percolator before i read all the negative reviews have to disagree our works perfectly seems to be very well made makes good strong coffee and keeps it very hot like we like it easy to clean also we also purchased one for a friend as a gift and they are pleased as well 
love these plates i searched for a long time for plates to replace our every day china after years we were down a bunch of pieces and i didn t want to pay for the replacements i ordered sets loving the shape and antiquing in the photos they got here in days not a single chip or break the color is better more creamy than it looks in the picture and i love the weight and feel of it there are a few minor imperfections a very small bubble here or there but nothing that will harm the plate or user and i love that they are all slightly different i ordered one set to keep aside to replace breakage kids but i love them so much i may order another so i get a good decade out of them 
terrific little vacuum this little upright vacuum has more than enough power to reallyclean my one bedroom apartment and it really cleans the suctionpower is strong and i am impressed with how much dirt is collected my little eureka mighty mite was just not doing the job obviously lightweight amps powerful easy to put together and easier to use i totally recommend it hope it lasts a long time i will definitely buyanother hoover the price is amazing a great value 
top notch humidifier i also purchased the air oswiss after first buying the vent sonic which appeared to be a knock off of another air oswiss model that bed bath and beyond no longer carries the aos eloctronic humidifier is more than i needed but the cheaper manual knobs wasn t available i thought the venta sonic was in fact the manual model of the aos and bought it as it looked similar to the pictures of the model when i opened the package i realized right away that this was not worth and reading through the one page instructions found that it was not the aos it is pretty cheaply made and did not generate much mist and the fan could barely get the mist more than a foot from the nozzle a big problem was that the vent sonic unit splashed so much water under the container that water leaked out between the base and the container leaving a puddle in just minutes i took the venta sonic back and bought the aos which has an electronic buttons to regulate the fan and moisture what is great is that you can set the percentage humidity and the unit will reach that amount and stop sending mist it also shows the current humidity level since the main purpose of a humidifier is to add humidity to the air but not make it like a rain forest the electronic info is very usefull the aos works like a dream even though it is pretty pricey but a full nights sleep every night is worth an awful lot it is extremely wel made and designed while it is there are discounts available from bb b for 
nice but deadly we opened these little bundles of joy early for a christmas party my year old room mate was delighted with the thought of having her own cocktail shaker and a pretty one too ! moments later the joy was shattered which it often is by the slicing of flesh and an ensuing bloodbath followed laughing hysterically at this funny but painful folly i decided to put the top on her cocktail shaker myself to my utter amazement and sheer surprise i too sliced my finger open ! thank goodness our trusty manservant was on hand to administer bandages and comforting words ! so let this be a warning to you be carful the lids are sharp a special thank you to brabinger the butler there is a reason why people should not be mixing their own drinks and should rely on a trained professional ! 
great glasses what s to say great look great shape very nice wine glasses i honestly don t know if my wine tastes that much better in good glasses but it s certainly a pleasure to drink from them good quality for a very reasonable price i will add that if amazon did have a problem with shipping them intact they seem to have solved it my glasses arrived securely double boxed totally intact 
wow factor my twin boys just had their rd birthday and i did their room in thomas the tank as a surprise when they walked in and saw the huge thomas on their full size bed it as really a wow factor ! great colors 
feels great no complain ! felt very good to touch wormed me during very cold nights i wish if i had more options in the choice of color 
rustic baking dish this quart round casserole with lid is a small but practical sized dish to add to a le creuset collection i m a longtime collector of le creuset pots and pans and flame is my favorite color for them i love the new poterie stoneware line baking dishes ramekins pitcher and the crock for utensils the colors are great and they match the pots and pans perfectly i use this red casserole dish when serving family style at the table and it s perfect for storing frozen or refrigerated casseroles for quick reheating on busy weeknights these poterie dishes coordinate especially well with fiestaware dishes and serveware and they make colorful additions to festive buffets they are freezer safe microwave safe ovenproof up to degrees f and can go in the dishwasher 
exceptional value and quality i have wanted a nice soft down comforter ever since we took a cruise and had such a nice one on our bed unfortunately before this one all of them were out of my price range i was hesitant to order one this inexpensive figuring the quality couldn t be that great boy was i wrong my husband looked at it on our bed and asked me twice are you sure that s what you paid for this it is soft it is luxurious it s just a fine quality comforter i hope to get another one for our guest room before amazon wises up and charges more for this wow ! i m very happy with this purchase 
a little smaller than our last press but it sure beats ironing we had a press made by singer that finally gave up the ghost after more than years after a several days of ironing clothes with mixed results a lot of frustration we researched presses on amazon based on customer reviews we decided on this press and have not been disappointed the press is ready to use as soon as it s out of the box operation is simple all but self explanatory and it heats up very quickly it is a little smaller than our previous press but not so small as to be a drawback clothes are ready in no time compared to ironing the press comes with a water spray bottle if you prefer not to use the steam feature definitely worth the money spent 
i m so glad i bought this i ve had this for over a year now it s perfect ! i had always found cooking rice to be very tricky my husband even bought me an electric rice cooker but that doesn t seem to work either the rice seems too hard not all the way cooked what s great about this steamer cooker is that you can adjust the cooking time because you put it in your microwave the booklet gives you a range and i have found i need to use the maximum time listed i only wish it listed more options it just lists instructions for cup raw rice and cups raw rice i d like to see how it would work for less to be able to make one serving of rice but i guess i can experiment with it whats also great is you can use it for steaming vegetables it has an insert that keeps the veggies above the boiling water the instructions say you can use it for pasta too though i haven t tried that pasta in the microwave just seems wrong somehow but rice in the microwave works great ! if you re looking for a foolproof way to cook rice you should get this product you won t be sorry 
magnetic knife holder i purchased this knife holder for a commercial application in an upscale restaurant where the kitchen is visibile to my customers i like it becuase it works well strong magnet will hold large blades including my cleaver it looks cool leave it to the french and my health dept inspector liked it too because it is a cleanable stainless steel unit it mounted easily and all shipping etc went smooth 
great little instant read thermometer i have this thermometer in black and it s been great important tip to note stick the metal tip into item let it sit for a couple of seconds and then turn on the thermometer do this and you ll get the instant read feature if you turn it on first the thermometer will show the temperature of the air then you stick it into the item and the display will slowly move to the temperature of the item this takes a bit of time so be sure you stick it into your item first let the metal acclimate to the temperature of the item and then turn it on then you ll get the instant read each time ive washed this i ve dropped it and it s still going strong it s not a replacement for an oven thermometer or a probe thermometer but it s great at what it s designed for a quick and easy instant read thermometer 
most beautiful cocktail glass i ve ever seen i ve yet to find a finer looking cocktail glass a friend who doesn t even like martinis asked me to make one for him after seeing one in this glass it looks that clean and perfect 
works great i just bought a bunch of these for christmas gifts i ve enjoyed using my friend s the true test came when i went to peel a butternut squash it took the first layer off with no effort whatsoever and i only had to go back once to take a little more off with a regular peeler i had to do it two and three times incredibly comfortable in my hand too 
travelling made easy we take our frozen concoction maker with us on numerous trips and this makes that much easier 
best trash can ever i bought mine last year when we remodeled our kitchen and it is still working great and looking fine ! smooth operation never a fight with can when pulling trash full trash bag out ! keeps odors in and cat out ! love it 
great product saved substantially from amazon i was able to save a great deal of money compared to the retail price great product and service 
works great i haven t used the dryer since i got this it holds a little less than a full load but i have an extra large front loading washer i may get a second one 
t fal avante toaster we have one of these in each of our kitchens and we like them very much 
multi cat jungle gym large my cats love playing in it the youngest ones use it to play hide and seek every day i on the other hand am afraid it is going to tip over when they jump on it it has not yet but it wiggles a lot ! it is too small for my cats over pounds 
so far so good we ve had the super toasty for about one month very good for our needs toasts very well evenly and quickly perfect small size for our counter matches well with our black and chrome applicanes no temperature setting is the only drawback but we don t miss that much 
mrs anderson s pie crust shield saves the day i love this product ! i have been waiting all week for it to arrive and it finally did today ! i baked my pie ive been anticipating this moment for days and when it came out of the oven there were no spills to clean up ! and my crust lets just say it was a perfect golden brown light and flaky mmmmmmm 
love this unit have of them we have one at our house and two in the office works like a charm and the design is sleek and simple too bad cuisinart isn t making them anymore 
great product happy wife this mixer has proven to be as good or better than she had thought it might be she has already made a lot of different baked goods much more easily than before she loves it so i recommend it 
crazy circle just got this a week or two ago and to our surprise they seem to enjoy chasing the big yellow ball around the circle good size and fun to watch them play 
great little piece at a teaser price i have to say that i am very happy with my all clad ltd pieces including this little fry pan because of the price i picked up this one and the qt sauce pan to give them a try my family used to cook with the all ss line so i knew that these would be quality and i was not let down yes stainless is more difficult to cook with but have you tried hard anodised pots impossible that s why my equally beautiful imo calphalon professional pots are looking great as kitchen decorations and not much else your food will only burn if you are not paying attention to it if you are having this problem try non stick so you can go do whatever else it is you want to do other than paying attention to your food if you are looking for top quality cookware that is oven safe lasts a lifetime and demands a little more care from the chef this is it 
not as soft as expected but tightly woven for durability i ve never heard of a thread count and the price was so good i couldn t resist the weave is so tight i ll bet the water beads up in the washer before the soap gets in and breaks the barrier ! i do have to say that they re not as soft as i expected although they are fairly soft but perhaps with a couple more washings they will be much better i ll bet that they will last a lot longer than general to thread count pillowcases and through a lot more wash loads so i still think this is a great deal 
calphalon piece block set review received my piece contemporary block set with santoku knife just under one month ago i read a lot of reviews and checked out my top three choices at the local gourmet kitchen store before deciding on the caphalon set the finish on the calphalon set at the store wasn t quite as nice as the higher priced wusthof and henckels but i just couldn t justify the additional cost given the limited amount of time i spend in the kitchen the handles are comfortable to hold and use and the blades were all very sharp straight out of the box haven t had do any sharpening yet the labels on the butt of the handles ensure you get the right knife everytime the block is well made with a nice finish including the calphalon label despite my lecture regarding care of the new knives my wife has managed to run at least two of them through the dishwasher so far this has made no noticeable change to the appearance of either knife in summary i d say i m quite happy with the calphalon knife set it s a great buy for the money and i still look forward to each new opportunity i have to use them 
the best yogurt starter i had purchased the euro cuisine yogurt maker about a year ago then just recently noticed that euro cuisine came out with their own brand of starter i have to say that using the starter made the yogurt making process so much better because the ingredients they use in the culture is so healthy and it makes the yogurt so much more delicious i already fell in love with the euro cuisine yogurt maker now i have fallen in love with their starter as well 
awesome book light i like this book lite becuase it can flex around very easily it has a brite lite if it s a hard cover book it will easily clamp on and it has a handy switch on the back of the lite 
wonderful i love these knives they fill their need and with the full tang they are nice and sturdy 
great vacuum for the price this vacuum was very reasonably priced and the suction is phenomenal ! it puts my old vacuum to shame every carpet in my house feels flufflier after vacuuming with this vacuum at first i thought it was my imagination but the next day i felt it too now on to the problems one of the side wheels came off the first time i used it also the wheels underneath left grey skid marks on my floors and lastly you have to buy the hose attachment i didn t and regretted it the first time i was using this vacuum it s really a necessity and should come with the vacuum i have since ordered it and am awaiting its arrival 
dog food storage great seller but this item lid does not fit like our straight on top lids which we love also would suggest the next larger as this will not hold an entire bag of science diet 
great item love my butter bell visited a friend of mine this summer and she is a butter lover and english so she had one of these and suggested that i get one to keep butter spreadable works great suppose to keep it fresh for month without refrigeration 
great bowls these bowls have been in my home for a few years now we have used them for cereal in the morning for warming up food in the microwave they are nice looking and very functional when we needed another bowl when one broke we knew we would get another fiestaware bowl 
love the remote hygrometer i ve had other humidifiers but this is my favorite the digital hygrometer prevents over humidifying ive ruined the paint on my bedroom wall several times when other humidifiers over humidified the room overnight also like the easy to clean heating element finally i had the reset problem that other reviewers discussed but when i read the owner s manual more closely i realized that the reason for my problem was that i was not waiting for the water to filter through the system before starting it the owner s manual recommends waiting minutes between filling and running the machine don t know if the problem other reviewers had was different than this if so i haven t had the problem they ve had i love that i can leave this humidifier running unattended and not worry that i m going to have to get out the paint rollers again 
featherweight lightweight bissell a vacuum it s convenient very lightweight easy to use and has very good suction it is kept handy and used every day to pick up crumbs dust etc on our hardwood floors it s very easy to empty the bagless container we had hoped that this vacuum would have a thicker brush to protect new hardwood floors since it is advertised as a hardwood floor vacuum we assumed it would have a soft brush that would gently touch the wood floor instead it has hard plastic wheels with a short firm brush it hasn t scratched our new floors yet but we worry and try not to press down when we are vacuuming the floor 
fulcrum multi flex book light light works great easy to use clips on back of book 
very nice it is a very good piece for this price i got one minor defect in one of the chairs will try to contact the customer service but am lazy a great deal altogether 
piece children s flatware set this is a wonderful set of silverware the picture on each piece is not only cute it appears to be dishwasher safe as well the fork is shaped slightly different than the other wmf children s forks we have but my daughter seems to love every piece of it excellent purchase 
surprisingly cool i have sworn by air conditioners since i was a child keeping it cranked on high all day and night to keep me as cool as possible in otherwise hot conditions however having recently moved out from my parents i was faced with the dilema of air conditioners high energy costs not to mention the cost of an ac itself i was at first disinclined toward the window fan having never used one remembering all the slow oscilating fans that did nothing to cool me off well to my suprise it drops the temperature in my room so low i need a blanket just how i like it this units design allows one side of the fan to intake cool air and the other to exhaust hot air at the touch of a button or have them both do the same thing which adds greatly to the convience this is a huge plus cinsidering most window fans i have seen require you to manually take the fan out of the window and turn it around to exhause air all these great features accompanied with a low price tag and low energy costs less than an air conditioner and the lazy mans ir remote make this one fine package that as it appears so far will get me through the hot summers cooler and cheaper five stars does what it says it can do and very well now i am going to my bedroom better put on a sweater 
buy this one ! powerful and deluxe best price on amazon the dirt devil extreme power stick cordless vacuum really performs ! i did square feet and it was still going strong bigger collection cup than others and this dirt devil goes easily from the bare floor to the area rugs or carpet without a hitch i have a lot of tile with area rugs and some carpet every other vacuum i have had sucked up the area rugs and had to be lifted onto them and avoid the edges this vacuum just rolls right on and cleans them corner to corner ! i leave the brush on all the time since we have large hairy dogs the hair does not build up in the brush because suction is strong enough to pull it thru small footprint stores on charging base lightweight and easy to assemble and use it has dual filters so there is absolutely no emission smell and the outside filter that protects the inside filter is very easy to clean then all snaps right back in place the best stick vacuum out there 
flip it is awesome as a military spouse we move and have different types of floors that need cleaning i have hard floors pretty much througout every room in my home and also in our previous home abroad the vaccum side does not work well at all but i prefer to do a good sweeping first no matter how i mop in comparison to sponge and rag mops this leaves the floor pretty dry and the suction is great as long as you empty the tank and keep it clean and use just a minimal amount of cleaner in the clean tank it works wonderfully it s about half the work then regular mops and cleans twice as good as regular mops and swiffers that generally just push dirt around i believe it s worth the i ve had mine for two years now 
good value i am fairly pleased with this end table i purchased two end tables for our family room to match the coffee table i very much like the style but wish the table was an inch or so taller the quality is only ok i did notice minor scratches on one table after only a month of use but considering the price and in comparison to other end tables in this lower price range it is a good deal if possible i would have graded it as stars 
love this mug i ve had a set of of these mugs and love them they are green rather than clear they hold just the right amount of coffee and the flared top helps prevent accidental spilling unless you like to fill your mug to the brim i m looking for a replacement for one of them which had to be disposed of because the bottom cracked when it was left on a mug warmer when it was empty looks like i may have to buy a complete of 
great product ! can t go back to regular boxes i started buying the littermaid back when i owned cat i have since grown to a cat family and have had several units i recently purchased the designer series we had megas and one unit did stop working after years but what do you expect with cats that each can on the average use the box to times a day i have read many of the reviews and can see why some folks would be disappointed do not expect this to be something that requires no maintanence you do have to manage and keep up on it it is advertised as no more scooping not not more cleaning ! the motor is not as loud as some of the other reviewers have mentioned the cats acclimate very quickly to it with proper care this will last you years ! i also have just seen the latest product littermaid elite with a steel rake and ionic air cleaner i would have tried that one has i known it was available looks like they made a few improvments on an already great product 
scooba by irobot i bought this on a lark to save myy wife and i a little time what the heck it works great the cleaning solution is a bear to find locally so i opted to use solution of simple green and it works as well or better than the clorox that comes with it 
lots of settings and it works i am delighted with the fan and just ordered more for my bedroom and sunroom the fan has a smaller profile but is substantial enough to stand up to my giant breed dogs tails on the lowest setting the fan keeps my x room cool and i am only slightly aware of the noise a hum generated the fan was very simple to assemble it involved inserting screws to attach the base to the fan although i don t use the remote it may be useful for others the lcd displays the current room temperature and the desired room temperature i like using the buttons and lcd versus having knobs or switches to adjust settings and the settings are incredible the speed levels are high medium slow and automatic on the automatic setting the fan automatically adjusts the speed to achieve desired room temperature be warned that this fan is not whisper quiet certainly not at the medium or high level there is a distinct and constant hum but set to high the fan blows papers off my dining room table which is feet away that s a lot of power to expect silence the wind levels are normal the wind speed is constant natural the wind speed resembles nature wind and shifts among slow medium and fast and sleeping wind the wind level cycles from fast to medium to slow until stopping at the selected time im looking forward to using the natural wind setting in my bedroom it will be like having the windows open which is impossible here during the summer months the timer can be set for between minutes and hours at minute increments you can also select between oscillating and stationary whats not to love 
star wars sheets and comforter i am very satisfied with these sheets my child loves them yes the sheets are alittle thin but mine child doesn t know or care about that make sure you wash them and the comforter in cold water only ! they will last longer if you do this after a couple of washes the sheets will get alittle softer just remember that you are buying this for your child not you 
they really do work bought these not too long ago i use them all of the time they do a great job on towels men s under clothing permanent press clothing cleaning rags not microfiber never soften those etc i find the drying time is a little less the clothes do not tangle and they smell nice and clean best of all no chemicals if you have clothes with a lot of static cling then you can throw in maybe half a dryer sheet to reduce that problem i love these little guys recommend them to all and especially chemically sensitive folks 
works pretty well but wrong size adapters i was really annoyed for a day or two when i got this because it definitely did not fit on any faucet in the house and none of the included adapters worked either i have a pretty standard kitchen sink so it shouldn t be this hard i did find the correct adapter at a local hardware store for and since then the filter has worked well we have a weird problem with some compound that smells like gasoline in the tap water in the sf bay area this removed most of the smell and taste so in that respect i m pretty happy 
i m ok with robots taking over the world if they also do my chores i m ok with robots taking over the world if they don t mind doing my chores as well ! this robot is perhaps the best purchase i ve made in years we have hardwood floors and pet hair tumbleweeds that we were not able to reach but were able to see not only do we have clean floors now but i barely have to do anything probably the only thing it doesn t do is empty itself you also have to occasionally make sure that the junk on your floor doesn t clog the brushes just like any other vaccumme you also still have to pick up the stuff on the floor if you expect it to vaccume underneath but it just gives us an excuse to keep our stuff tidy coming home each day to a clean house has been awesome ! i just can t wait until they get a robot that will clean the shower 
disney cars microbead pillow i ordered this for my son for christmas he loves it ! the service is great and the quality is also 
finally nice soft butter i have been using this butter keeper for months now and it is definitely one of my favorite kitchen products i hate rock hard butter so i love the fact that i can have nice spreadable butter any time i want furthermore i can modulate the softness of my butter by placing the keeper in different parts of my kitchen by the somewhat drafty cold window for firmer butter or on the counter for softer butter i have not had any problems with it and i am going to be ordering another one for my mother 
best floor cleaner yet i have several rooms including my kitchen that have white shiny ceramic tile floors with white grout no matter what i used to clean the floor i had to dry it as i cleaned and most often within a day or two it looked hazy or smeary since using this steam vac i can go well over a week between cleanings and the floor never looked better the steamer removes surface dirt from the grout so if you re buying it primarily to clean grout expect to still have to use elbow grease or chemicals it is too messy to be practical for cleaning windows and it didn t do very well cleaning soap film off the shower door it did however do very well on mold i also love it for cleaning my jewelry and the silk plants in my freshwater aquarium ! no more brown spots on the silk plants best part of all the things i ve mentioned no chemicals to inhale or contaminate the environment the unit is sturdy heats up quickly and includes a lot of handy attachments 
great for pancakes this griddle does a great job on pancakes but i ve found that it s a bit slow for sausages and bacon it s easy to clean fully immersible without the cord and non stick and although large easy to store in my small kitchen where it sits above the microwave ready to be used for pancakes 
quality knife if you want good quality along with good price this set of knives gives you the answer they are sharp sturdy and very comfortable i just love them 
very functional even for the rice challenged i bought a rice cooker because i have never been able to make decent rice in a pot yes i know it s been done for centuries and is supposed to be so easy this rice cooker is exactly what i expected perfection in all but two ways you can make up to cups of rice but not less than i didn t realize that when i bought it i have occasionally made a lot more rice than i needed depending on the rice sometimes the bottom layer of rice gets a little too much heat ie crispy this doesn t happen with japanese rice which is my favorite it does happen with cheap rice it hasn t been that big of a deal compared to undercooked or overcooked rice these are minor things 
one touch we received this model as a gift from dear friends after having cooked rice for decades in a covered saucepan on the range this is terrific ! just put in the rice salt and water press down on the start button and wait for the cook light to go off it takes about minutes just like on the range top and produces perfect rice plus no more guessing no more checking and no more occasional overcooked rice as i must admit to when i used the old way in the past 
great value this is the first dehumidifier i have owned so i really can t compare it to others we bought it to take away some of the damp smells that seemed to come from our finished basement this thing seems to have done the trick run continuously it wrings out the moisture quite well making a noticeable improvement after only a couple of hours run on the range settings you can specify it to come on only when the humidity reaches a certain point allowing you to save power we haven t noticed much of an impact on our electricity bill the only drawback is the thing is a bit loud but not any worse than a window unit style air conditioner 
fiesta ware i am a big fan of fiesta ware i love the variety of colors and the cheer they add to my dinner table my husband even gets a kick out of the dishes enjoy ! 
elegant pattern i received this pattern for my wedding anniversary this past year i am very pleased with the set it is elegant enough for company but is great for everyday use good quality stoneware at an amazon com price you can t beat it 
bad to good the first warmer i got the porcelain was broken in places i notified the company and there was no problem sending me another one anyway as stubborn as i am i glued the first one back together and the coffee was warm at best i really like my coffee hot and the second one will do just fine coffee was much warmer 
how to make the perfect cup of cuban coffee i have used this model of bialetti cup coffee maker for years this is the exact model my dad used when he showed me how to make cuban coffee cuban style coffee is very similar to italian espresso both are made from finely ground espresso beans but is sweeter and stronger the manufacturer includes an instruction booklet but if you ve never made coffee before it could be a little confusing at first buy yourself a stainless steel creamer and a set of espresso cups add four heaping teaspoons of sugar to the creamer follow the instructions in the booklet to make the coffee when the coffee finishes brewing add two teaspoons of coffee to the creamer stir the coffee and sugar together until it forms a consistency similar to mousse it will be dark at first but will lighten as you mix it now add the rest of your coffee to the creamer and stir until all the sugar dissolves pour immediately into the cups and serve you should have enough to fill two cups the coffee will form a nice thick head on it just like a pint of guinness enjoy ! 
visual wine decanter very pretty space efficient and the design allows for good aeration of the wine this was a hit the recommended knob i ordered was the only miss 
best in show i dont honestly know where i first found mine but i fell in love with it immediately you never have to struggle with the cork my parents recently discovered a love for wine and as a gift i was going to get them one of these well to my suprise there is not a single shop in a mile radius that carries this everyone still uses the one step approach or worse yet the auger approach five stars all the way 
great size quality and colors this plate is the perfect size for general use the colors are great the quality is amazing and they stand up well in the dishwasher and microwave plus they are made in the usa 
excellent choice i would recommend this knife set to anyone the quality is great the look is great and these things are very sharp nothing bad to say about them 
doggie gate the quality of this product is very nice it s not as high as we thought it would be but it will satisfy our needs for keeping our pet enclosed in our kitchen area when we are gone our neighbor will be tending to our dog while on vacation and we needed a gate for a wide doorway 
i did it i made great beer what can i say it works ! the trickiest part is assembling the unit so as to contain pressure i had to assemble it twice to get it right but the patience paid off once you are past that hurdle the rest is simple my beer feremnted quickly and clarified nicely the directions are straightforward the beer tasted real good like a true microbrew very clean and light with a distinct hoppy aftertaste and the stock formula had quite an alcohol kick ! wow the unit suggests bleach cleaning but everyone else on the web says beware i picked up some formulas and one step cleaners from mr beer that should work fine in the beer machine 
love this mitt and oh that magnet love this silicone oven mitt i have had no issues with heat conductivity and it is extremely resistant to stains also love the magnet that allows for refrigerator hanging all in all just a great item that i use all the time great colors too 
everything good you have heard about this can opener is invariably true ! wow in a nutshell the gold standard for the price of tinas can openers go there are none better but the fact that these are available for around and last literally forever seems too good to be true nevertheless it is true like many other people we have tried a lot of different can openers some electric some hand held but we always come back to the one that has always been in our kitchen swingawaywhat makes the swingaway can opener superior to other can openers components contribute synergistically to swing aways success very durable tempered steel gears with a cutting edge that stays sharp literally forever ample leverage provided by a large chrome plated steel turn key to assure enough torque into the gears to open any can simply by hand turning plastic coated steel handles that facilitate penetration of the can by the cutting edges with just ordinary hand pressure why are these long lasting super can openers so inexpensive with only several moving parts made of easily manufactured components that are sold on a huge scale worldwide it costs very little to make this product despite its excellence i am not affiliated with any product or company but we have used swingaway literally forever with uniformly excellent result 
top of the line ok admittedly i don t do much of the cooking around the house but my wife makes great soups using this thermal pot now i m not giving this pot a out of rating because of the great soups i m giving it because if you use this cooking pot correctly it will save you time and energy when i first met my wife she owned one of these pots which she bought many years before in hong kong it was also a zojirushi however she got careless one day and left it on the stove while going to bed needless to say she destroyed the pot cant blame the pot for that she claimed that under normal use she would leave it on the stove top boiling for an hour and then put it into the thermal container before going to bed in the morning it would still be boiling or close to boiling and the soup would be great so the pot was destroyed she decided to buy another but could no longer find a zojirushi they don t sell them in canada she decided to buy a shuttle chef crap ! the soup was barely warm in the morning she thought she made an error and didn t boil it long enough next time she tried same thing it couldn t retain the heat well it was just a matter of time before she left that pot on the stove before going to bed and completely destroyed that pot as well oh by the way i have smoke alarms that don t work i found out that night anyway to put this long story to rest i found this zojirushi thermal cooking pot on amazon that almost resembled her original pot i decided to buy it as a christmas present for my wife she was estatic and started to use it immediately this time i always check the stove before going to bed myself anyway we placed the pot in the thermal container overnight and voila ! a steamy hot pot in the morning just like it s suppose to be this pot will work if used properly a lot of people make the mistake of taking the pot off of the stove immediately when the contents boil this is not sufficient time for the bottom plates to store the heat there are layers on the bottom you must leave it on the stove top for an hour while boiling and this will ensure continual heat while inside the thermal container wow i wrote quite a bit anyway here s the summary zojirushi stars if used properly shuttle chef star even if you use it properly boiling on stove for an hour before placing in thermal pot good leaving pot on stove overnight bad 
wonderful plate i love this plate i am actually waitng for the other that i recently ordered my husband loves them becasue they are heavy duty and have a large eating space love the fact that they don t chip and the paint does not wear off everyone that eats over my house comments on my dinnerware all fiesta 
cats are never thirsty the capacity is great we have several cats and one small dog and the dish is never dry we only need to fill it every other day the biggest part is keeping an eye on the tank i wish the flow was a little stronger but that is on another model very happy with the delivery time and all of the packing to make sure it got to me in one piece 
simpe useful cheap what could be better since there s no picture here s a little useful information unlike most of the kitchen thermometers this one is laid out with the display on the side rather than the top more like a fever thermometer for making tea this is a little inconvenient but it ll be nice for grill use since i usually stick the thermometer into burgers from the side also the cap which covers the probe conveniently snaps securely onto the other end of the case to extend the thermometer a few inches so you don t burn your fingers nice touch otherwise it is as advertised and works quite well i m ordering another in fact 
so far so good i just got my flip it yesterday and after a trial run i am very pleased ! i have pergo laminate floors and i have tried everything out there from different mops to steamers and every cleaner under the sun and no matter what i have to wipe them with a towel or they are streaked with water marks even my ceramic tile in the bathrooms needs to be wiped or i get water marks well no more i can tell that it takes some trial and error to use the machine correctly but after testing it yesterday my floors were shining ! no streaks or water marks ! the vacuum part is not the best so i will continue to use my regular vacuum beforehand not a big deal i think since you have to vacuum using a conventional mop anyway but washing the floor was just like vacuuming it to a shine ! finally i don t dread washing the floors ! 
you wont want to get out of bed i wanted a more comfortable bed so i purchased this comforter i ve found i sleep in alot longer than before getting out of bed is difficult if you re looking for a moderately affordable down comforter of high quality this item will suit you just fine i met a girl with a really comfortable bed it made my own bed really unimpressive so i bought this comforter made a huge difference i did notice that the edges of the comforter have more down fill than the center it seemed a little odd but while sleeping its hard to notice i think that is how these are made you can price other comforters and some cost for less than this comforter is a terrific value high quality year warranty recommendable be sure to get a duvet cover my pit bull now sleeps on the floor i used the coupon code hohosave and it covered the shipping and tax 
electric smoking vs charcoal i use various woods when smoking meats or fish in my smokers and when buildingor creating a back yard smoker this is the unit as you can control the heat temperaturefor the woods you use rather than using coal it is the answer to charcoal getting intothe taste over shadowing the flavor the unit is sturdy and well built also good tohave a few for party use taking up little space and doing the job of keeping your items warm or hot depending on the setting the price is also good compared to the competition 
great cooking gear my wife and i first purchased calphalon contemporary nostick cooking gear about a year ago we both love them not only do they cook evenly and quickly but they are easy to handle store additionally clean up is easier then anything we have previously owned we purchased some additinal items through amazon and received them in less than working days we are thoroughly impressed with both calphalon and amazon 
beautiful and exquisite i love this set this is the favorite of all my china teacup sets i have both irish and english bone china and this pattern is exquisite the color is beautiful so delicate i serve formal tea and scones with these teacups i love this set ! 
the cutest and best pillow this is a great gift because there fun cuteand usefull so when you come home from a bad day at school or work there alaways there to me there like a special friend that you can cuddle so for kids and adults this is a must have 
toaster i was in the market for a new toaster to match my new stainless steel kitchen and when i saw this toaster from west bend i fell in love right away it s sleek and the brand name is not large so it doesn t take away from the toaster itself 
too cool for school kitchen not only is this piece cool lookin but the knives it comes with are excellen 
great pet gate easy to install and fits in any door in my house perfect for my chihuahua to go in and out of while the other dogs stay out 
in love with bobo my mini doxie just loves his bobo like others we saw the loofa dog on the petsmart commercials remi loves any plushie that squeaks so we decided to get one he loves it ! i ve had to re sew a few of the seams because he is a vigorous chewer but it is worth every penny 
great product but this one had a defect hi bought the lightwedge as a holiday gift because i love mine but the onei purchased here though it came hermetically sealed in its package had aflaw the toggle button which allows for dimming the light did not work it moved but it didn t dim felt bad because it was a gift otherwise i think it s a really great item that provides light only for the page anddoesn t light up the room or blind your eyes in the darkness 
great for college i bought this set for my daughter who is in college she was doing her kitchen in fat chef according to her my dishes are great ! they re good in both the dishwasher and the microwave all my friends compliment me on how they look and she s real excited about the red having grown up with all the icky ivey that we use at the house in short it s easy to use easy to clean and really tough perfect for college 
great little pan one of the previous customers said this pan did not have the quality of the other calphalon commercial nonstick cookware as far as this user is concerned it absolutely does it is the same qualtiy as other calphalon commercial nonstick cookware yes it is slightly lighter than the larger pans this is called proportionality i have used calphalon commercial nonstick for several years and am totally satisfied with this product line as for this particular qt mini it is a pleasure to use and clean up is a snap i use it for sauces and especially those oil and butter based ones for seafood bottom line is that this is a neat little pan in the tradition of calphalon s commercial nonstick cookware 
good raclette i bought this raclette a couple of months ago it is very easy to clean you can put most parts in the dishwasher the only thing that i overlooked when i bought this item is the fact that you cannot control the heat only on off that does bother me at times other than that it is very good price quality 
deep dish pan with great looks with a fairly intensive effort on my part in the hint department this was a christmas present it is one of those presents that you really actually like the more you use it i like it a lot i ve made five or six lasagnas so far and a few dishes like manicotti all of them were cooked evenly and it behaves like a nonsticktonight i made a nice layer lasagna that brought it up almost to the top with no overflow it is deep from the inside bottom to the top edge compare this to for your standard pyrex qt x dish it cleans easily has a nice color and a nice finish it still looks brand new 
couldn t be happier with global knives i muddled along for years with a collection of mismatched and mostly blunt kitchen knives before i found global knives they are very very good they hold an edge beautifully are well balanced and with the solid handle and blade construction are hygienic and a breeze to clean incredible value being in the medium price range i have a good collection of these now and expect to get many years of service out of them i bought the mina sharpener device too works perfectly 
great product we ve had this product now for about weeks and use it everyday we just put in hardwood floors and needed something that wouldn t damage the floors but picked up the dirt dust and our pets hair this product is extremely light easy to push around my year old loves playing with it and has great suction there s been nothing so far that it hasn t been able to pick up after each use it s simple to open up and dump out the debris it also has a charger unit that conveniently stores the vacuum until next use well worth it 
very satisfied this is a replacement for the same model i had before i ve had the old one for about years and the only problem i had was the cord coming out of the machine loosened up and my husband had to fix it i totally recommend this 
wonderful gadget for the coffee buff warning ! roasting coffee produces smoke ! definitely read up on the process thoroughly before buying the first batch i made with this machine i over roasted due to my ignorance it was darker than a french roast and had little body or flavor and smoked the house up after reading some more i adjusted the program and kept a closer eye on it and roasted an amazing sumatran coffee with far less smoke i am drinking a cup of said batch right now and it is wonderfully clean and delightful one newbie to newbie note coffee roasting is not a set it and forget it kind of process this is more or less like cooking it requires your attention or every smoke alarm in the house will be going off no seriously ! it does have a safety feature so that it will not run longer than min and will shut off if it overheats so fire risk is minuscule even for the most scatter brained of us check out this website for details on the roasting process to get a feel if it is right for you sweet maria s also has an amazing assortment of green beans of very high quality from what i can tell the machine does come with a vent pipe adapter if any smoke in the house bothers you if you have a hood that vents to the outside then smoke is a non issue a full city roast produces about the same amount of smoke as a cigarette obliviously without the nasty cig smell it s kind of funny because the green beans don t smell particularly good nor does the roasting process not bad but not good yet the finished product is so so good ! now that you know it produces smoke this machine works great and produces a very even roast it has a commercial grade motor which is about as loud as a vacuum cleaner certainly not enough to wake the neighbors the programming functionality is great and i look forward to tweaking it for that perfect roast the user interface could definitely be improved and is a bit cumbersome but i did not find it to be very difficult to program at all also the lcd screen is kind of cheap and angled poorly so you basically got to flip it on its side under good light to program it however this is one of only a few programmable machines on the market the only one for this price it roasts around oz which is quite a bit unless you drink two pots a day pauses to take a sip of smashingly good coffee if you are a coffee buff who leans toward the creative side you will probably like this machine i give it stars because wholesale electronic parts are cheap and they could have put better lcd screen on it and angled it so you can read it standing up other than that this thing rocks 
fiesta ware i have used the same fiesta ware for the last years and i have not broken a piece yet ! even when my teenage boys were babies and doing dishes a piece may have slipped out of their hands but nothing was ever broken this shows how durable the fiesta ware really is i would highly recommend fiesta ware to everyone of all ages i own piece settings at the present time and plan on expanding i like the fact that you can collect all different colors and it looks great ! i will be ordering more for when my boys go to college i plan on ordering my mother a piece set for her birthday i love it and i know you would toooo 
good deal i m very happy with this mixer it arrived in pristine condition even though the box it was shipped in looked very tired and worn the machine does what i ask of it with no glitches or complaints i bought it mainly for bread making and after a certain amount of practice i m turning out great products i also have discovered that scoop shaped measuring cups work wonderfully for adding flour and other ingredients so i think i will pass on the idea of purchasing a splatter guard my only gripe is not with the machine but probably with amazon because i did not get the model that was pictured i got the hd i have researched as much as i can and the machine i received is probably identical to the one i thought i was getting but i just don t understand what is so difficult about matching the picture with the product that one is buying seems kind of elementary to me 
it s worth the money it s a handy gadget to have around the kitchen and also for cleaning up the toothpaste blobs in the bathroom sink my only complaint is that the battery life isn t very long and i don t like putting disposable batteries in the trash i fixed that by getting a universal battery charger and some rechargeable nimh batteries problem solved 
gorgeous these are the same exact glassed that i received from waterford they must be getting them from the same manufacturer and placing their names on them but they are still gorgeous heavy and i love them 
business is picking up i have great danes and can t find any of these in suitable sizes locally these are not the toy scoops one can get in pet stores if you have a large dog or many dogs or miniature horses regular horses elephants these are for you 
love it this is just what i was looking for it works beautiful i would buy another if i needed it 
jersey sheets these sheets are great super soft and the best jersey sheets i have owned plus the prices for them are better than other jersey sheets of less quality great and comfy buy 
just the thing for unlighted areas i ve always looked for lights that are useful in areas where reaching electricity is difficult this light is excellent i use it primarily in a garage storage area that has few outlets for electricity and always a spot that needs light however if you forget and leave it on for an extended period it will use up the battery quite quickly best for short lighting projects 
best cat litter this litter is the best it absorbs odors lasts longer than regular brands and my cats love it ! 
the best flavor both of my dogs found carrot to be their favorite flavor over cheese bacon or any of the others yeah carrot is best it was different types of dogs too one pug and one shepheard mix this must taste really good and they must like the mild sweetness he also likes real carrots and pulp from the juicer yeah carrot is that good i go easy on the carrot pulp from the juicer because it is so fibrous 
pleased i usually only buy something if it has good reviews i m pleased with this table that i purchased to put in my entry way it looks very nice there with lamps set on top the only reason that i rated it stars and not is because there are a couple of blemishes on the top i ll be able to hide them with the lamps tho it only took me minutes to put it together 
take the course with it prepare to shell out more for tools i just begin a wilton cake decorating class at michael s and this book comes free with the class which is instructor says these course books should retail about at most you should take the class in addition to read this book the experience of live teaching by an experienced instructor is invaluable during this class you will learn the beginner cake decoration techniques it s a lot of fun and if you don t want to proceed onto course ii or iii it should be fine with just decorating your average cupcake cookies and basic cakes though most people love it so much that they do advance on however i do have to caution that the course i tool kit you can buy michael s is only the bare minimum it does not have all the things you will need for the first class so be prepared to develop this hobby and pay more depending on what you want for other tool tipsbags 
krups filters love the product just need to locate the holder so i can use the filter 
high quality great cleaver top rated by cooks illustrated great balance cuts easily through bones my first practice ended up with some nice marks in my wooden chopping board will last a very very long time save your chefs knife and use this to cut through bones 
great new gaggia super i just purchased the gaggia titanium and boy what a machine ! this thing is idiot proof not to mention it looks great on my counter top ! i was so impressed by the styling that i didn t pay attention to the actual function of the machine at first but when i did i was in awe ! never having used a super auto i was used to an old krups i had purchased at a flea market that actually worked once every other blue moon ! so using the gaggia every morning for my cup of joe made me feel like i was in heaven ! the speed of making a latte in the wee morning hours is unbelievable and the machine s ability to automatically froth my milk for me really makes it a breeze ! i highly recommend this machine to anyone who is looking for an easy to use super automatic machine 
honeywell hac replacement humidifier filter great price even honored later date sale price but lacked outer evaporative cloth covering of original 
same good quality and looks as other calphalon knives this knife has completed the entire calphalon set for me and i am pleased with all of the knives it is sturdy fairly sharp and also looks good i would have liked a little more flexibility in the blade of the boning knife 
i love this pan great grilled sandwiches i received this pan today and i love it it made two fantastic sandwiches in less than minutes the bread was crispy and had nice dark grill marks without being burnt the lid is heavy enough to compress the sandwich without any additional pressing if you have a large family this pan might be a little small i made two large sandwiches approx by inches with focaccia bread and had room for maybe one more sandwich this pan was very simple to clean as well cheese that melted in the interior of the pan easily released after soaking in warm water for minutes the exterior of the pan is enameled as the description states however the interior of the pan appears to be seasoned cast iron not enamel as is reflected in the description this in no way detracts from the functionality of the pan i prefer the cast iron to the enamel properly seasoned cast iron is more non stick than enamel i would highly recommend this pan to anyone that wants to make panini but doesn t want another appliance to sit on the counter 
turboed i am very pleased with the turbo scratcher refill pads ! our cats spend hours entertaining themselves with the turbo scratcher we highly recommend the product and this vendor 
great buy love the table arrived in excellant condition and i put together in hour i have had a lot of experience in assembly of this type of diy furniture though the hardware kit comes with extra piece of key hardware just in case nice touch 
i love these pans i did some research on pans because i wanted some for christmas to replace the old ones i have a inch skillet quart sauce and quart oval pans and they are best pans i ve ever owned what i love about them mine do not have any sticking issues what so ever they clean extremely easy and fast via hand washing no hard scrubbing at all since it only takes seconds to clean i can reuse to cook something else without any flavor from the previous meal the handles do not get hot and they have a good non slip grip i have the silicone rubber handles they apparently can be put in the oven up to degrees but i have not tried that yet they are not as heavy as some professional ones i would recommend buying this brand conif i had to say anything bad about them the only thing i can think of is the rivets that are inside the pan that attach the handle to the pan can get food stuck around them so you really have to clean around that area good i wish they would have just attached the handle to the outside of the pan 
a newer version our old gizmo s battery gave up the ghost we liked the can opener because it was compact under the cabinets and worked well the only problem with the first version was that it was always plugged in a charging which shortened battery life the new version must be removed from the holder to charge overnight this lets you fully discharge the battery before charging which extends battery life much better oh it does a very good job of opening cans 
refurbished eureka ra boss upright vacuum i took a chance on purchasing a refurb and i m glad i did i had read the reviews for this particular vacuum cleaner and decided that i wanted it to replace my old upright shark that died i m extremely pleased with this product it is by far the best cleaning tool i ve ever owned 
order extras i was not so lucky with packaging they were loosely wrapped in bubble wrap by my guess monkeys then they were put inside a large box allowing lots of room for shifting and breakage and finally it seems pounded on by gorillas however only one plate arrived broken which seems a good sign of how well they will hold up under use the dishes are not perfect either there are significant imperfections on a couple of them but the rest are more beautiful than the picture my suggestion would be to buy more than you need and donate the imperfect ones 
good little gadget for the price like another reviewer i was skeptical about this but i wanted a frother to give as a christmas gift and was willing to risk bucks i was pleasantly surprised okay it s not a fancy automatic steamer frother but it does what it claims creates froth out of milk it seems to froth cold milk better than warmed milk but i ve been happy with both i didn t have much trouble putting in the batteries and the stand could seem top heavy but we haven t knocked it over only thing i wish could be improved seems like a lower speed might work a little better the speed of the frothing tip moves the milk so far to the side of the mug that it spills out i ve had better success using a wide mouth latte mug than a regular size cup or pint pitcher 
convient storage the product shipped great only problem was that one lid did not come with a seal on it so it had to be returned the colors are great and the storage is good 
works for me i have cats and they are months now i started them on the citty kitty about months prior and so far its great i was fortunate to have already placed their litter boxes in the bathroom so drawing them from that to the toilet was easy for my cats it seems they follow the litter they also love to on fresh litter especially after i cleaned and replaced it i bought training cats for the toilets i have in my house and they use both of them well once i placed the kits on the toilets and poured fresh litter on it they were ready to use it i am on the last rings and am confident they will have no problems it looks like now they are working their aim into the actual toilet and scraping as much litter in the hole the only thing i suggest is if your cat likes a clean litter ensure you clean the kit daily my male cat got pist one time and pee d in the corner of the bathroom thats the only time any of them made mistakespunching holes can be a mess too suggest getting disposable gloves also sometimes your cat may miss or splatter or what have you i bought a bunch of those cleaning wipes for the bathroom so that before anyone uses the toilet they can wipe off any excess litter or splashes and toss it in the toilet lastly learn your kitty s bathroom routine last thing you need is both of you showing up at the bathroom ready to go 
best christmas present i have been so impressed with this set it all cooks great i think the frying pan would cook best with a gas stove i love the mixing bowls that came with the set it is a very good buy 
very elegant this decanter brings style to the table ! one star deduction for difficult to clean the design is simple but elegant good german quality 
it is very good i have slept on such a pillow for nearly year and i am quite satisfied with it it does provide excellent support although i find it difficult to sleep face down overall it is a very good purchase and is one of the best pillows i have used recommended 
great for cooking serving storing i took a chance on ordering these and i m glad i did they are heavy duty i like the handles as i do a lot of microwave cooking and it s nice to be able to use the handles instead of having to have hotpads each time with the regular white corningware i ve also used these in a convection oven and them seem to work really great ! i picked the sapphire color and they are very attractive on the table as well ! 
this kettle saves me time in the kitchen my husband thinks that small appliances are a waste of counterspace and money i don t always disagree but we make press pot coffee twice a day and heating up the water on the stove took minutes and there was always floating sediment in the bottom of our kettle sounds appetizing ! i researched this kettle and liked the description that the water boiled quickly and turned off automatically i also wanted it to retain heat and be able to be taken off of the heating source for serving my husband and i really like this pot we use it not only for coffee full pot to boiling takes just under minutes but to boil water for pasta and other cooking it saves me time and i don t want to be in the kitchen all night this is one small appliance that we do not want to be without the only change i would make is that the handle seems a bit large for the average hand so it is not as comfortable to hold and i still have sediment which is probably a problem with my water at least now i can get into the pot to clean through the large opening no weird smells here and we have been using daily for months 
bigger than expected what can you say it s a garlic keeper i used to keep garlic on my counter in a small dish this garlic keeper is pretty and covered and keeps garlic out of sight it matches in color with the butter keeper i bought so it works well for me and keeps my counter looking better organized i like that it s bigger than expected i can keep bulbs in it 
these work great their design makes them easy to get in and out and the company that sells them through amazon is prompt and easy to deal with 
this is the heater i ll try and make a long story short my year old son sleeps in a cold part of the house but he refuses to put covers on himself instead he comes to mom and dads room and wakes us up to tell us he s cold well that didn t take me long to figure out we had to do something i bought or different heaters and they all burned out because we run them all night every night this heater is the only one that has kept up for the last two years it s quiet and it works what more do you want don t buy any other heater ! 
it s a good one about the only improvements i can think of would be to make the hose longer for greater reach and to increase the strength of the cord winder that is weak the replacement bags are more expensive because of the convenient design but hopefully the cost will come down when more of them are sold overall it s a good machine good design great suction ! if you buy it you ll be happy 
does what it should no complaints from us we love this crock sometimes the butter slides out but not a product issue or a big deal it has happened with all the ones we ve had this one is a great size for table service 
better than arm hammer pads but these have doubled in price have used puppy pads in place of kitty litter for past several years after having a kitty w cancer even after she died we stuck w the pads for our other two because they re used to it there s no scooping no tracking all we can find locally is arm hammer which over the past few years have declined in quality and gone up in price these are much better and do not leak but unfortunately when i first bought them a couple of months ago they were only per pk of now they re ! no increase in value but a major increase in price what a ripoff unfortunately i can t change my rating i would give it a if this would let me edit the rating 
very nice i ve been through two other brands of cat water fountains and had the pumps give out far too quickly i ve had this fountain for several months and it works beautifully and quietly and has the added benefit of being more attractive than the other brands 
best thing ever one cup of coffee at a time doesn t get better than this perfect for a household of coffee drinkers that wake up at different times 
as advertised we purchased this item mainly as a copper accent for the kitchen but have come to find it quite handy as well as decorative the size was just what we were looking for very nice quality this pairs very well with copper salt and pepper shakers we bought at the same time and they look great on the kitchen workcenter 
great variety easy clean up wondeful machine i have the black fusion in my home office which is next to a basement level theater room and my wife and i already love this machine we have tried all sorts of mixes and we ve only scratched the surface of what this machine can do this is one of the first times i ve been so impressed with a product that i wanted to write a review for it physical properties it handles travel mugs if you remove the drip tray which is largely unneeded anyway and all our standard mugs the drink head moves up and down so it can sit flush against the rim of your mug to cut down on the already rare splashbacks more common with frothy drinks than coffee and tea when it brews a filterpack it blows air through at the end of the cycle to clear it out and thus keep it from dripping as you remove it the water tank could be larger if only because we re so enamored with it that we keep making drinks all day long but if you have a ready source of water nearby it shouldn t be a problem the tank fits better and slides on easier than the senseo which we also have flavorwise it s made by m mmars so you can bet that the sweeter drinks the so called indulgence fare is excellent coffee blends are quite good especially the darker roasts like french roast and sumatra lattes made with espresso roast taste similar to starbucks moreso than other chains cleanup wipe the inside of the drink head and possibly the front of the plastic column the colored portion after any particularly splashy drinks no need to worry about cleaning up the area around the machine especially if you keep the drink head on the rim of your mug of course you can t watch its magic when the drink head is that low so your first few times you ll probably get a drip here and there final bits we ve had the senseo since its launch between pods that need prewetting to avoid blowing past the seal of the portafilter to the not sogreat varieties of drinks the senseo is lagging behind the flavia we drink coffee tea espresso drinks mixed blends and sweet toothfriendly indulgence mixes every day with the flavia and it s brain deadeasy to use certainly easier to clean up after too ! if you re on the fence between the flavia and other single cup offerings like senseo get the flavia keurig and other single cup offerings can t touch the variety of drinks you can make with the flavia i m sipping a lemon blueberry tea blend now made over ice and it s fantastic highly recommended 
great value for an all inone unit received this as a gift at my request over the holidays and have been very happy with it unit is easy to use and produces a quart and a half of nicely consistent ice cream in minutes helps a lot to chill the mix first much prefer it over my old unit that required the bowl to be cooled in the freezer overnight for three reasons doesn t take up the freezer space doesn t require advance planning let s you do multiple batches without waiting one very useful feature is that the mixer operates separately from the compressor so you can turn of the mixer off when it is no longer able to turn but keep cooling the ice cream in the machine for firmer texture as some have noted in reviews on other sites it is somewhat noisy but not unbearably so other than that no real complaints especially considering that this is not a commercial grade unit and only costs i would definitely purchase again some recommendations based on my initial experiences cool the mix first and you ll be able to make the ice cream quickly at the end of a meal for an impressive dinner party treat ice cream will be on the softer side but great when it comes out of the machine so let it set up for an hour in the freezer if you like it firmer a little corn syrup about a tablespoon will create a smoother consistency for some ice creams be careful to fill the bowl only halfway up as the ice cream gains a lot of volume as it freezes even if you are not usually a fan of fruit ice creams try them in this machine fresh strawberry ice cream blows away the store bought stuff the included directions are pretty clear so read and follow them 
nice idea i definitely like the idea of my cats drinking clean water this freshflow works well although it is taking my cats some time to get used to the constant flow ! they don t seem to have much of a preference between this and the regular unfiltered water though i think you would have to replace all water bowls with these for it to fit the purpose 
i love it i love this dish it is slightly bigger than a x it is great for casseroles it is so colorful and washes easily it is a great accent for the table 
i think this coffee pot is awesome i have owned my percolator for about two or three years now i ve never had any trouble with the plastic top breaking off don t know if other people just happened to get defective models or what and have never had trobule getting the lid off ever you just grab the top handle which is made for this purpose again maybe some other people got a bad model the only downside i ve found is that my guests will get to the pot first and pour their coffee with the grounds still in the basket yum crunchy so dump them basket out quickly ! 
great filter but a bit hard to clean i bought this for my boyfriend for christmas and he loves it and uses it several times a day he loves the lid that keeps the water hot while the tea is steeping and it seems to fit in all sizes of our mugs his only complaint was because the bottom of the filter is flat and made of plastic it is harder to clean if it was slanted or had a little bit of filter on the bottom you could run water through the bottom to get some if the tea sludge out instead you have to dig around with your finger scrape it for a bit and rinse it a lot all in all though he loves it and i may be getting myself one too 
uniquely useful little crockpot consider its possibilities this is a lovely little crockpot whose small size makes it uniquely useful for a number of purposes i ve owned larger crockpots for a couple decades currently a quart rival smartcooker is my mainstay for preparing family size meals but the larger pots take up a significant amount of counter space aren t at all useful for heating or re heating small quantities this little crockpot however is perfect for heating or re heating servings of soup or stew i originally bought it however because it is absolutely perfect for making hot cereal on cold mornings especially those hot cereals that require more than a few minutes of cooking in the microwave or on the stovetop such as steel cut oatmeal try the nutty goodness of traditional steel cut oatmeal once also available here at amazon you re unlikely ever to return to instant or quick cook oatmeal again there is nothing nicer on a cold winter morning than walking into the kitchen knowing that a healthy delicious hot breakfast is awaiting you from mid october to late march virtually every night i prepare my entire family s hot breakfast cereal for the next morning in this little crockpot with no more effort than is required to make single serving of instant oatmeal or cream of wheat in the microwave other uses we ve discovered it s perfect for making serving hot mulled cider keeping hot dips gravies warm sauces syrups heated on the buffet as a substitute fondue pot for heating soup at times when hovering over a stovetop or near a microwave would be incovenient how nice to come inside from raking leaves or shoveling snow to a hot bowl of soup for single people or couples who prefer not to cook in large quantities or apartment dwellers with limited storage space this crockpot would be a very acceptable slow cooker especially if used in conjunction with rival s inexpensive sp pdq smart part module also sold on amazon as of the date of this review which provides the same timed cooking controls that are integrated with many of rival s larger more expensive crockpots the energy used is minimal too only watts the stoneware bowl fits easily in the dishwasher as does the lid for very convenient clean up 
no buttery slips this butter dish is great because of the little top knot it s very easy to pick up the lid besides its cute 
awesome this vacuum cleaner is awesome ! not only is it light compared to other vacuum cleaners that i ve bought in the past but it does a fantastic job with a brand new house and a new shoe policy it is still amazing to see what comes up everytime my carpets smell and look great it also does a great job on hardwood floors ! i highly recommend this vacuum cleaner it may seem expensive at first but once you use it for the first time you ll be glad you made the purchase 
steam fast a ez stand for models sp sf and sf stand is sturdy i m satisfied with it 
good product this is a sturdy and attractive product i have very limited space so this totally fit the bill 
i bought sets of these twin sheets great quality i bought sets of these for our family condo that has twin beds they feel rich and think and seem to be well stitched at a set for count is a great deal this quality goes for between elsewhere ive only washed them twice so far so i don t have much more to say good luck and 
absolutely beautiful this wedding cake topper is absolutely beautiful and stands alone as a wonderful keepsake my daughter was so surprised when her father and i presented to her 
melitta ready set joe coffee maker this coffee maker is super ! my office has access to hot water but not enough space for a traditional coffee maker ready set joe was the answer a delicious cup of hot coffee with just the pouring of hot water everything is here and only takes the space of a coffee mug low tech high quality that s how i define it joh 
toasty review for sanyo toasty the sanyo space saver toasty is great on saving space and is a good toaster however it is not the best in using it as an oven to heat up snacks 
nice kids pillow my son loves it very nice it is a nice gift for ages below it got a good shape nice grip to hold 
hours of enjoyment this toy has provided countless hours of enjoyment for our dog we have a lb labrador greyhound mix she eats most toys and is not fond of kongs once the stuffing is out but she is not able to eat the kongs beyond the soft puppy one this toy is great because the hole is small yet there are little prongs you can cut to make the toy less challenging i think she enjoys the noise the treats make inside the balls larger treats of course take her longer to get out but stuffing it with her food works just fine most of the time she realyl enjoys all of the busy buddy products squirel dude is great but the saucer got old quickly for her 
not meant to be shipped packaging packaging packaging this product was meant to be picked up at your local walmart or target carried to your car and tenderly moved to your home although the outer box was wonderfully packed with plastic air balloons the product box designer has no idea on how to keep a product safe during shipping the product arrived and works however both dials had fallen off and had to be searched for in the box the product is cool however this was not meant to be shipped 
beautiful and functional i love this teapot the colors are beautiful they are bright and vibrant it is also a completely funcitonal teapot not just a pretty shelf peice it pours well alot of teapots even well made ones dribble when you pour the tea this tea pot does not dribble which makes it one my favorite teapots 
my bunnies love this this mat is very soft and after hundreds of washes it is still very soft and fluffy enough i don t know about dogs or cats but my bunnies love them it s a perfect carrier liner too i would recommend it 
perfect in every way if you re a coffee lover but the only one in your house this coffee maker is perfect for you i use mine every day it allows you to quickly brew one fresh cup of coffee at a time and the availability of coffee pods in varying strengths and flavors is only improving for the money this is a wise purchase and it will meet your needs as a single coffee drinker in your home 
pet chime doorbell this works great ! however be aware that once your dog learns how to use it they really use ! i think she is taking advantage of it a little bit i would recommend it to anyone with a new pet 
great value so far i have only used these knives once so far so i cannot speak to their durability but i am impressed some people may prefer some forged blades from another name brand henckels premium line but for the price this set includes everything anyone would need to start a collection if you are concerned about the handles being too slick they are meaty enough to fill your hand and i have not had any trouble holding on just be sure to keep them clean honed and sharp and they will melt through even the most stringy chicken breast 
great product this is a great product to use when when need to clean the stairs or a small spill 
love this griddle i absolutely love this griddle pancakes come out perfect i grilled boneless chicken on it it came out very tender and didn t dry out it s so easy to clean definitely worth the money i spent 
best price best delivery i love my presto popper but despaired of finding a good reasonably priced source for the concentrators web searches turned up sellers at per pack but delivery for two packs eight each was bringing the cost of a bowl of popcorn up to more than ! i was so pleased to discover them in a sale at amazon i am stocked up for at least six months now 
comforter is a delight we have the heat in our house turned way down at night and we are toasty warm under our new comforter it s lightweight and a delight 
red fattie very pleased with the new toaster so far wish it wasn t so fat on my counter but it is eye pleasing light weight and fairly quiet the only disappointment for me was that the english muffins for example do not pop up high enough to grab them without having to go in and burning your fingers if you are not careful they had said that this particular model had a higher carriage so this would not happen but it does otherwise great little fat red bug price was excellent with no shipping fees or tax from amazon 
dyson impressive machine overall i ve had a problem with some carpets causing the beater bar to stop resulting in the loud percussive clicking of the beater bar clutch looking around on the internet this seems to be fairly common i understand the clutch is there to prevent issues with the beater bar breaking things but the clutch seems a bit weak on mine the attachments are great for hard floors and furniture i am amazed at what it pulls out of my carpets every time i use the machine but the beater bar is pretty annoying for a machine at this price point even the refurbished one 
super appliance i couldn t be more pleased with this remanufactured product it exceeds my expectations for both quality and ease of use any negative reviews have to be biased by some very isolated situation we have used both the griddle and the panini grill it makes absolutely wonderful burgers chicken sausages and sandwiches the ease it clean up is nothing short of amazing this was a real bargain and i advise anyone who is thinking about it to grab it 
keeps coffee hot sturdy no drip sip top the nissan flip top backpack mug keeps coffee hotter but the hinges are too fragile on the flip tops these keep coffee hot for several hours and the any direction sip top is great for those early morning still dark out drives and these cost only about half the price of the nissan 
didnt use to be a coffe drinker but now my sister purchased this item for my wife for christmas of since she was the coffee drinker in the family in the last year i have gone from not drinking coffe at all to making at least mugs a week oz setting i don t agree with any of the negative reviews this machine has received i have put a cup of coffe brewed with this machine up against various brews from national chain name omitted and prefer the brew from this balck decker times out of they do make a few great lattes consonly thing i can think to mention is that the resivior only holds enough for brews on the oz setting but that is enough for my wife and i to have a full mug each morning prosfast brew great serving sizes easy to fill and clean this is simply some of the best coffee i have tasted 
great product love it i got mine for christmas in older model and i love it i have only used it to make mug so i m not sure how it performs making i liked the mugs that came with it and they fit easily in my car cup holder i have a toyota celica i ve since lost both mugs but it wasn t hard finding replacements that fit under it the coffee is more than hot enough for me i usually have to wait about min for it to cool down enough i am not one to order coffee extra hot at starbucks i usually turn it on in the morning after getting ready but before i am ready to walk out the door by the time i have fed the dog gotten my things together packed lunch etc i can pick up the mug and be ready to go i have no idea how long it actually takes to brew i m always doing other things on average i d say i use it about times a week and it still works great after years of continuous use 
holmes twin fan over all it isn t bad it is fairly quiet i don t have to blast the television or radio when both are on i like the digital temperature display and the feature that will turn the fan either off or on when a certain temperature is reached the only thing that was a negative was i don t feel it is powerful enough to do much good when it comes to the exhaust feature still i feel it was worth the price 
nice with a few flaws a good looking tea kettle and seems to be quite sturdy though i ve only had it a few weeks not heavy but dense enough to make you feel it won t ever burn through the water has to boil like crazy in order for the whistle to get going so you might wait longer than necessary if you re listening for that sound the only real disappointment there s a device connected to the spout that s constructed to seem as if you can flip it and it ll keep the spout open while you pour but you end up having to hold that open with your finger anyway otherwise a fine and aesthetically nifty item 
wonderful design and it works well the design itself is what made me purchase this item i like the fact that it had a wider bottem than others which causes it to look much nicer when the wine poors down the sides i highly reccomend this product for wine enthusiasts and for non wine enthusiasts it s still a nice purchase for you re table i guarantee you will get many comments on it 
it really works i took my knives to chesapeake knife tool to have them sharpened and they destroyed the edge i saw that cooks illustrated recommended chef s choice sharpeners and decided to give it a try it took about an hour but i was able to restore the edge and now my knives are just like new 
this is my second one received the first one as a gift when the handle broke i went looking for an identical skillet my favorite of about different electric skillets i have used cooks evenly and cleans easily 
my favorite appliance using a chemex requires water to be heated in a tea kettle prior to brewing and it requires a finer ground than what auto drip machines ask for after the water is brought to a boil it s important to wait for it to cool just slightly about seconds and then you need to wet the grounds in the filter wait for them to drain and then fill the pot with water want more than a single cup of coffee you wait for your first pour to brew and then fill the filter again some advantages over other forms of coffee brewing taste i don t know how it does it but the filter does keep your coffee from being bitter cleanability users can keep all necessary components clean anyone who s brewed water and vinegar through their coffee maker to kill off a bitter taste that wasn t there when you bought it understands this plight oftentimes the most aggressive criticism of the chemex is its ponderousness to clean because it s not possible to get your hand into the reservoir some people prefer to add hot water and soap and give it a good rinse which is fine if you clean the moment you empty the pot but if you re like me and you let the remaining sip or two sit until a nice coffee stain is on the glass then you need some good ol fashion friction to get it clean the best thing i ve found a baby bottle cleaner it s narrow enough to get into the reservoir and the angle can be adjusted to scrap the walls too brilliant electricity free as long as you can boil water you can have coffee mud sludge french press and stove top espresso style brewing always leaves a thick slime at the bottom of an otherwise rich cup of coffee don t get me wrong i think that s good i use a french press when i m in the mood but the cone on a chemex doesn t allow that at all style size the chemex coffee pot is a relic designed in the s and the wood cuff with rawhide tie screams simplicity and elegance and it s a wonderful minimalist sight on any kitchen counter and unlike electric coffee makers easy to move if you need the space some drawbacks any purchaser should consider time it does take minutes of labor to get the morning cup of coffee cones you can t run over to wal mart when you use the last filter you need to find a specialty store or go online which means you need to plan ahead cold coffee no electric hot plate thank god means coffee not poured and consumed immediately gets cold quickly you can buy a wire guard and a glass lid so your chemex can be warmed on the stovetop i think that s more labor added to an already laborious endeavor just have a warmed thermos ready and use that to store any unused coffee learning curve it does take some time to get the grind right the amount right and the water level right to find a cup which caters to your tongue cleanability i know this is in the advantages column as well but it s worth mentioning that a lot of people hate cleaning these things to submerge it does mean pulling off the wood cuff which is a small pain else it will get nasty over time 
nice compact unit if you re looking for an ultrasonic cleaner for general purpose usage then this is your unit i ve used it to clean a variety of objects and it definitely does the job it has been trouble free the size of the unit is compact enough for easy storage or travel in short this cleaner performs as advertised 
presto it s done love my pressure cooker had another presto for years bought an electric one last year promptly threw it in the garbage when this one arrived ! can t beat them 
no soggy cookies i got this cookie jar for christmas it was the style i have been looking for i was aware of the review about soggy cookies however i have not had that problem perhaps it has to do with location i live in the pacific northwest the size of the jar is great as well i can actually fit all the cookies that are produced into the jar previous jars have not been able to hold as much 
so nice to have sharp knives again i had been using my victorinox steak knives for all my cutting needs because i can t be bothered to get out my huge cooking knives and have to clean them afterward yes i am that lazy i finally decided to get some knives for paring etc that i can throw in the dishwasher the first time i used the paring knife in this set i actually cut my thumb because they are so much sharper than what i had been using yes i have that horrible habit of cutting towards my thumb and not away anyway i was pretty impressed this is a good brand and this is a nice little set 
excellent duvet for little money the price of this item is excellent for the quality you get it is extra soft and the blue color was exactly what i was looking for it did give off quite alot of lint when i washed it but that did not affect the quality of the item the duvet also did not shrink and i have washed it several times so far if you are looking for something to keep you warm and cozy i highly recommend this item for the price it cannot be beat 
beautiful shape easy to use i have about different pans and this is by far my favorite for a few reasons kids love the shape is it a crown is it a forest the shape makes it very easy to cut uniform size pieces the pan releases very easily recommended 
good job drinkwell i have two cats and i definteley spoil them rotten ! when i first decided to get a water fontain for my cats i chose the petmate freshflow over the drinkwell because the drinkwell was more expensive and i was completely against the idea of listening to running water all day unlike most customers i ve heard from the petmate worked farily well as a water bowl it was easy to clean and my pump never stopped working as i ve read many others did however the water running down the little ramp really didn t satisfy my cats they did drink from it but they would still jump at any chance to drink running water out of a faucet which is the whole reason i started thinking about getting them one in the first place about a ear and a half later i started thinking about getting them a new one and possibly going with the more expensive drinkwell this time i saw the new drinkwell platinum and decided to go with it right away the platinum is more expensive than both the previous models i was looking at but it is definteley worth the extra cost it s like drinkwell took all the criticism and praise for both thier design and their competitors and created an exceptional pet drinking fontain i have had my platinum for about months now and have been very pleased with it the drinkwell team designed the water outlet so that it would minimize the water from braiding which cuts down on the water noise in fact at the setting i have mine about mid way between low and mid level i can t hear it at all ! they also put a little debris trap before the water even gets to the pump which should greatly increase the pumps life the water resevoir is also much bigger than that of my petmate and the drinkwell s optional larger resevoir on their original design all and all i veiw this as a time where a company actually went out there and designed their product by what thier customers wanted so after reading all that you maybe wondering why i only gave this product stars well the one thing that i would really like to see is that the actual bowl area be made of stainless steel or some ceramic mix which is totally what i have been told by several vets is the best material for any pet to be drinking eating out of if they were to add that one extra feature than i would give this stars out of hands down 
the smell of morning coffee this is close to the same coffee maker my dad s girlfriend uses sometimes i get confused when i m in the back room on the computer and i hear the coffee maker turn on by itself thanks to a timer i think it s strange how your coffee will make itself while you re still asleep when i hear it start up and see no one in the kitchen i think ok a ghost must be around me right now it s like we re living like the jetsons or the exorcist according to everyone who uses black decker this is a good coffee maker and the white color matches everything else in the kitchen the only thing i don t know is if it s safe to get water under the coffee maker since it s located next to the sink and no matter how hard you try water will squirt over there of course i don t deliberately splash water under it to see if a fire starts but i always make sure it s dry under there i can only imagine it s developed for the best safety 
no choice have used corelle dishes for over years it is easy to wash stack and dry corelle nests in relatively little space in your cupboards my entire family uses corelle for everyday living the designs are beautiful and numerous the urban black design compliments your black white kitchen appliances 
love the look love the toast the english take their toast seriously and while i don t share their affinity for beans on toast for breakfast i lusted after this gorgeous piece of appliance art at williams sonoma for years about seven years ago when the dollar was still strong versus the british pound i bought the combi model by mail from a restaurant supplier in the uk for about less than the then going us price while it s a bit dicey fitting thick cut bagels into the slots not a big bread item in the uk i solve the problem by using the sandwich baskets to contain them the toasting is even and i actually the enjoy the old fashioned timer without pop up which keeps the toast warm while the rest of breakfast is being assembled unlike others i do not unplug it after each use never had a problem the crumb tray is terrific and actually does catch every bit of crumb without a mess i ve had the krups and cuisinart models which burned out within two years this one is made for restaurant use and i expect it to last a lifetime worth every penny if you appreciate high end kitchen appliances and tools 
cats will play all the cats that i have everbeen owned by yes you read thatcorrectly have loved this toy therefore we all recommend it 
the perfect scoop i ordered this machine in anticipation of david lebovitz new book of ice cream recipes coming out any day now the perfect scoop he used it to test all his recipes i have looked at machines with built in chiller compressors in the past but they have always been out of the price range that i wanted to spend for a not so often used kitchen gadget the amazon price for the remanufactured unit solved that the best thing is that you can now make several flavors back to back and not need to wait a day to refreeze the chiller insert that has been taking up too much space in your freezer this model is far superior and not that much more money granted it is loud and takes up a lot of counter space but david s recipes are getting rave reviews i am using it all the time now and ordered a second machine already to lend to friends and family how is that for a stellar endorsement ! 
great quality and unbelievable price this deal is amazing the quality is an eight out of with a desgin that brings out an appealing look to the throw cover ten dollars for such high quality is hard to pass by 
dissappointed i cannot purchase hi i am really sad that i cannot purchase this product as i live in australia i think it is out of this worldcheersann 
excellent showerhead ! great for people with lousy water pressure i recently moved to an older rental it even has an old fashioned fuse box the water pressure here is horrible i thought i d have to join a health club to get a decent shower but this little showerhead is somehow able to turn the weak water pressure into a wonderful skin smacking shower ! i mean the water really blasts i also took out the water saver device but that did not help when i did that with other showerheads as for the filtration it is excellent i have been using this product with good results but only recently with their showerhead i used to have red and itchy skin on my back and stomach but not since i started using this product 
mix nmeasure the item is of good quality and a good addition to any bar or kitchen 
great espresso poor steaming wand for the price i d give the espresso making part of this machine stars the portafilter and brew group are substantial and well made i ve worked at two espresso shops with commercial machines and the parts on this moderately priced gaggia are nearly as heavy and substantial as the big multiple thousands of dollars machines i ve had the machine for days and have been brewing shots with starbuck pods the toggle switches are easy to use the reservoir is easy to fill and the shots are aromatic and full of crema every time however the steaming wand takes a star away from this machine it does not rotate in every direction like the comparably priced starbucks machine this makes it hard to remove a cup full of frothed milk from under the wand without spilling also the plastic frother contraption is silly actual frothing capability is pretty good though the plain metal tips on the commercial machines produced finer microfroth and were more fine tuned to the trained barista s hand overall it s a good looking machine and i m satisfied with it for my main purposes iced lattes and americanos and straight double shots all of which do not require use of the steaming attachment this is a good entry level machine that will brew you good shots and look good on your countertop however i m expecting to outgrow it and move up to an isomac with more refined steaming capability within a few years 
nice coffee maker this maker pours well and has a soft handle we actually found one at a department store so we were able to see it in person before ordering it online nice little coffee make 
can t do without one i got a mogu person pillow a few years back for christmas and have slept with it everyday since my original one was getting flat from all the wear so i bought another here at amazon i just love the pillow ! amazon got it to me in no time flat i must warn you that these pillows not only fun but addicting you won t be able to do without one either 
lovely platter i ordered this as a christmas present for my brother he s always been looking for a big platter that would fit in his cupboard this platter is not only big and deep to hold a big turkey and the juices its also rectangular it fits square in the cupboard ! in short my brother loved it 
read the instructions first you ll love it this toaster does everything we ve had it at least years if the toast comes up and you can t reach it push up on the handle and it s easy to grab if you only like bagels toasted on one side you can put the halves in push the quotbagelquot button and voila ! your bagels are toasted on one side be sure the cut sides are facing out the bread is frozen keep it on the toasting temp you like and push the quotfrozenquot button the toaster gives you your toast just the way you want easy to clean should be advertised better great bet 
wonderful beautiful and durable cookware this set is really nice it warms up super fast and retains heat longer due to the cast iron it looks wonderful hanging in my kitchen too the pots have been used heavily and still no chips cleans up super easy with soap and water i have never tried the dishwasher it is a heavy set but the bestest of quality 
metal table fan fantastic great fan ! great color ! easy to clean a great price ! quick delivery ! what else could you ask for 
happy with it works looks good fits in the fridge well enough im happy with it 
really works wish i had bought it sooner i bought this item when i had to replace my microwave and i was hoping to reduce microwave smell that funky tomato sauce smell that blows out from microwaves after too many spatters you can clean out a microwave but you can t clean behind the vent grids and that is where splatters go and live forever in pungent biomass so i figured the food would blow out the vent hole of the cover and splat the roof of my oven but reduce the problem we use the oven mostly for reheating and melting this cover exceeded my expectations it fits my tiny sharp r kk watt oven a bit of an overhang but it has never fallen off the platter no discernable splatters even on the roof of my oven which i wipe out every day ! the steam vent not a finger hole on top releases the pressure at the top where steam rises even pyrex casseroles with glass lids are not as good because pressure builds the lid lifts from the steam and they shoot hot liquid in all directions food cooks better we used to use paper towel or another dish to cover the food here food cooks in a moist environment and doesn t explode as much because of the steam regulation from the clever top vent paper towel would always slide off or sink into the food and cook into the food and let food blast out the edges the cover doesn t get very dirty i guess because food explodes less it is easy to clean by dunking in my dishpan and rinsing nothing has baked onto this lid the food keeps better if it is done cooking i can leave the food in the microwave because the lid keeps it from drying out it works great on taller containers that still fit under the circle i have rubbermaid microwave containers that are about inchers tall and x inches at the base i can set this lid on top of the container the vent hole keeps the contents from blowing and protects the oven the hole on top is not a finger hole use pot holders to remove anything from a microwave be defensive it only takes one mishap to land a surprise burn never assume a spot is safe to touch i note the comments about breakage i wonder if that is from dishwasher heat i find rigid plastic dishes cannot take the hot water treatment without becoming brittle and often become opaque and crack so i am hand washing which is easy because it hardly gets dirty dunk swipe rinse i saw the cheap chinese imitations i will stick with american made plastics for food prep and save a job too nordic ware is a great innovative companyand hey if your food is piled higher than the cover you need something else 
amazingly spill proof what a great idea for anyone with kids or a clumsy adult in the house ! these tablecloths look and feel beautiful but their main selling point is their stain resistant design if a liquid is spilled on them it just beads up you have to chase the beads with your towel but they don t soak in it also washes amazingly well i bought the ivory one for my mother with her grandchildren think chocolate donut and marker stains and it still looks brand new ! needless to say we have since bought many other colors for both of us i cannot recommend these strongly enough and the price is great 
very nice pasta set i bought this as a christmas present for a dear friend of mine who recently began collecting rooster objects the entire set arrived in perfect condition the colors red black are vibrant and striking the rooster pattern is on each piece and is very nice very good quality good size and good price will make a perfect holiday gift for serving pasta or stew or salad or whatever 
scoop free lt fresh step refill litter cartridge pack excellent just as described and arrived prompt great job thanks annmarie 
works great on pet hair i needed a hand held vac for my travel trailer particularly since we decided to take the german shepherd with us on vacation this year the ability to pick up pet hair was a must i read on a lot of reviews and narrowed it down to the dirt devil and a cordless shark forget the model now i bought the dirt devil in a local store because i didn t want the hassle of returning it in case i didn t like it but i love it ! i haven t used it in the travel trailer yet but i ve been using it weekly to vacuum the pet hair from the dog s bed the cat s bed and the chair the dog uses it works so well i was amazed at how powerful it really is it works even better at picking up pet hair than my upright does using the attachments pluses include a nice long cord and a powerful motor with the brush the minuses are it s a bit noisy scares the cat and kind of heavy someone with an arthitic hand might have problems using this vac also it seems to get pretty warm but i only use it for a few minutes at a time so it s not been a problem i wish it came with a bag for the attachments i recommend cleaning the dust cup every time you use it mine fills up fast i don t use the little trap door but instead twist off the cap and empty it that way also i highly recommend cleaning the filter after every use it really becomes clogged with dust even after only one use i take it outside and tap it against something to knock out the dust after about uses now i m going to vacuum it with the attachments from my upright i think cleaning the filter after every use will help prolong the life the filter and even the vacuum itself i highly recommend this vacuum for anyone with quick jobs or with the need to vacuum up pet hair i m glad i decided on this model instead of the cordless shark now i don t ever have to worry if it s charged 
nice looking but not rugged a nice looking product great for cutting soft foods like bananas but for serious kitchen use this board falls short it s prone to slipping down under heavier use 
great value for the money this knife set is a good value for the money need to keep the slicer and butchers knives sharp through proper maintenance but that is true of all good knives utility knife is wasted and i really wish the scissors came apart for easy cleaning as i use them to cut whole chickens often otherwise chef s knive and slicer feel very good in the hands steak knives still sharp after months of use and overall the quality of manufacture is excelent 
finest piece of cookware i own i ve always liked the calphalon products but i lost my whole set a few years ago when i found this piece on sale at such a reasonable price i snapped it up i ve never enjoyed cooking so much in my life the copper heats the pot evenly and quickly it s a dream to keep clean the lid fits perfectly the only thing i don t like about this piece is that the weight distribution on the handle is awkward i have rmi which weakens my wrists and makes lifting and pouring off liquid difficult a more ergonomic design to the handle would have been better however the ease of cleanup the perfect heat conduction and the outright beauty of the piece make up for any awkwardness i love it so much i m asking for the rest of the set for christmas 
excellant water filter system now i can drink water and make tea coffee without the clorine tast 
removed smoke from bedroom the people next door and above me in my apartment building smoke i tried everything from lighting inscence buying filter products they worked a little while but i had to keep changing the filters expensive i decided to buy something to blow the smoke outdoors i was ready to move thank god for this fan it blows smoke and all other oders outside the minute i turn it off the smoke instantly returns this is a great product 
sportsman s grill durable hunk of cast iron after building a custom cart for the lodge the propane grill now takes a back seat the grilling grate can be improved by adding a lip around the perimeter to prevent fall offs also a two position height adjustment would aid in temperature control

nice but heavy i received this cookie sheet today i haven t used it yet but thought i d leave a review anyway it is very nice and even has cookie targets on the cookie sheet to get uniformed shaped cookies i like it for myself but it is large and rather heavy if you have difficulty lifting something heavy you might go for a smaller or lighter cookie sheet 
great value when you consider the great convenience of the cuisinart ttg rm mug to go coffeemaker and the low price that amazon is asking this deal is too good to pass up enjoy a hot tasty brew and save cash while you re at it 
awesome for dorms tea drinkers this kettle is amazing it s simple you plug it in and flip the switch a light turns on to let you know it s working it heats very quickly lt minutes for a full kettle of boiling water and if you only want a cup or two for tea it heats in about for students in dorms you can use it for oatmeal soup tea automatically cuts off after boiling for a minute so no worries about fire hazards great product i use it every day 
if you have an army to feed this is the one this pot is huge you could probobly cook lobsters or have an awsome clam bake with it it s beautiful heavy and unbelievably priced 
beautiful elegant placesettings this dinnerware looks rich and elegant you can feel the quality in each piece when you hold it in your hands i got white and i couldn t be happier the enamel is bright and glossy and there are no imperfections whatsoever my clumsy self whacked a plate against the faucet and dropped a mug in the sink but not a chip these dishes make your meals look very appetizing and are perfect for casual or formal meals i am excited about buying more waechterbach pieces maybe in different colors for some pop 
perfect for a duvet let s get this clear it does not sound like a newspaper when moving around and it does keep you warm and comfy ! we bought this to fit inside a duvet set also purchased on amazon check my review on that another good buy could not be more satisfied it is very fluffy full and exceeded all expectations in every way dont let the price fool you you get more for your money with this deal get it ! 
outstanding we received this as a gift from our wedding registry easy to season it comes with clear instructions for seasoning and cleaning it also came with a slim cookbook quite helpful since we d never used a wok now we can t get enough of using it ! great quality for a very low price 
great value for money i own many all clad pans but still found this pan an excellentvalue for money the build quality is excellent another reviewermentioned that he received a worn out pan that must have beena mistake the one i received is brand new and the cookingefficiency is better than much more expensive all clad stainlesssteel pans also the pan is not very heavy so handling is notdifficult also it works on all cooktops including induction thispan does not come with a lid so you may have to order the lidseparately overall i am very impressed with this item 
i like it but a pain to keep clean i really like popcorn and i really like this popper perfrect popcorn everytime and very very few unpopped kernels the butter drip on the top is a nice idea but it doesn t work very well i can t taste the butter when i use this method so i don t the only downside and i think this would probably be true of any oil based popper is that it is a pain to clean you have to put the cover and the stirring mechanism in the dish washer to get it truly clean and if you have a dishwasher with a heating element in the bottom that is going to warp the cover unless you can somehow fit this large item on the top shelf 
good price i priced the exact same item at our local big box pet store and saved about ordering online including shipping 
does the job for the size i just received my oven today one day after ordering and used it to cook a dish for dinner it did a fine job and was surprised to find it so quiet often these types of convection ovens can be noisy not so in this case it also is a rather nice look machine and the company that sent me the oven was excellent the reasons for not giving it stars are that the inside is not as big as i would have liked but it still is a fairly decent size i also think that the control panel is a pain to set up not difficult but i guess i am just used to using dials overall a good oven and the company that sent was also excellent to deal with 
cute comfortable and lovable i received my mogu about months ago and i ve gone to sleep holding it ever since they really are nice to hold would reccomend 
great little machine compact quiet great suction and suction control options simple to use the telescopic wand is great as are the degree turning wheels the two different temporary housing slots for the wand make stopping and starting during the vacuuming session easy the design of the miele in terms of maintenance is simple and effective the only cons i can see are that the tool storage on the wand sometimes gets in the way when you want to vacuum under furniture you need to take it off also the on off switch is not always very responsive 
excellent towels for the price these towels are an excellent bargain they are just the right size for wrapping my hair in and still big enough to dry off with 
works great i put this on our wedding registry years ago and was delighted when we received it as a gift it has worked perfectly from day one ! easy to clean if cleaned right away and feels very sturdy our only problem is that the litle cleaning brush it comes with found it s way into our garbage disposal and was pretty chewed up it s going to be difficult to replace this small part 
picture does not show the beauty of these pieces i bought this dinnerware set and just love it i have since either bought matching pieces on my own or have friends wonderful enough to add to my collection i am planning to get another service for and to extra dinnerplates as i never seem to have enough have had the matching containers on my wishlist for some time may soon break down and buy them for myself as a present from my birds for mothers day along with the salt and pepper shakers my work allows me to be able to get to many different stores i am therefore able to comparison shop that has proved futile i have yet to find a better price on anything i have bought or wanted that is less then amazon the piece dinnerware set is usually higher so i am getting these from here better price take my word 
great color this food coloring was the best i have ever used it is very concentrated i obtained several different shades of purple by adding just a tiny bit each time i did not notice a flavor at all so i look forward to trying the black the bottle sizes are very similar to a bottle of finger nail polish 
cute cuisinart this little cuisinart hardly takes up any room on the counter it is very powerful and you must be careful so you don t turn your chopped veggies into puree 
great fun if you like fondue youll like raclette as much or even more use your imagination dont stick with what is traditional you can use your raclette for desert pizza breakfast and much more ! traditionally served with steamed red potatoes this will satisfy the meat and potatoe man in the group marinade the meat with different flavors to add some spice don t forget the vegetables slice onion red peppers mushrooms romas and even pineapple it s a great way to spend an evening with a couple of friends extra trays are a good idea if you use your raclette a lot 
georgetown end tables i purchased two of these last saturday i love them the first table only took min and the second minutes would have given a star review however there was an excessive amount of grease on the screws and hardware included to put it together although sealed excellently it was hard to put it together without getting grease on the table br br 
best coffee love it ! bought several for friends definitely buy the beans and a grinder a huge difference between this and drip 
the best part of waking up is italy in your cup this coffee maker is exactly like the one our hostess used in a b b in rome it is easy to use and it takes us to back to italy every morning coffee needs to be gound fine this is an espresso maker so if your looking for an american type of coffee look elsewhere we love this though it looks awesome is easy to use and makes incredible espresso this is the brand sold all over italy 
moroccan cooking i am very pleased overall w this product my husband is moroccan and we cook tagines probably times a week we had been previously using a very small clay tagine from morocco and needed a larger size we have cooked a wide array of foods in this tagine and are very happy w all the results not to mention it also looks wonderful displayed on our range top when not in use the heat is evenly distributed and the steam is circulated well in the conical lid the one thing i would do to enhance this product is to create a small hole for venting for now we prop it open on occasion w a wooden spoon we have requested the smaller tagine for a gift 
french press coffee maker after a period of eighteen months of burning out three different bands of automatic coffee makers mr coffee etc and each having spouts that seemed to have minds of their own i decided to try something that has no automatic features and nothing to burn out after several months i love it it brews great coffee especiallyif you have a grinder that can grind coarse the only thing i miss is the clock on the other type makers 
great product i have bought one for every bed in the house the teenage boys grandma and husband love these memory foam mattress toppers i only wished i had them years ago what a great price ! thank yo 
my poochies ought to be bald we love the furminator i have a jack russell terrier and a rat terrier both have that short wiry hair that sticks to everything and they make little hair cobwebs throughout our home as well brushing wasn t working frequent washing wasn t working it was too expensive to buy this furminator treatment and have both dogs groomed too i was at my wit s end i purchased the small blue furminator tool with inch blade along with the furminator shampoo and furminator solution i washed both dogs with the shampoo for minutes each as directed the shampoo smells like pina coladas which made the rat terrier lick this is bad as soap does upset dog tummies but a ton of hair came off of both dogs after the shampoo about a fist full each next i slathered them up with the solution which smells like roses or some other floral scent and left that on for minutes again another fistfull of hair came out with the rinse ! i allowed both dogs a couple of hours to dry all the way then came back and used this tool the rat terrier wouldn t go for it he hates all brushes but the jack russell terrier loves being brushed and let me go over her whole body except the sensitive areas with the tool and let me tell you i got a wad of superfine undercoat fur the size of her head off of that dog and the only hair she s leaving around the house is hair that was already all over the place prior to the furminator treatment i don t get hair flying off her when petting her anymore and even the rat terrier that wouldn t let me use the tool on him is still not putting out a lot of shedding i would highly recommend the furminator products they are expensive and somewhat time consuming to use but they work as advertised 
great wine is just a button away this wine opener is the greatest thing invented i love it almost more than i love the wine try it you won t be dissapointed it is so easy to use 
everything they say these are great the color and the cost my family thinks they make the room look so modern they don t look cheap but they are light enough for me female to move with one hand i slide them under the dining room table instead of using chairs this is a great space saver if you live in a smaller apt or house 
good buy bought this for my automatic cat box seems to work well with it i do think the odor control could be better i recommend using a sprinkle on odor control overall it cleans up way better than traditional litter and without the dust 
super practico el dise o es genial el material tambien el chupon se ajusta muy bien lo coloque dentro del fregadero desde hace una semana y ni se a movido 
stars out of the other reviewers have said it all but here s my take on this very affordable i got mine from a local well known chain store for less than a coms affiliate offers it for to replace an old entry level swing away that had seen better days this unit is designed with the usual top gear wheel turned by the handle but has incorporated a second gear wheel for the can underlid rim advance wheel that meshes with the top gear wheel making for truly effortless can opening my rival xtra tall electric can opener was jamming on the large oz solid lid coffee cans but this swing away had no trouble with these cans opening them with great ease buy this one and let the others including the side openers a fad that i feel will fade quickly gather dust on the shelves swing awayin this configuration is the best ! 
excellent dishware you just can t go wrong with fiestaware it s sturdy durable attractive cleans up easily from table to dishwasher to cabinet and if my rough ondishes family can t break it no one can 
wonderful and reasonable i was sick of all of my mismatched flatware some dating back to the s so i browsed the reviews and saw that this set was well liked i am very pleased with it ! the pieces have a nice weighty feel to them and i really like the pattern it looks like a much more expensive set they washed up in the dishwasher beautifully too i liked this set so much i ordered a second one great flatware at a very reasonable price 
great can opener great can opener but doesn t have the knife sharpening feature other openers in the same price range have 
the best book light ever i got two black and silver one for my daughter and one for myself we both like them it is very bright both pages completely covered ! easy on eyes and as a bonus batteries last a long time turns on fast clips on a book very easy and secure a bit bulky to carry around but quality of the light worth it very well made 
overall a good set fortunately ours didn t break during shipment i am not too crazy about this pattern but still bought this set just b c it was the best one available in my price range they are quite heavy a bit too heavy for everyday use and will last a long time i really like the large bowl and especially the design of the lids ! the lids are so light and easy to grab place and remove the flat design makes it easy to store in your fridge which to me is a big plus over those bulky traditional corningware glass lids 
rubbermaid gets the job done we learned about this spatula from several very good professional reviewers they were absolutely right about it s easy of use firm handle feel and easy release i highly recommend this item 
attractive set these were great for the money i had similar items break after awhile and i order these exact replica to match the set i had surprising great quality and have held up the st month so far 
taylor key timer the timer is easy to use and a very convenient size to carry around in a pocket i can hear it ring from another room if necessary i wish the ringer or buzzer would go off a second time after a brief interval i have yet to figure out how to replace the battery if it ever dies 
loved the flute glasses i am so pleased at the waterford glasses i ordered for my daughter i was worried about the shipping but they were packed in layers and arrived in one beautiful piece 
definitely worth it i love this blender we use it at least times a week to make strawberry smoothies i ve never had a problem with it and its a cinch to clean great product 
cute i recommend this banner i didn t like the larinat but it was easy to change thanks recomiendo ampliamente este banner no me gust el lazo pero fue facil de cambiar gracias ! 
dvd cd storage beautiful wood tone would blend with any dark furniture can be stacked on top of each other or side by side looks really nice i am a short woman therefore stacking would not work picture does not do justice to produce am extremely satisfied and shipment was unbelievably fast 
all you need this filter is a wonderful part filter you get the mechanical biological and chemical filtering all in one easy to use easy to maintain filter it does take about clearance from back of tank to wall so measure ! i like the big sponge and the idea that the water has to start at the bottom and then go up through all the media before going into the tank also for leveling you can use a piece of inch tubing between the body of the filter and the aquarium to make it level i found that this works very well and stays in place just a helpful hint ! lol when i get the courage to move my g tank away from the wall a little more i am going to get another 
great i can t beleive anyone would just use this for serving it s a very useful size great for searing meats and then roasting in the oven rice dishes etc the pan is not heavy the lid is a killer but i think that helps in braising 
great for cleaning grout i bought this steamer primarily for cleaning grout and it worked it took a little bit of scrubbing along with the steam but the grout looks like new however my grout was only two years old so it may or may not work as well with older grout overall i think this machine is a great value for the price 
mr coffee this is the perfect size coffee maker for an apartment or camper i have one in both 
funny gift to give it s soft and medium sized didn t pay too much for them so didn t feel too bad when friends would come over and ask if they could take one now i don t have any left but they re an interseting little soft stuffed animal kind of thing no real practical purpose probably and i heard it s a horror if it ever opens spills its contents and it s kind of funny the thing itself is soft but it comes in a huge box with tons of air pillows when you order it from amazon at least so if you re moving and need packing material then here s a for special 
great table i have had this console table for about years it was very easy to assemble i just added a little wood glue while assembling the screws in it is very sturdy if you follow the instructions and add a little wood glue inexpensive at any hardware store i preferred adding the wood glue because i did want it be sturdy it is a very nice neutral color that matches anything so far in the years i have had it nothing has gone wrong it still is very nice 
amazon was the answer to my christmas gift giving problems i was looking for a tea kettle for my sister for christmas and couldn t find one anywhere finally i tried amazon and came up with a new problem which one to choose amazon had a wide variety of items to choose from their prices were excellent and with their super saver shipping i saved a lot of money shopping online versus a store the kettle came very fast and was everything i wanted it to be it s not some cheap flimsy tea kettle but the real deal my sister loved it i would definitely recomment using amazon for anything you re looking for the prices are great and you can t beat the convenience 
durable but perhaps too heavy as the description describes this salt and pepper shaker set is stable and durable especially in the dishwasher however if one fills each shaker to capacity they become quite heavy perhaps too heavy to be passed comfortably at dinner the shakers are not demarcated and the head design is such that they would look substantially similar one shaker has four holes and the other has three thus it become confusing as to which condiment is in which container still though i will take durability over the other drawbacks 
great buy works fine for most applications only issue i have so far months is that the whisk doesn t fit the bowl shape well enough to whip small amounts of cream or egg yolks the latter is more of a problem as i want to use the unit to make mayonnaise and similar sauces 
these are the best knives after showing serious interest in pursuing a career in the culinary hotel field my dad bought me my first henckel knife as part of a set in i dropped out after months but i still had my knives and i promised my dad i would make good use of them considering how much he had paid for them i have been a loyal fan ever since just last week the handle gave out on me and i have returned to purchase a new one i got a lot of use out of it and i was impressed with how long it lasted considering the abuse i put it through nineteen years of service was worth every penny 
light duty but gets the job done i bought this stockpot because i d started making my own soup at home i was hoping to get a pot that was a little more heavy duty because this one is a bit thin however i used it anyway and in true farberware form this pot came through for me so aside from being lightweight this one does its job plus a great price too 
apron accessories galore this collection from cooknstyle is superb i bought several aprons oven mitts and pot holders for my wife for christmas as a woman who loves to cook and who loves to really get into the act of cooking she has owned many aprons in the past she has been quite impressed with the quality of workmanship from everything she received our only minor complaint was that not all lines carry all accessories for example one apron only had the matching mitts and not the pot holders also but for the most part cooknstyle has a wonderful collection in addition to a very nice collection they also provide free shipping over and i was very impressed with their service i ordered late in the day on the th of december and had them in my hands on the th great service great products great price you can t go wrong 
mugs any color several resturants in our area use these mugs because of their strength and certainly their varied colors that make any table setting look good i personally love the handle design it fits my hand and i just love the unique design of it 
success on an australian shepherd we have an aussie healer mix we think she was a foundling with a thick soft coat i ve had her professionally groomed once a year for about years at to a pop so last summer i decided to try it myself with this clipper kit to make a long story short she didn t turn out so bad ! well the neighbors didn t laugh anyway it took me a while to get the hang of it i finally chucked the various combs and went with the bare clippers but she didn t complain and i had a cool dog for much less than a pro cut the best part was i could keep her trimmed all summer as her heavy coat grew back no report as yet how long the blades last but i m already money ahead even if i must replace them next year 
better than expected performance with this table cloth at the last minute before thanksgiving my mom decided she had to have a brand new table cloth she ordered two from one of those junk mail catalog that arrive monthly those cloths came in and were the wrong sizes she returned those cloths and i went online to hunt down a replacement i stumbled upon the reflections inch round tablecloth we had a tough time choosing a color ! we settled on the stone blue we placed the order but when it came down to selecting shipping we didn t want to pay for overnight service we know it would not be here if we did regular shipping but we took our chances here s what happened i placed the order late and the table cloth should have been processed the next day for some reason it was processed that same day amazon got this cloth to us within days not the to days they told us it would take amazon did an outstanding thing by getting this item out and shipped to us so it was in our hands so we didn t have to worry about what we were going to do about a tablecloth thanksgiving day were put this beautiful blue table cloth on our table for thankgiving dinner mom was to happy that we found suck a nice cloth that did not cost an arm and a leg she was very happy she didn t have to spend a ton of money getting it here our thanksgiving dinner was terrific nothing stained or damaged this cloth ! it is easy to clean up if something does get dropped or spilled on it we will be buying more of these but in different colors 
very good it works great my only problem with it is that it comes with an adhesive protective band and it takes forever to be able to take the glue off the slicer 
a wonderful tool the global quot is a great knife that comes with a very sharp edge it is rather light at least for a quot knife and is well balanced it is well situated for both slicing meats and cutting and dicing vegetables as it is easy to hold the knife forward towards its blade for a quick and balanced wrist action the only reason i gave this knife stars and not five is due to the handle while it is dimpled it can still get slippery when cutting fatty meat i would prefer a synthetic handle covering but otherwise this is a well designed tool perhaps the best chef s knife available now 
versatile and good additional piece the quart saucepan is a great piece the lid has perforated holes to allow either steam to excape or when cooking pasta the elimination of using a colander the lip is a nice touch and much appreciated in a larger saucepan whose use extends beyond reduction sauces gravies and hot beverages good to boil potatos and pasta probably deep enough to use as a double boiler for a small amount of melting but have not tried yet coated to withstand metal utensils but it is safer to use silicone easy clean up but you must buy a hard anodized cookware cleaner or expect stains nice versatile sized item 
chrome microwave cart i found this item to be very useful although i do not have a microwave sitting on the top shelf i still find it very sturdy for holding other items i did not have a problem putting it together even though i am not mechnically inclined i like the idea of being able to adjust the shelves to fit whatever size item you put on it i would recommend this cart to other people for their storage needs 
form proceeds function with this set of dishes i fell in love with the graceful lines and understated elegance of this set but when the pieces were delivered it quickly became apparent that this oversized set is not designed for everyday use the pieces are difficult to fit into my dishwasher as well as the dishracks purchased to help organize my cupboards the mugs are huge and would require many pots of coffee when entertaining guest unless you want to fill them only part way the bowls which can be ordered separately are designed to gorge if one was to actually fill them to capapcity not to mention from what i have discovered during my research on the net apparently they are quite easy to chip and are limited in thier safeness in the dishwasher and microwave both on low heat settings i love the look of them but it is probably not one of my wiser investments 
corelle lifestyles pewter dishes pc set i ordered the dishes and love the plates and bowls they are light weight and don t take up much room in my cabinet they aren t gray or pewter colored they re more of a tan to brown color i like the pattern i am however disappointed in the mugs they are a great size and look beautiful but are very heavy approximately ounces each i have other stoneware mugs about the same size that are much thinner and weigh a lot less making it easier to hold and drink a full cup of coffee 
excellent knife sharpener we have expensive knife and several cheaper knives this sharpener does an excellent job of sharpening all our knives 
west bend wok i purchased this item as a christmas present for my daughter inlaw she had one previously but it wore out and we were unable to find a replacement she absolutely loves the west bend wok and says one of the features she especially likes is the fact that it maintains a certain temperature throughout the whole cooking process rather than low medium or high with the control switching off as soon as it reaches that temperature it is easy to clean and hopefully will last forever 
nova brown spoon rest this spoon rest is a great compliment to the rest of the nova brown dishes it is a very different style the picture doesn t do it justice true hand made pottery 
why spend hundreds of dollars i admit i m a vacuum cleaner fanatic if there is such thing but we have a cat and my wife has asthma we have had two dirt devil bagless vacs for several years they did a good job but i couldn t stand having to bang the filters to clean them i did a bit of window shopping and decided to try this bissell it didn t take long to convince me this is a super buy the amount of material this picked up even though i had used the dirt devils within the past few days was amazing i was even motivated to used the attachments and vacuum under the bed ! emptying is a snap and the dirt cup can then be rinsed off great i can t imagine that a dyson for times the price can do any better i was also surprised at how easy this machine is to maneuver it just glides around the carpets 
not an expert but very pleased anyway reading some of the other reviews makes me believe that i m probably the least experienced in sharpening tools i m just a home cook not a professional or expert but i found this product extremely easy to use and i have to say it took my most damaged knife and put it razor sharp in no time at all the instructions are easy to follow if i have one very minor concern it would be the plastic handle it catches when i try to rotate it open and i m afraid it might break fairly easy i just leave it open all the time other than that i would recommend this sharpener absolutely 
perfecting for perfectionist in her perfect bed room i just got mine today loved it bought more in different sized what i loved about was the sense of freshness and cleanness in the fact this covers up entire pillow in easy slip then seal it tight with a zipper when you rest your head on the pillows i have standard queen king sizes plus memory foam pillow not only it fits but also its soooo comfortable unlike any other allergen barrier cover that is noisy and bulky i am not set for the entire house bed rooms perfect cover ! are you a perfectionist i am not 
kudo s to oster s engineers this is the best blender i have ever owned ! they have done away with the awful rubber gear and replaced it with a much more stable metal connection plus it has several handy attachments good job oster ! 
excellent cutting board i was pleasantly surprised the craftmanship of this board is better than i thought it would be i was skeptical about the harder than maple claim but we ve used it a lot and it still looks brand new it s definitely a cut above our maple board it looks as good as the picture but the colors are a little more muted it measures x x and weighs in at about lbs nice quality board i highly recommend it 
cosco jumbo stool this is a sturdy and attractive stool excellent for seating while working in the kitchen as well as for getting to the out of reach cabinet shelves 
vaccum review overall it was a good choice it s got great suction and i like the fact that there are no bags the only negative is that it is rather heavy and difficult to carry up and down stairs otherwise it s a great choice 
fast shipping and nice flowers i surprised a friend with these flowers they arrived in two days and they are pretty close with the site photo even with the shipping taxes included they are cheaper than the romanian roses to bad that they are not shipping in romania update after days from the receiving day the roses are still fresh and they smell very nice i am so glad that i could make someone happy with these very nice roses 
works great no problems i weigh flour for waffles and bread to a tenth of an ounce as for the on offtare switch it could be a little frustrating if you got one that s too touchy but mine works fine no regrets 
fantastic blender this is an absolutely fantastic blender runs smoothly and is quiet ! i love the glass container too don t let the factoryreconditioned scare you my blender came without a scratch or blemish looks absolutely brand new and works like a dream ! this is the second ka factory reconditioned product i ve bought from amazon and both products have been superb and much higher than my expectations ! i don t think you will be disappointed with purchasing the blender 
great and easy to use product i bought this for my husband because he s always wanted one to make beef jerky and we love it it takes about day and a half to make the jerky and he is always experimenting with different seasonings it s super easy to use and super quiet too we have a three year old daughter who loves the dried bananas and apples we make i love it because the dried fruit can last months and is great to take on long trips or for snacks i searched and searched for the right one for the right price and amazon provided it i would highly recommend this product to anyone who likes dried food 
our fondue fountain we bought this fountain with the intention of using at our wedding later this year we ve already tried it out with chocolate and it was wonderful ! so much fun just to look at let alone dip into and there are so many possibilities for types of dipping items plus although there were a lot of pieces to clean everything breaks down easily and cleans quite simply we re looking forward to trying it with cheese too just make sure to read the directions and maintenance warnings before using it to be sure it works properly and lasts a long time this is definitely a fantastic item to own and entertain with 
it is shaaaaaarp i bought one for my daughter a year ago and finally bought one of my own recently and it is the most amazing knife imaginable as a vegetarian i use it constantly for chopping and so on and it is simply effortless money very well spent as i know it ll last a lifetime 
great laptop desk i bought this on amazon back in january i love it use it almost every day very light weight and helps my legs cool i have a mac book pro and got the i could fit the mouse on the space but choose not too almost too tight to fit the laptop and a mouse i highly recommend this product 
picture is misleading i agree with the other reviewer the picture is misleading bissell does actually sell the pad brush combination amazon should strive to make sure the picture does represent the product or give a clearly seen disclaimer conversely i was not unhappy at all with the product received as i can use the pads a lot more than the brush attachment 
very pleased i love this pattern and this butter dish is no exception it washes very easily in the dishwasher and is a nice addition to my growing collection of this pattern 
why not if you have tried french press before and are looking for a good one there is no reason to look elsewhere i have not tried any other models but bodum has a great reputation and it works as advertised i have had mine a year and never broken anything and it works great my understanding is that the only other real option is with a thermal carafe that keeps the coffee hot longer but you don t want this as far as i understand the reason is that in a french press the coffee if not poured right away keeps on getting extracted as it sits there there should be nothing needed to keep warm if you are serving right away if you have not yet tried french press and this is the reason you are scanning reviews please note that you trade off a little more time compared to drip for an explosion of flavor and complexity the oils that are filtered out in a drip machine less so with a gold filter are left in the coffee with french press so you get much more thickness and flavor with this method there is more tweaking and you need a burr grinder to do it right but that s fun if you like to play around a little the reason you shouldn t use a blade grinder is that there is much more variation in the size of the coffee grinds so some of the coffee will end up extracted unevenly introducing bitter flavors in coffee that should not be there a burr grinder needn t be expensive and i found one on amazon for around that i am happy with arielonote it all boils down pun intended to how important coffee flavor is to you and preference i have tried drip coffee after french press and really can t go back it is that big of a difference please note that the freshness of coffee and quality personally i go with peet s is so important please don t buy sb s and for the most part expect a blow me away coffee experience it is fun to try single origin coffees and taste the differences on the other hand it s just coffee 
pleased received items in a timely manner could have purchased items locally but chose to do online instead thank you for the quick service 
they are small but beautiful well they do not have that marble texture but they still add alot to a room i have not burned the candles yet because i bought this item as a display i just love them 
it works unlike so many spot cleaners on the market for carpeting this one really works try it you ll like it especially if you have animals children or a very messy husband 
nicely made this is an simple contraption that makes our bathroom space more organised neat looks great also glad i d purchased this 
makes the room warm and fuzzy this product has several nice features that enable you to use this radiator either as a back up heat source or just as a room heater it s efficient not to large and the built in timer is relatively simple to use i have of these units and i feel they were well worth the investment 
very usefull very useful for storing my multiple journals spray painted easily so now it matches my decor using in my home yet planning to add to my office as well a good value 
great shower curtain i love the shower curtain and the detail that shows on all the dragon flys nice light details and color i also am impressed with the fact that it has metal rings around the holes for the shower rings to keep it from tearing i didn t notice that when i ordered it 
even my fat cat loves this i bought this after i read it was recommended by the author of cat vs cat i have cats a stuck up prissy female an obese lazy female and a psychotic energetic male i love this thing ! i am so amazed and very happy that all of them love this toy ! my stuck up cat usually never plays with cat toys only strings pens and straws my fat cat just never plays but is obsessed with watching out the window and talking to birds the male however was born in a feral cat colony but bottle fed by my step sister he has endless energy before i even got da bird out of its package he was excited the other two were sleeping we started playing and soon the fat one came downstairs to see what was going on before long i had my two females playing with it having put the male in a room the only thing you might want to consider is if you have a cat who is over possessive or wild he she may destroy the feathers before a normal cat would my male cat was so nuts over this he actually was tiring himself out to the point of panting the problem is when he would actually catch da bird he will not let go and growls so the other cats don t want to play really if you think about it wild cats and some domestic catch birds then take them off to eat but as long as you don t allow them to get to aggressive with it you should be fine i definitely recommend this toy be sure you keep this somewhere your cats can t find it when you aren t playing with them 
amazing glasses these glasses are amazing ! they don t just loom good they are extremely functional as well you coffee can be extremely hot yet you can t feel it on the outside of the glass due to the double wall i highly recommend these for any coffe or tea drinker 
best and cleanest betta food so far hands down this is the best betta food i have used so far the rest of the betta food brands i have bought sinks to the bottom and then it will rot if you don t immediately clean it out and kill the fish so if you want good betta fish food then betta bio gold will save you allot of time cleaning your fish tank more then you should have to i just use a small container to put the fish food in and take them out with tweezers so i don t dump to many in and if after a few minutes there is some still left i use tweezers or a net to get the few remaining pellets of the top of the water instead of a bunch of sunken pellets which can be a pain to fish out 
for kittens of all ages do you have a kitten or perhaps a cat that thinks he s a kitten even though his whiskers are turning gray this is the toy for you ! i not only own it i have given it as a gift i have seven cats and not only do they play on this tree they sleep on it and most importantly they sharpen their claws on it thereby saving me the hassle of clawed furniture the one i own is now three years old and has held up well it looks like a well beloved baby blanket but it is still intact the price is very reasonable compared to other cat climbing playing structures i ve seen and if you need to store it it is easily moved from one room to another but don t be surprised when kitty sees it in the new room and starts actinglike it s a brand new toy oh are you wondering about any negative aspects to the claw pals cat tree there is only one my pound cat tips it over 
coffee maker that rocks after much research and consideration i decided to buy this product as a christmas gift for my husband i am not the type of person to research products before i buy them but taking into consideration how picky my husband is about his espresso and being cuban and drinking cuban coffee since birth makes you critical and suspicious about the quality of the coffee made by these new espresso machines i did not want to buy something that was not going to meet our expectations i have to say this product has surpassed my expectations and my husband is very pleased with it my main concern was how hot the coffee would be and this product makes the coffee with the right temperature and richness that we have come to expect from the corner cafeteria coffee i ve read reviews about the noise it makes and after having the deloghi product the noise this machine makes when warming up is not that loud at all we are very happy with it buy it you ll be happy too 
my little work horse i ve had this little vac for about a month now and i use it all the time and just love love love it it s great for the rv and it s just what i needed for my entry room and kitchen using it in these rooms which only takes a couple of minutes every day keeps the mess out of the rest of the house and soooo easy now i don t have to drag that big vac around the house so often the dirt devil is easy to use and it s easy to clean it s light weight and does a great job on my floors and flat carpeting and it holds a charge for as long as i ve needed it so far maybe or minutes at a time this is the best purchase i ve made in a long time and i highly recommend this little work horse 
great gate but read my review before buying i just bought this gate because i needed something semi permanent in my living room to keep my new puppy from running all over the house my first gate looked very cheap and kept falling down because it didn t have a door and i just propped it against the wall i needed a gate with a door i checked at least different sites besides amazon for a rich looking gate with a door i landed on this one pros looks nice and elegant the door swings open both ways very nice brown tan much nicer than the plastic grey colors like grayco solid design wood and steel nice the gate locks at the top and the bottom at the same time making it impossible for my puppy to push his way through at the bottom lock is nicely positioned but see in the cons below cons only the door is wood all of the gate material is metal would be nicer is the entire gate was the same wood and the hardware was metal the door does not swing degrees open the door only opens to about degrees so because it s not flush with the gate my dog or kids sometimes run into it the color of the gate does not match the door it s close and it compliments it but it s not a match the rubber feet that touch the wall im not talking about the adjuster knobs because they are brown to hold it in place against the wall are grey at this price they should be brown to match the gate i don t know how the company missed this one the handle to open the gate only works in babyproof mode i which you could deactivate the thumb button and make it so that you only have to lift up on the handle to open not the thumb lift up just a convenience thing it s sometimes a little tricky when both your handles are full with grocery bags the screws are shiny silver they should have painted them brown as well richell it your reading this you could have anodized them dark brown like some many other screws that way they re less noticeable this is the biggy important this gate only works in certain segments unless you re really handy with tools and a welding torch you must pay attention to this this gate will only fit on the following openings no exceptions to with no side gates just door to with one side gate attached to with both side gates attachedwhen i bought this gate i didn t understand this and i was lucky that my opening is if it was only i would have had to return this gate there is no way around this overall this is a quality gate but just know what you re getting i would buy this gate again if i had to make this choice all over i gave this gate stars instead of because only the door was wood if the gates and door were wood i would have given it stars 
good space heater the heater is quite good my only complaint is that there is no real temperature control it has an on off control whenever it is on it blasts the full heat the on period can be controlled probably also the fan speed nothing else however for its price it is a good piece 
perfect addition to the milano chair this was a perfect addition to the milano chair it s well built and sturdy enough to use as an extra seat should the need arise i was skeptical about buying furniture on line with only a picture to go by but have no regrets 
greatest thing since tunafish my son is a chef and recommended this item being an obedient mother i purchased it it was fabulous it cuts as fast as he does and just as evenly sliced i recommend it to everyone who wants to make a great presentation ! p s as usual my chefy was right on 
love that thumper this will be the third thumper i ve bought lost the first one on a trip second is still going strong after or years and the third is for a gift it s simple to use loud enough to wake you and doesn t mind a good smack in the morning when you want more minutes the thumper pad is big enough to hit when you re groggy ! more products should be as easy to live with as this one ! 
malfunctioned within a year while i loved the features of this timer especially the ability to run multiple countdowns at once i bake a lot and varying baking times require concurrent timers to prevent errors my unit started freezing apparently a common problem with this model after about months of use the buttons are indeed flimsy and pressing them a little to hard often would cause the unit to reset itself losing any and all countdowns already in progress this unit was not inexpensive i d rather have separate single timers next time especially a model not know for freezing up i dot not recommend this time 
great buy i agree with previous reviewers that the vacuum is noisy but no noisier than my previous vacuum cleaners theyre supposed to be noisy the only problems i have are that the hose does not stretch very far from the vacuum and the hose does pop out every once in a while and i don t notice it until cat hair and debris is flying around the air instead of being deposited into the canister other than these two issues i have had this vacuum cleaner almost years now and i like it the belt broke on it today but this is the first time it has exceptional sucking power and the power spinning brush attatchment for the hose is excellent for picking up cat hair from the stairs and couches the warranty is the best i could find for this priced vacuum it also has a heppa filter all the features that come with this vacuum make it an awesome buy 
sonic electric jewelry cleaner machine i bought this as a gift for my mom and she said she loved it ! she said all her jewelry is clean and sparkley again it was lightweight and a perfect size for countertop use 
great at the price i am very pleased with this product for the price i paid for it it is sturdier than i expected can hold a somewhat surprising amount of laundry small items on the lower rods bigger things on the upper and folds remarkably flat an optimal dryer might be shaped to make sure rods aren t quite so on top of each other so that things hanging down don t drip onto other things but that s a small complaint i repeat i feel i got an excellent bargain on this drying rack 
great quality item for the price you can t beat the quality and size of this dish i d like several more 
best coffee mug out there period i ve always been on a search to find the best coffee mug that includes all the features that serious coffee drinkers are looking for keeps the beverage hot for hours when sealed it does not leak at all easy to drink from and dribble free suitable for right and left hand drinkers fits into most car cup holders clips to straps loopshandles to carry easily even when filled easy to clean and stays stain smell free rubber accents provide non slip grips and doesn t make a clanking noise when the mug is set down on the conference table high quality construction for durability it looks really cool this mug has with out a doubt ended my search for the perfect coffee mug i look at all others now and laugh because they pale in comparison to this mug finally a company has created the ultimate coffee mug for even the most demanding user this is a fantastic mug and is definitely worth the price 
works as it is intended i purchased this to keep our cats off of the dining room table we ve used it for a few weeks now and they no longer go on the table the only thing now which is a credit to the product is that i no longer have a use for it for the time being i m sure my cats will find something else to climb on before long that will warrant its use again 
excellent cutlery from a respected maker i bought this set for my wife for christmas mainly because i was stuck on ideas as to what to get her she spends a lot of time in the kitchen and she had been using an old set of chicago cutlery and several unbranded cheap giveaway knives for several years none of those knives were that great or that sharp and i hated trying to put an edge on them even though i m pretty good at sharpening knives essentially knives are just sharpened pieces of steel that appear to be pretty simple straightforward instruments that shouldn t be difficult to produce but a little experience with some poor examples prove this to not be the case like most seemingly simple things the simplicity is an illusion my experience has not been with kitchen knives but it has been with working knives pocket knives and fixed blade knives designed for hard use in the nasty jobs i have to do daily from removing staples in papers at the office to chopping down woody weeds in the backyard to cutting up boxes rope cording and thin pieces of aluminum i know the value of a blade that can take a good edge and hold it through a lot of abuse i did a little research and found several brands of kitchen knives that had universal respect wusthof always was at or near the top of everyone s list more often than not it was number one in the reviews and surveys i came across my wife was a little apprehensive about the sharpness of the knives out of the box she quickly realized the value of a really sharp kitchen knife and in no time she was commenting on how much easier it was to work with the wusthof s than the cheapo knives she had been using she has really been making good use of the paring knife and the chef s knife in the days since christmas my own limited use of the chef s knife from this set confirms how well it handles and cuts compared to the clunky chicago cutlery chef s knife after looking over more reviews i ve ordered the wusthof hollow edge santoku to go with this set designed for thin cuts it will fit in well with the other knives i ll probably also get a serrated edge bread knife in the not toodistant future to round out the wusthof set this is likely to be a lifetime purchase for our household and that makes the high price more of an investment i m well pleased and so is my wife 
love them these end tables are very easy to asseble and look great a great buy for the money the bases were slightly scratched on one side but i was able to flip the piece over so the scrath is underneath no one will ever know 
excellent and very attractive first this is more accurately called a sauce pot rather than a saucepan its about inches at the bottom and gradually flares to inches at the top it s inches tall wo cover and it has two loop handles which are easy to grasp the pot is not too heavy but it heats very evenly and the nonstick works well and looks perfect after months of heavy use i don t use metal utensils the curved bottom makes stirring and scraping easier and i find the domed glass cover helpful clean up is a cinch i do handwash i ve found this pot to be very versatile for sauces risotto chili rice pastas soups stews start on the stovetop and finish in the oven and even smaller batches of stock because you can fill it almost to the top last but not least this pot is nicely compact for its capacity and is attractive enough to put on the table nice sleek lines ! i recommend this without reservation 
love this i bought the litter locker plus as we had ferrets and wanted to dispose of their litter in a way where it would not smell as with ferrets you change the litter box twice daily i love it you do not smell any urine or poo and the refills are so easy to change i will be purchasing the litter locker plus with refills for my mom and her cat 
kitchenaid mixer i purchased a factory reconditioned kitchenaid mixer back in september i was so excited about the price and have been wanting one for so long it took only days to get the mixer once i purchased it i couldn t wait to use it i just love it it is so much easier making bread cookies etc i would definately recommend this mixer or any other kitchenaid mixer i have been very pleased with the performance price and ease of use thanks andrea abbottlayton u 
great pans awful lids i bought this set to replace my year old farberware set because altho still perfectly fine after all these years i thought that thicker pans would cook better on my new gas stove and they do no doubt about it ! way less splattering and burning which is what i was hoping for however my old pans had domed lids which allowed you to confine the condensation inside by quickly turning them upside down as you lifted them and you could even set them down on the counter this way the kitchenaid pans have almost flat lids and the liquid usually ends up on the stove there is no way you can set the lid down anywhere without making a mess very nice pans for the money but i m not sure i would buy them again 
love it ! i just love the euro pro shark i have a dog and it is great for picking up loose dog hair and little crumbles from his dog food i use it several times a week it is light quiet and really does a good job at picking up dirt lint and pet hair i have had other cordless sweepers and nothing compares to the euro pro shark it is a great purchase 
warm love it so warm and great quality great price it is exactly what i have been looking for 
lots of light i love this booklight it s small and light so it doesn t weigh down the book and the color of the light it gives off is excellent not to mention the amount of space it covers it is good for reading knitting or any small projects for which you would need spot lighting 
very cute but requires responsibly i have this tank sitting on my desk at the office and have had a beautiful healthy beta living in it for over two months this is wonderfully adorable novelty item and it looks very cute in my cubicle the important thing to remember is that this is a fish you are committing to take care of if you are willing to put in the effort great ! if not do not buy this what i have been doing is this get a beta not a goldfish goldfish need more room than this tank can supply and also would prefer a filter change the water often i do a small water change or times a week i only use filtered water i am sure to let it stand for several hours so that it adjusts to room temperature and i use a water conditioner designed for betas do not overfeed about once a month i carefully move my fish into another bowl with the most of the fish tank water and rinse out the tank my fish seems very happy and loves swimming in over under through and around the furniture exploring his environment he even sometimes lurks in the file cabinet ! his fins are long and beautiful and have never gotten caught on any sharp edges the only concern i have for him is that he might eventually get bored since the furniture is locked down and can t be rearranged to provide stimulation for the fish but other than that i think that with the proper care a beta can be very happy living in his office 
love my whirley pop i use my whirley pop every day i bought a lb bag of popcorn from sams as my niece suggested i go to weight watchers so this method of making popcorn works very well for my diet the popcorn tastes so much better than air popped 
great nightlight alternative never replace a bulb dirt cheap to operate several companies sell this exact same light included one sold at home depot it s a single led light that uses watts you will never need to replace the bulb light is slightly blue in color it does not put off as much light as a watt standard nightlight bulb it does not put off as much light as the picture shows it seems brighter when viewed from above such as from a floor outlet 
works like a champ i would recommend this to anyone it works as advertised i use it on my laminate floors that until now i could not get as clean as i wante 
love it this knife is the best i ve ever held and or used ! it feels great in the hand esp during prolonged use for a smaller female with a weak wrist this knife is the perfect weight lighter than a german knife but just as powerful i don t think i will ever switch brands again the only thing is that i wish i had bought the version with the slots to help with the release of food from the blade reguardless i love this knife 
i want one too i bought this pillow for my husband and i can attest that it is very comfortable and has left him feeling refreshed in the mornings from getting a good night s sleep finally yes if you like high pillows you ll need to put another pillow under it but we ve always slept with two pillows anyway

bean bag chair fantastic great product and great customer service my daughter just loves it 
works great i bought this to replace an earlier version that had just plain worn out this new model is much improved nice size sturdy plastic and it does well at trapping the grounds good product if you are looking for a travelling coffee press 
great coffee machine i purchased this for work as i have the same unit for home the choices in coffees and teas for use in the machne have greatly increased it is simple to operate and there is no miss to worry about and best of all i don t have to risk the chance of having a cup of paint removing liquid that someone is trying to pass of as coffee from the community pot 
makes a pretty cake if you re careful you ll get compliments on your daisy cake if you take care in preparing the pan for baking and in adding a glaze i had trouble unmolding my first cake with nordicware s wildflower pan so i contacted the company for help they advise using crisco and wondra flour although i prefer butter the crisco worked far better but i took extra time to use a pastry brush to apply the crisco to ensure getting into every nook and cranny i did not like the recipe that came with the pan so i asked about additional recipes the only response was to use a standard cake mix this was not very satisfying as i prefer from scratch cakes however i do sometimes use a cake mix that i doctor up and have been pleased with the results even the addition of grated citrus rind in a glaze can disturb the lovely pattern of the cake and even a thin glaze must be applied very carefully or the flower petals will break up 
excellent grill frying pan this frying pan allows you to grill almost like on a barbecue and with little oil or butter cleanup is easy if you soak pan first and then hand wash since it is not recommended for the dishwasher i like this pan so much i bought one for all the ladies that cook in my family 
very nice i bought this set for a recent camping rv trip worked out great attractive unbreakable and practical 
fast means hot i have had microwave rice cooker before this they were always hard to meet my satisfaction andante that was the problem the last one was even from thailand from my trip and it did not work well either but when i found this from here i wanted to test if it works any better i noticed the cone shaped bottom and i think it makes the difference after all i cooked rice in it either with the zatarain s prepared rice sachet or any rice for steaming they all turned out great if it is getting dry because each microwave has different wattages you have to figure out how long it takes to cook great sticky rice if the rice turns out too dry i just add one cup of water and boil for another min and simmer it never ever failed once the reason for star is for pop corn issues i followed the instruction for the right amount and the time but it would only pop the half of it in min and i have to empty the first popped corns and run for another min to pop the rest but then again i have panasonic microwave panasonic nn tsf full size cubicfoot watt and some reviewer below already warned that popping corn in panasonic could be disastrous and i am watching it all the time the popping corns left some brown mark at the bottom but the container itself is really sturdy and would not get stained from zatarain s rice so for rice cooking mainly i would recommend this steamer 
great starter yanagiba i recently began working in a sushi bar where i was required to invest in my own knives i wanted a good knife but didn t want to pay an exorbitant amount some yanagiba and other sushi knives can cost upwards of a piece ! i purchased this bunmei yanagiba knife and have found it exceeded my expectations the blade is constantly exposed to moisture from fish vegetables fruit and cleaning and is rust free thus far it s easy to care for and holds a great edge i use this yanagiba mainly for slicing sashimi and sushi rolls it cuts effortlessly through most things and the grip is comfortable even when my hands are wet as a bonus it arrived with a mean factory edge ! i didn t even have to pre sharpen it and haven t had to sharpen it once after a week of moderate to heavy use highly recommended for starters who ve never worked with japanese cutlery before 
in accurate picture comfortable loveseat two points that have me disappointed with this item are the color of this loveseat is actually a lot darker in person than depicted in the picture also i recieved this loveseat without any of the required hardware or tools to put it together it was left out of the package so i had to go to the hardware store and figure out and buy my own to get this thing together aside from those two problems the loveseat is actually very solid and comfortable to lounge in i like the nice suede like fabric 
great pillows for kids loved this pillow it is a lot of fun 
great deal this knives are great i got a great deal on them and they are good quality 
great addition to my collection i just got this lovely lasagna baker free by buying another place settings to add to the i already own in the gold dust green pattern i was really happy to find it and several other companion pieces here at amazon because i have had trouble finding them in the regular stores the pan is very large but not bulky or overly heavy the gold dust green finish is beautiful on this piece and it will look really great on the table with my other pieces a company size lasagna will fit in this pan and i also think i could squeeze a couple of chickens in it the pan and the set of dishes were packed very carefully and i had no breakage whatsoever 
great buy we use the fryer in a small to go restaurant setting we sell barbeque but use the fryer for frys hot wings fish and pork chops we use the machine daily and have had great service from it i would recommend it for the user who frys light to medium duty it is not good for the large chain type cooking because of the size only the machine is good and sturdy enough for the home cook and the small restaurants 
richell one touch adjustable gate i really am truly satisfied with this product the dimmension where it set up is different at top and bottom due to the base boards the gate can adjust for this and is just as secure i also like the fact that i found less expensive then ordering it from the manufacturer 
first allergy pillows but these are really nice they don t make noise they don t feel or sound like plastic and my husband has been commenting on his good sleep since i got them and i don t know if he noticed that i even put them on the pillows after washing they feel just like regular pillow cases and are quite cool to the touch which i like since my face and feet always get too warm while i sleep i purchased the standard size cases and didn t realize i had jumbo pillows but they still fit they are just a bit fat so it is nice that the size isn t made to be perfectly small 
very good for knives this holder for knives does exactly what i want it to do safely transport very sharp knives back and forth to my church culinary chores without taking a chunk out of an unsuspecting colleague i give it only four stars because it doesn t seem quite as good as some similar products i ve seen on various food network documentaries which seem to easily carry things which are a lot less flat than the average knife but if the price is right and carrying knives is what you want get this product it is especially good at being stiff avoiding the risk of pushing a sharp tip out at you at an awkward moment 
very useful in a house that lacks storage space i use this item as additional pantry space the kitchen in my new apartment is small and didn t have enough space to store everything i hung this storage rack over the back of a closet door and use it for boxes of dry goods and some canned foods as well it holds quite a bit for its size and is very sturdy my one caution if you re going to hang this over the door use the included screws and clips to mount it to the door if you don t when you open close the door it rattles around a lot 
light show both my cat and dog love this the animals are able to close the lid very easily so you have to be there to open it again 
sturdy and convenient with six children myself and my husband sometimes just collecting the laundry from all over the house leaves me worn out that s why i like the wheels on this hamper they help conserve my energy and i need all the energy i can get plus this hamper can hold all the laundry from my laundry chute and it s construction seems sturdy it was pretty easy to assemble 
cake pans these pans are made by ekco and durable the nice thing is they do not brown the edges like the tephlon coated ones just be sure to use wax paper on the bottom and they will come out with ease 
great heater though slighly large i bought this heater to head my bedroom finished basement the room is x with food ceilings the heater does a fantastic job at heating the room though takes a while hour to do so which is fine with me i really like the fact that it is dead quiet and has a convienent lcd timer my only complaint is that it is rather large long 
outstanding i own a considerable amount of fiesta i originally purchased it years ago because i wanted durable dishes that could be added to and allow for creativity i love all the colors and fiesta has been around since the s so i know i won t have any problems with replacement should any ever actually break all vitrified china has factory flaws fiesta does not allow its first quality pieces to have more than flaws there are seconds on e bay purchases made on e bay should be made with caution because many of these piece are second quality sold as firsts i learned the hard way if you want china for everyday use that can be added to or easily replaced than i strongly encourage you to buy fiesta if you change your dishware frequently then you might want to buy something cheaper that isn t meant to last 
excellent light weight pitcher this pitcher is the perfect size for entertaining it makes a lovely appearance and is light weight i had one in crystal and this is much better additionally it s a breeze to clean stars all around appearance weight capacity ease of cleaning and price ! 
comfortable sharp nice quality i first tried the shun chefs knife and loved it this paring knife is great everything i want from a paring knife sharp comfortable just flexible enough and a great grip 
hamilton beach indoor grill with removable grill timer this was an excellent purchase the grids are removable and go right in the dishwasher without any impact to the non stick coating it has an audible timer which also shuts off the grill making it a great purchase for the elderly who might not hear the timer this is the second time we ve purchased the grill we gave the first grill to our son after we d used it for a couple of years it was still like new and we d used it a lot we called around our local area looking for another hb grill and couldn t find one so we purchased a george foreman the features we were looking for especially the timer that shut the grill off were only available on the larger grills we re cooking for two and really didn t want the family size grill so we left it in the box and pursued the hb until we found one on amazon we re now happy grillers again and hope they never stop making the hb with the features we love 
a great fan ok now that we know the instructions are a little hard to follow and you only get the size you order let me review the fan itself the fan is very powerful the circumference shoots a comfortable blast of cool air at you and around you very well made the whole unit is very sturdy but not overbearingly heavy and it doesn t vibrate when you have it on high very easy to use the remote control makes it so you don t even have to leave your chair allinall a great fan 
kitchenaid silicone basting brush works as advertised no more bristles falling out on the food or stained brushes in the kitche 
wonderful towels these towels are my most favorite they are baby soft very absorbent and wash like a dream 
awesome little vacuum with lots of power i was in a second hand store and saw this little vacuum wasnt really looking for a vacuum but plugged it in to test it and was immediately impressed by the suction it had some of the best section power i had seen in any vacuum so i bought it and have been totally amazed by its capabilities its so light about nine pounds and easy to transport and store its power cord is on a reel that retracts into the vacuum at the touch of a button the bags are a bit small but its a small vacuum they are very easy to get at and change its the best vacuum for hardwood and kitchen floors along baseboards and on stairways not so good on deep pile carpets although it will do the job in a pinch i have three cats and gets lots of hair and dust and its great for a quick vacuuming this is a great second vacuum to augments a heavy duty upright my vacuum came with two attachments and the crevice tool many third party vacuum attachments would work with it too i am glad i bought it and would recommend it its the vacuum i would use most the biggest drawbacks to using a vacuum is the weight and unwinding the cord to use it and then rewinding it and your done push a button and the cord automatically rewinds whats not to like about this vacuum highly recommended 
great tray the ice cubes come out intact not chipped or cracked to get them out push each cube from the bottom with your finger for fastest and easiest results wait for minutes after taking the tray out of the freezer this way the ice cubes will pop right out if you don t wait your fingertip will be freezing while trying to push them out 
the vacuum cleaner i ve been looking for i ve had uprights for years and was tired of them not having enough suction this bagless canister vacuum has great suction good tools is light enough for me bad back and all and is easy to manage it is also very easy to detach the hose from the motorized floor beater for a quick swipe along the edges the canister is small so i ve gotten into the habit of dumping it after every use everything else makes it worth it 
sango nova blue ceramic spoon rest great ! i love it goes great with my kitchen 
excellent little kitchen tool i got this as a gift from my mother when i moved to my first apartment away from home she already had one and loved it i use mine quite frequently and makes quick work of dicing onions and peppers for philly steaks or burgers my brother and father have also since purchased these units i have had mine going on years now not a problem with it great value good gift for cooks for one or two who do not need a huge unit to chop stuff 
perfect for my studio aparment i have a studio with low pile carpet and a teensy kitchen and bathroom with linoleum i was so pleased to discover that this thing cleans both the pros the brush roller thing at the bottom does a great job picking up things from both the carpet and hair crumbs from the linoleum you don t have to mount the charging bracket it has a holder on the side for the battery by itself which pops out of the vacuum easily the roller thing is between wide which is a reasonable size to get in between pieces of furniture for me not as wide as your standard vacuumthe disappointments the roller thing doesn t come off i have been reluctant to use it as a dustbuster because it can leave marks if you re using it on more delicate surfaces than the floor like paint if you have cleaned up hair the roller thing is really annoying to clean the first time i used it i thought maybe i could just unscrew the cover take out the bar clean it and put it back do not do this all the moving parts are precariously placed inside the bottom i never did get the little wheels back inside now i just do the best i can with needlenose pliars from the bottom the upshot it s an inexpensive tool that does exactly what it s supposed to the roller cleaning problem will probably result in fewer years of use than otherwise but for the price it s a very reasonable problem to have 
spray commander is a great training tool i have a very young very energetic rottweiler she thinks it is great fun to dig holes in the yard i tried every trick in the book trying to break her of the habit at the age of a rottie can dig a very big hole very fast and i needed a solution before my yard looked like a mine field after doing some research on the internet i found spray commander i had to watch her carefully while she was in the yard and as soon as she started digging i gave her a blast of citronella button this scenario was played out more times results no more digging we ve had the product for about a year now and i think it s great easy to use painless and entirely effective 
great mixing bowls love the bright colors on these bowls they are super functional too and the sizes seems to work well for various mixing jobs 
ok for large pots but this is a great coffee maker if you make or more cups at a time when this machine arrived from amazon i had a house full of company so we used to to make full pots after the house guests left i went back to my morning ritual of making cups at a time and discovered that this machine just can t make a decent short pot of coffee i also discovered that it is a tiny bit taller than the specs say so it may not fit under your kitchen cabinets other than that it is built like a tank and nicely finished if you normally make smaller pots look elsewhere 
simple this product is a real convience for someone who uses alot of hard or soft boiled eggs easy to clean i never have to worry about not hearing the buzzer when the eggs are done it is very loud and very annoying 
amazing coffee but with some small inconveniences first there is a huge difference in making coffee with a bladed grinder vs a burr grinder the first pot i made with this krups i was hooked the appliance is pretty easy to use and it looks sharp too here are the downsides coffee does stick to the plastic container that holds the ground coffee which can make it difficult to operate without at least a little coffee not falling on your counter during grinding the beans will get hung up in the hopper causing the motor to whine a little because no beans are being ground i just pick the device up and shake it which remedies the problem the grind is a bit finer than i expected and the coarseness adjuster doesn t seem to do a whole lot of adjusting but again the coffee is wonderful ! it s not a perfect burr grinder but for the money and impeccable coffee i m willing to deal with the other slight drawbacks 
beautiful eating i love the fiesta rimmed soup bowls they hold cassaroles stews and salads for easy eating the new scarlet is a beautiful addition to our set the color is clear and bright and makes me want to get out the valentines 
wine saver yippee a fabulous product i have tried most of the other wine savers but this one sets the standard takes the guess work out of pumping the click tells it all thanks for making such a great product wine lovers rejoice ! 
meets our expectations we had heard good things from other people who have purchased le creuset products and it is easy to see why not only does it cook and clean well it is a beautiful addition to our home we hate to put it in a cabinet we are looking forward to the upcoming season to make soups and stews 
chemically sensitive beware the packaging for this fan i really like this fan nice design yes it is sleazy plastic but the only time i noticed it was during assembly quiet and powerful operation and the nature mode is a marvelous innovation nature mode slows the fan when it faces front so that you are spared a direct blast of air and a remote control is a luxury when you are too hot to move imho the sole design fault is the lcd display which is too small to read farther than two feet away howeverwhen i opened the shipping box a strong chemical smell overwhelmed me causing a headache and i am not chemically sensitive ! the smell disappeared after a few minutes as did the headache 
my year old loves this we also got the ladybug and lion for my year old and month old my year old thinks it s really cool to feed the ladybug his dirty clothes it sure beats them piling up on the floor ! this is a really fun way to get little kids accustomed to doing some of their own chores to help mommy clean up they really are pretty cute and the low price is a bonus 
should have waited i paid too much for these knives though they work well i should have shopped around 
love these glasses i love the large size of these glasses its great for swirling your wine we had a large party and everyone commented on how elegant they looked and how much fun they were to drink from 
my two cats love this we had the older smaller version and one cat liked it and the other didn t but they both like this one why i think it s because the water comes out higher and it reminds them of the bathtub faucet which they love to drink from 
my wife loves it my wife loves hot water for tea and straight she was always boiling water on the stove sometimes forgetting until it all boiled away i gave this to her as a gift and she now uses it all the time works great saves time saves money the cordless feature is great 
it does not have a sound option i bought one of these based on the amazon product description that says it has a sound option when i received it i found it does not and only has spray capabilities saying that it seems to work well and so far is deterring our cat from spraying the piece of furniture the kit is protecting 
wonderful sheets these sheets feel great i just love sleeping on them i have never had sheets this great for the price i paid the only drawback is that they wrinkle 
very beautiful piece of furniture ! great price i assembled it all by myself while my husband was at work and boy was i pleased with myself ! the chest took me hours which i think was pretty good since i was doing it alone plus my year old daughter kept distracting me a few times ! the only real problem came when i started assembling the drawers you could not put the guides in the holes they had drilled for you because it wouldn t line up right you had to move them all the way to the side the bottom drawer sticks more than the others but i can deal with that maybe one of these days i will get around to trying to fix that i have noticed that the drawers open better when you squat down to the level of the drawer to pull it open i have had no problems with knobs falling off as other people have stated though in box the end table was in the knobs were broken in the package i called the manufacturer and they are sending me two new knobs don t know when they ll arrive though there also was one part of assembling the chest that i had to skip because the screws it called to use were too small and too short for where they were supposed to go they were to go under the bottom of the decorative molding in front and screw through the top of the chest but the screw was way to small would not even go through the wood the top was screwed tightly down in another location so i skipped that step and you could not tell and it functions just fine very sturdy and i highly recommend it if you are wanting something not too expensive 
i love them these spoons are great they have the heft of a wooden spoon and to me they feel very similar they do not stain you can throw them in the dishwasher and you can safely soak them if something gets dried caked on i plan to buy another set and put the rest of my wooden spoons out to pasture 
barbie vacume cleaner my daughter loves it she is and now she vacumes all the time i works really well you do have to charge it quite a bit it does not stay charged for a long time but i feel it is well worth the money 
awesome reading light this has been the best reading light we have seen so far ! we have purchased several trying to find one that was durable and met our needs and this one surpasses that the neck has smooth action and the clip is very easy to use i highly recommend this item 
mission hutch this is a beautiful matching piece to the desk i searched and searched for a mission desk hutch unit and this is by far the best buy around the wood is completely finished no rough spots or uneven color blends easy to put together 
super nice fan moves a lot of air nice controls well made great fan ! my only problem with it was i didn t pay any attention to the height dimensions and it won t fit in the window that i bought it for only negative is that it s not as quiet as i expected either 
doesn t fit perfectly in but works the filter model i have requires two of these with no foam spacers two of these were less expesnive than the single larger filter i purchased once previously however i d say that two small ones are about a quarter inch too tall maybe slightly less the cover still goes on but not as far down as it should as for filtering i estimate that it filters the same as the previous the permanence of this filter makes me wonder why i ve been replacing the previous style since i can see no difference in the filter material 
attractive and handy i have two of these one in yellow and one in a discontinued sea greeny color they re attractive of course this is fiestaware after all but they re darn functional they re long enough to accommodate a london broil or small roast or kebobs and they re deep enough that any juices are not likely to spill while you re carrying or serving i like wish there was one slightly bigger too then i d get two more 
strong magnet this is an excellent storage bar and compares to the more expensive ones we have we have put knives and stainless steel utensils on it and it holds everything strongly ! i recommend this to anyone looking for a good deal 
definitely worth the money i love mine ! i use another item with rotating brushes for my deep mopping but we use this little thing for daily clean ups and have had no problems with things spilling i ve washed the pads and have found them to come out of the wash clean i really only have two complaints one sometimes a little im talking about drops here definitely not a lot of the mopping solution leaks out during the vacuum cycle this is not a problem for me because i plan to mop after i vacuum anyway the other complaint is that you need to remember to change the pad after vacuuming if you plan to mop otherwise you mop with a dirty pad anyway we love ours and are thrilled to have found it 
fish smish this is a wok spatula i purchased a calphalon nonstick wok a little over a year ago and it s a wonderful piece of cookware however i can t use my regular wok tools due to its teflon like coating so i started searching for alternatives and came across isi silicone utensils though they are all wonderful i still needed something to replace the wok spatula and though this is supposedly designed for fish it has the same proportions the stainless teel handles and colored silicone are also very sharp looking 
very nice i am very pleased with this fryer it heats up quickly and does a great job frying foods unlike most consumer grade fryers this one barely blinks when you drop a basket of frozen fries other fryers choke lose so much heat and take so long to recover temperature that foods get soggy and clump together not with this baby i used a coupon got free shipping and there was a rebate for a stainless oil storage cannister this was a great deal 
best one i ve found yet this smokeless ashtray works extremely well at containing second hand smoke cleaning it can be a challenge however it works just as advertised ! recommend cleaning and changing the filters often to maintain the unit especially if you re a heavy smoker i m definitely sold on this item ! 
chocolate milk shake love this for making chocolate milk shakes for the grandkids and me 
great trash can for the price the second one i ve purchased wish they didn t use so much glue on the front label a real chore to remove 
extremely pleased with the fiestaware black lunch plate great item rec d it in wonderful shape packaged well to withstand droppage and anything else that might have happened to it 
good quality i own an original piece and there is no difference in quality whatsoever 
counter top trash can looks great i got this trash can to put on the counter next to my coffee maker for discarded sweet low packages i love how it fits in with my black and stainless appliances the item itself works pretty good for the most part the only issue i have found with it is the lid fits loosely on the base and slides off when putting something in it to remedy the issue i am planning to drill a tiny hole in the sides and out a tiny hand screw on each side of the lid to hold it firmly in place im not sure if a review is the appropriate forum to mention that actually finding this item or one like it on the web was very difficult to locate perhaps additional keywords can be added to the item to make it easier to find i used search terms like mini trash can counter top trash can small waste basket small stainless steel trash can but none of these got me to this item i m not sure how my husband finally found it 
great towel my husband and i have really enjoyed this product they are very soft and a good sized towel 
mr coffee a winner again this machine meets all my expectations and is easy to use i like the cupsize because by the time you brush your teeth voila your st cup is ready sincerely said frank 
great deal i ordered this sheet set mainly for the price but also because i was curious about the microfiber material after about a month of use i have no complaints it s lightweight and the microfiber feels great when sleeping i would definitely recommend this to others 
salton kmwht liter iced tea maker white this salton has a practical design and makes tea well i love this ice tea maker because of it works well and doesn t leak water all over the counter like other brands i ve tried my only wish is that it would come with an extra spare ice tea pitcher 
hot and stylish if you are looking for a mug that keeps your coffee hot all morning then this is the mug for you ! the top easily unscrews and aligns perfectly once screwed on to use the side handle the base is slip proof so if it s sitting on your desk and you knock into it it s not going anywhere besides all of it s great features it s also very stylish and well designed ! 
toastmaster sandwich maker the end result was ok but i felt the sandwiches were too squashed but edibl 
slow cooker works fine but smells like hot plastic when it cooks we ve only had this crockpot for a few weeks and used it a handful of times it cooks great but emits a smell of hot plastic when cooking there is no visible piece of packaging or wrapping material stuck anywhere and we can t figure out the odor source but we re hopeful that eventually the smell will go away otherwise it s a ok 
sharp knifes again i have chicago cutlery and other misc knives they were all to dull to cut soft butter when i received the sharpener my husband sharpened and honed them all what a pleasure to have sharp cutting utensils 
the best these are just the best everyone who drinks from them wants them i have several sets they re perfect for iced tea i wash them in the dishwasher and have yet to see one break from it 
vornado filters great performance and quick delivery sometimes can t be found in stores this solves my shopping delema 
emerilware stainless cookware i ve had this cookware almost a year and really like it the glass lids allow me to see inside the pot as it s cooking and i don t find that the lid gets hot like others have reported the small loop handles on the pots do get hot but i just use a hotpad i don t have a problem with food sticking as i don t cook on high heat i bought a nonstick pan to compliment the set and use that when needed the copper around the bottom of these stainless pans is so pretty but will tarnish it cleans up so quickly and easily you just wipe with barkeeper s friend cleaner i can t wait to have a house again and hang these pretty pans 
very practical and good looking product this wood stand is exactly what i have been looking for it blends in well with other wood furniture the base doesn t take much room and is surprisingly quite stable 
lupine collars are the best we ve found this collar is bright and pretty but more importantly it is strong a year ago i had my dog break out of a similar collar by another manufacturer she suddenly pulled on her leash to chase a squirrel the plastic latch released and she was off in a busy city street it was a frightening experience that made me realize that i needed to find a stronger collar the lupine collar we got her is the strongest i ve found and the lifetime guarantee lets me know that they are confident that the collar won t deteriorate this collar is cute lightweight and very safe i highly recommend it 
nice cup this is a nice cup the top was easy to get off once i figured out it unscrews i d give it stars if it was dishwasher safe but it keeps coffee nice and hot and isn t tippy so i am darn happy with it 
whirley pop stovetop popcorn popper this is a great popcorn popper not only is the popcorn the best but cleanup is a snap will never go back to microwave popcorn 
small but good i like this style of salad spinner when i ordered it though i didn t realize that it is as small as it is it would be adequate for one person who doesn t chow down on salad all day i recomend the product if you don t have much salad to spin 
this is a charming item worth the investment a perfect deep well shaped big ozs in a great shade of almost crimson red consider this an investment for lots of fun meals from valentines day to christmas and even harvest dinners i was impressed at how large the container is for it s shape easily holding enough of any treat for two or a main dish for one right off we used it for a nut dish and got many compliments on its charm so i went back and ordered more ! 
love it ! worth it this is a great blender ! yes it is expensive but it is worth it ! if you just want to make the occasional smoothie you might not want to spent that much but even if you did you would find it well worth the money and probably the only blender you will ever need to buy it is strong and it lasts you can make your own flour it can blend all parts of apples etc skin and all you can make hot soup just by using the blender nothing else and with the same machine you could make ice cream there is millions of uses and it is super strong ! i very highly recommend it 
must have i absolutely love this cutting board ! it makes cutting a lot easier it is big enough to cut many differnt things and keep them all on the board the board is very sturdy and heavy but clean up was not bad at all i had no problem handling it it is not for someone with a small sink and not a lot of kitchen space i also ordered the mystery mineral oil to preserve it i know that this board will be around for a long time 
great little pig i use this alot and enjoy it i also use it for grill cheese sandwhiches and it works great it cleans up nicely 
multifunctional pan you can do a lot with this besides make cornbread any kind of muffin mix seems to work 
amazing hands down the absolute best cookware ive ever tried and i love to cook ok so the debate about teflon getting hot and gassing off is scary swiss diamond says they dont have the same problem as everyone else with the diamond coating who really knows the good news is that the diamonds really do work they say they transfer heat better oh ya i have to cook with lower heat so for me that pretty much lessens the hot teflon scare the top of the skillet is just as hot as the bottom so the claim about heat transfer is true its amazing ! they have the coating on the outside as well i presume to transfer the heat quickly and uniformly they say diamonds are slick for sure i can fry and egg with no oil well allmost none and come out sunny side up without breaking its thick and cast pretty heavy but thats a good thing for us its ok because the handle fits your hand the vent is a great idea and why anyone would make a lid you cant see thru doesnt get my hard earned buck i am sold on german power tools and use nothing else but german or japaneese tools no that does not incude chinese now im sold on swiss cookware i will still never use a metal utensil even if they say its ok because i dont want down time for a new skillet i love this thing and would highly recomend it i find myself planning dinner on what i can cook in my new tool you will fall in love the minute you take it out of the box and hold it in your hand its so well made it just feels good and you know it was worth every penny because its the last one you will have to buy ! 
fiestaware bread tray this bread tray is just the right size and the perfect finishing touch to a table set with fiestaware 
kitchen staple i have had this multi cooker for years and i still love it i started out using it to steam clams and crab legs then i went on to use it as a stock pot it s great for quickly reducing to freezable size i recently have found a great hot wings sauce kens and have been using my true blue multi cooker as a fryer and it is working out great i just love this thing it is easy to clean up it s light and easy to handle it heats up quickly and has had no technical problems i love being able to tell what temperature i am cooking on can set degrees not just high medium or low temps and be able to see through the glass lid at how the contents are doing this is definitely a kitchen must have 
bladed steel cheese slicer i have purchased nearly a dozen cheese slicers in the past all with wire cutters on them and every one has failed within a year because the wire breaks or corrodes this is the first cheese slicer i ve found with a solid blade in place of the wire for cutting it cuts nearly as well as a wire does and has the distinct advantage of being nearly indestructible it can also be cleaned in the dish washer and is easy to clean by hand i bought three one for me and one for each of my grown children all of whom love to slice block cheese for various snacks thanks amazon for stocking this great cheese slicer 
a very good sturdy choice this step stool is very acceptable the only reason i gave it stars is because i had to get used to it when you step down the steps are not as staggered as you might expect however it is very stable and locks in place 
works for me the product came in a timely manner it was easy to set up and suits my needs perfectly i m glad i purchased it 
great design beautifully uniform scoops after too many bent spoons to count we broke down and bought this scoop its engineering has exceeded my expectations on a couple of fronts first the scoop itself has very thin but strong edges that slice easily into even hard ice creams with less effort than other scoops i ve tried second the shape of the scoop does indeed produce beautifully round spheres of your favorite frozen dessert ideal for anyone who values presentation and function 
it does its job well there are things to note i like this product and i use it nearly every day it goes well with a french press and heating water to deg f is its primary function at other times i used it to help a large pot of water for cooking pasta come to a boil much sooner things to note the brushed exterior is convenient it doesn t pick up smudges like a polished one would the qt capacity is great when boiling water for a larger pot it s fast it gets water to a boil very quickly especially if you don t fill the whole pot qt will boil really quickly not just in half the time of qts the indicator window gets steamed and is barely of use ok i see how much to not fill it max line the switch appears flimsy but there s not much to stress it a subtle red light indicates the switch is on initially i used to leave the switch on after pouring out the water but now i know what to look for at this point i don t regret that it could have been brighter because it stays subtle in the kitchen in a multi user kitchen you might want to mention that the on indication is very low key when boiling the kettle takes a bit more delay than i d expect to switch off and indicate the water s boiling with a quiet click by that time the sound of bubbling alerts me i haven t detected any weird smell i did two boils with fresh water before using it the spout is definitely designed for slow pouring it doesn t spill a drop however if you re trying to dump the water out really fast like into a large pot slow down or you ll get a trickle down the sides because the spout won t handle the volume there s a fine mesh filter across the spout to catch any scaling if it ever occurs not seen it yet but i have an undersink filter and i remove that to stick a thermometer to catch it short of boiling would have been nice to get something where i could simply set the temperature rather than monitor the kettle but that would be a different product altogether the lid is nice opens gently i wondered whether i could heat vegetable stock in it but i think that better be left to the or that you see on good eats the electric hot pot that looks like a kettle but with perfectly vertical sides this has a tube in it and its shape won t lend well to thorough cleaning i ll stick to water it feels like it sits loose on the base but that s what makes it easy to pick up and put down the base doesn t get lifted with the kettle so it s nice in that the cord is solid and has a three pronged plug at the end all in all it feels solid and can do what it s supposed to do i fault it a star for trickling when i try to pour the water very quickly and for the odd placing of the level indicator the difficulty of being able to reach in and deep clean anything i d probably give it stars if that was possible 
suck up the wetness light and non cotton these are like spounges and they work far better than any dish towel i ve used previously i haven t washed these but if there s a problem i ll update 
very cool just what i expected very cool look and well made great turnaround shipping time from seller would highly recommend 
beautiful the dishes by sango the novas and these are simply stunning the pictures do not do them justice they also will blend with many other dish patterns which is why i chose these thanks amazon for a great selectio 
awesome multi use pan i wasn t sure what to expect from this pan but it s outshined everything i d anticipated based on the price i got it for less than ten bucks from the friday sale and i ve already used it at least ten times it s great for frying i made fried chicken a couple of times and it came out perfectly no hot spots i ve used it to make spaghetti sauce french toast taco meat chili and mexican shredded chicken for chicken nachos it s heavy enough to feel sturdy in your hand and they re a snap to clean even with the mexican chicken you have to cook that down for a couple of hours i haven t had any problems with sticking or scratching and it actually inspires me to cook you won t be disappointed by purchasing this pan ! it s great for the cook that uses a lot of different techniques or methods of cooking soups frying steaming 
impressive these little cutting boards are excellent ordered more after finding the first one so useful we love the fact that they solve the dripping issue and make excellent casual serving trays not bulky easy cleaning and storage what more can you ask for 
great but not for soft cereals i love this item it looks great in my kitchen very sturdy ! my only complaint is even though the rubber that turns inside to move the food is very soft it will still make a mess of cereals such as apple jacks looks awesome with coffee beans though 
very very nice this is the piece i was dying to try and i m not one bit sorry i got it being cast it cooked a great paprikash evenly although it extends beyond the burner quite a bit there was no real hotspot which there won t be if you follow use instructions for heat i love the way it goes into the oven right from the stovetop i d read some questions in a forum about a sticking problem and the recommendation was to heat the piece thoroughly before putting in the food then to keep the flame lower and let the natural characteristics of the pot do the work it worked like a charm ! easy cleaning even with a long cook time no burned garlic and onions in the saute either this is a wonderful piece 
outta this world biggest damn spice rack i ve ever seen ! no kidding this thing is huge 
great for the office this is a wonderful inexpensive little space heater that functions perfectly for my needs overairconditioned office it s unfortunate that this item has received so many poor reviews but i feel that s mainly the result of operator error the timer function seems to be stumping quite a few people if you purchase this heater and have trouble after reading the enclosed instructions simply read the review things you should know before buying from november everything is explained very clearly 
brilliant this knife tray is a brilliant concept we happen to have more drawer space than needed so to have a knife block that safely stores our steak santoku knives in a drawer fit our needs perfectly it solved the problem of having extraneous stuff on the counter while also solving the problem of having mismatched knives openly in a knife block on the counter i read the reviews before i purchased it and noted comments about the knife block not accommodating some knives we have henckel knives but not steak knives which are some other brand the steak knives fit perfectly in the allotted slots my only complaint is that there aren t enough steak knife slots 
great spice rack after reading such great reviews i decided to purchase this spice rack and i have not been disappointed it is very attractive sleek and modern i also found that some of my standard shaker tops fit the bottles ! this is great because some of my mixed spices are too large to fit the standard shaker top that comes with the bottles i am very pleased if you need a spice rack this is the one 
great product great price i have several brands of silicone baking mats and these are just as good as the ones costing twice as much highly recommended 
nice product the three bowls are nice but on the heavy side due to the fact that they are stoneware i failed to read that part and thought they would be lighter in weight they are just as described and will be a nice little gift for my cousin who has a black and white kitchen 
a good knife but not a great one this was a difficult knife to rate because on the one hand it is a very nice knife and on the other i can t recommend that you buy one this is a beautiful knife i don t prep with it but it has a permanent place on my magnetic strip because i just like looking at it if you want a damascus pattern japanese knife that looks pretty this is a good choice you must also look at the hattori hd different damascus style black western style handle with visible rivets and the a g russell damascus better damascus pattern with white eastern handles and visible rivets they are harder to find but nothing a quick google won t fix do not buy this knife unless you have held it and preferably used it this is true of any knife handle comfort and balance are extremely personal issues my love affair with this knife ended as soon as i took it out of the box i m a right hander with large hands and i use a pinch grip i like my knife balanced exactly on my working fingers with its curved offset bolster and ridged handle it s specially designed for a right hander with small hands using a pinch grip and even then it s mediocre using that grip the balance is cm nose heavy my forschner fibrox embarrasses this knife in term of handle comfort and balance the only shun knife with a real handle is the ken onion custom this knife is razor sharp out of the box but really any good knife will take a degree edge you just have to be willing to put it on yourself or find a pro you can trust to do it for you my wusthof grand prix has a degree edge and is as sharp as this knife and gives me at least hours on the board before i need to touch it up with my sharpmaker the same goes for my forschner vg is better steel but you will still need to hone it with a sharpening steel and it will still go dull on you it s only harder than the average good knife and the vanadium helps but isn t going to change your life if you just want a light knife with a thin spine you can get the same thing for a quarter the money from a forschner or some other industrial f dick pro dynamic or messermeister four seasons etc if you want a light razor sharp japanese knife with a hard blade you can get the same blade performance and a better handle for half the money from a tojiro dp if you re in the market for a japanese knife and want a complete set of eastern and western shapes your only real options are the shun or the globals i d rather have a hattori but they don t make a bread knife or a western boning knife or a chinese cleaver or a paring knife although the petty knives will do most of the same jobs but unless you re really attached to the idea of a matching set buy this knife and the paring knife and go industrial on the rest a forschner boning knife will spank the shun boning knife the same goes for the bread knife all pimpery aside if you ask alton brown he ll tell you that a bread knife is a waste of money but he ll still be more than happy to sell you one the shun sharpening steel is too short for this knife find a nice sharpening steel or buy a fine ceramic steel the ceramic steel will take off metal so if you don t really know how to use a steel stick with metal it s more forgiving of bad form all that said this is a good knife the edge is flawless the steel is good it s pretty it has a nice blade shape and the price is reasonable if you like the hand feel and don t have any trouble paying the mortgage it will be money well spent but i still prep with my forschner and leave the shun on the strip next to the global and the wusthof to impress any foodies that happen to wander through my kitchen and as a silent testament to brown bourdain and my dream that rachel ray will someday learn how to use a real knife 
chantal ounce tea steep i love this tea pot it s sturdy colorful and just the right size 
wonderfull accent fiestaware trivet i love the color and design of this trivet i use it as a spoon rest and for hot casserole dishes it is dishwasher safe and find it comes out clean and the color stays sharp a perfect addition for fiestaware enthusiasts to add to your collection i would definitely get another one in a different color when they are available 
emma the chocolate lab can t play with this enough can a retriever have too much fun with a toy 
better than five stars update i can say now that i have no regrets this knife is actually my favorite knife and the one i reach for first i have to force myself to use my chef s knife my shuns are still sharp i believe if you re serious about cooking you should own great cookware and excellent knives i finally stepped up and got excellent knives for those who haven t heard the hype shun is one of the most respected knife brands in the world great features of the entire line include these cool d shaped handles that fit your hand better each knife is made in a right and left handed version the handles are made of wood and are specially treated so they are diswasher safe the steel used for the blades is harder than what you would find in most other knives the knives are extremely sharp one thing to note about asian knives is that they must be sharpened at a different angle degrees vs degrees for german knives the shun steel takes the guesswork out of getting the angle correct because of the flat edge on one side of the metal disc below the handle about the scalloped santoku this is my first shun knife it is honestly the sharpest knife i have ever used i minced onion with relatively no effort i didn t feel any resistance while cutting and the job went amazingly quickly i have small hands and this knife felt perfect the weight was just right and it just fit well in my hand i will have to make adjustments to my grip as i get used to the knife i used the traditional grip you would use on a german blade chef s knife my hand slipped toward the blade this knife will not replace my chef s knife but it will see a lot of action this is an expensive but lifetime investment i encourage you to visit stores and feel the knives in your hand to make sure you are comfortable with them for more info on shun check out alton brown s website for ratings on various brands and types of knives this is probably the best kitchen purchase i ve made and the one i m most proud of i can t wait until the rest of the set arrives 
brita water filter i have previously used the brita water container but the on tap water filter system is wonderfully easy to use ! no more awkard handling of a big water pitcher i also enjoy the ability to switch between unfiltered and filtered water it is small in size and not too bad to look at 
norpro butter keeper i really like my butter keeper it does exactly what it was advertised to do 
doubted it seriously i doubted this knife would live up to my expectations i first got it and thought it maybe wasn t sharp enough i ve never used ceramic knives before and now i ve used it a couple times i will never buy any other kind again i am sold on ceramic knives i don t know how durable it is but i put it back into it s box after hand washing it just to be careful because it cuts like a dream i ve cut chicken breast green onions bell peppers steak pork carrots broccoli all sorts of stuff just to try it out through meats veggies and fruits i put it on the chicken breast at one end and pulled it right through in one clean cut i cam straight down on the green onions just to make sure i move it a smidge anyways to cut through seriously i won t use those metal knives i got for my wedding gifts or christmas gifts any more it s ceramic all the way for me i also nearly cut through my finger nail but luckily was fast enough to stop but i have a chip on the top of my nail now so carefull 
milling grains this is an excellent product and it makes wonderful flours from whole grains we make fresh whole grain breads pancakes and other foods with this mill it is noisy and a bit messy but it is worth every penny i wish it were built with stainless steel rather than plastic i am concerned about durability but so far it seems to hold up very well freshly ground flours are so much healthier for you than store bought that have a limited shelflife if you want your family to eat healthy i highly recommend this product 
best i ever spent my kitties are years old and i wish i had discovered this years ago they absolutely love it ! for almost an hour they were trying to catch it and i only stopped because i got tired i would highly recommend this to any cat owner 
handy items for canning i wish i had had these things last year the magnetic stick saves much time and unnecessary hot water burns trying to fish lids out of boiling water thanks 
super quick machine works great i am a pastry chef at a small restaurant and just spent countless hours over the holiday season making sorbets and gelatos in my home sized pint lello gelato maker which i recommend but this makes gallon of in minutes depending on the product desired the upside works well for both soft serve frozen drinks and gelato ice cream it s easy to clean it s made in the us and it s fast the downside it s huge i thought the ups man was delivering a toyota when it showed up it s loud really really load makes the washing machine sound like the toaster all in all i am very pleased amazon s price was great less than kitchenaide is selling them on ebay and the shipping was fast overnight and free 
cdn proaccurate digital programmable probe thermometer after much research into these devices i decided to purchase the cdn brand for my husband as a gift i chose this brand since it had a higher temperature range than that of the other brands available this one goes up to degrees so far he seems to love this thermometer it seems very accurate in reading the internal temp of the meats he loves that it allows him to program what type of meat and for beef the taste raremraremedwell the cable connecting the device to the probe seems to be pretty strong braided wire i have seen other devices by other brands that the cables burn out this was one of the deciding factors in purchasing the cdn brand my husband loves the magnetic feature that allows him to stick it to the side of the oven ! i am also excited to see the thermometer comes with a clip for candy making and frying i havent had a chance to use it for this purpose yet but it makes the device much more versatile useful the temperature display is quite large and easy to read so it will work good for someone who cant read small print i would actually give this product stars the only reasons i would deduct half a star are the casing is plastic cannot use on bbq and the timer beeper isnt that loud you cant hear it if upstairs or more than a room away so you need to stay in earshot to hear the timer go off all in all its a great product i would recommend it buy it and you will never have dried out or undercooked meat again its well worth it ! the chef in your life will thank you 
elegant and sturdy i must admit that i always thought that people who decanted their wines were just a little bit over the top a friend of mine told me that he could take a relatively cheap or new wine and make it taste better by pouring the wine into a decanter through a wine strainer by increasing the wine s exposure to oxygen it reduced the tannic taste some wines have when poured immediately from the bottle proving the old let it breathe adage he won me over after we hammered down a couple of bottle of wine his way i purchased this along with the liter version as a gift for another friend 
calphalon simply skillet this is the best skillet we have ever used for high heat usage it conducts heat evenly in all areas is heavy substantal fry pan similar to cast iron without the downside rusting sticking etc even though it is not advertised as non stick we have had no problem with sticking without the problems of tefelon scratching and flakes coming off the surface during high heat use we plan to replace other pans with calphalon in the future if this one continues to provide the service indicated review based on month of hard usage 
getting salty in my kitchen product just as promised looks great works wonderful a very happy purchase from my en 
replacement filter this was hard to find at stores and easy to get at amazon thank 
outstanding exactly as pictured looks great pumps work flawlessly i put hand soap in one and dish soap in the other i have used it for about a year now without problems 
the perfect coffee canister finding a decent coffee canister is not all that easy it should be in my opinion airtight non seethru a decent size to hold a pound of beans for example and look like it s intended for coffee this one fits the bill perfectly it s also very well made and the included scoop is both cute and original and in my experience at least shipping was quite fast 
replacement our old melitta broke one day we use it to make tea each morning we tried three stores in our area and could not find another one similiar to the one that broke amazon com had the exact set the melitta coffee pots are good products at a very reasonable price and of course are quite versatile 
i love this little salt server when i was looking i found it hard to find something that was small and attractive most are way too large for my kitchen and my needs this one looks great and holds just a small amount of my course sea salt it is perfect 
must have for wood and tile floors when we purchased our dyson i read about this tool in some of the reviews and decided to purchase the factory reconditioned unit and use the money we saved to get this accesory this was a great choice we love the vacuum and this tool does an outstanding job on our wood and tile floors i think it does a great job on steps also it has greatly expanded the functionality of the basic dyson and is well worth the extra cost 
translucent pot holder very satisfying purchase the product is of high quality and has all the most functional features it is comfortable and flexible and cool to the touch i am very happy with this purchase the inventing mind was right on the dot thank you 
fast and convenient cooking i bought this grill to make lefse but so far i have only used it for tortillas and pancakes it works wonderfully and cooks pancakes or tortillas at a time i can cook them in less than half the time it took using a skillet on the stove it has been easy to clean too now i all i need to do is find the time to make lefse 
great pizza stone for an inexpensive pizza stone it does the job if you re looking for something that is more versatile look somewhere else this stone is primarily for breads pizza and the like i know this because i tried baking cookies on it the cookies turned out fine but they stuck to the stone however when i make home made pizza from scratch the crust comes out perfect ! not too soft not too crisp it bakes it perfectly all the way through with a nice golden crust 
simple and hard worker very good snow maker it works perfectly and easy to use and clean just if i could desire something else to this perfect machine maybe a v converter would be very useful to be used anywhere in the world excellent purchase thanks amazon 
make bacon in your microwave i ve used one of these for years it is so easy and the fat winds up in the tray eliminating much of the unhealthy aspect of eating bacon you can make up to eight pieces at a time or you can remove one or two t s and hang only a couple of strips if you like i remove it after two minutes and pull the bacon apart if the ends are sticking together it can also be repositioned if the slices are not cooking uniformly then i return it to the oven and cook a minute or two more depending on how many strips are on the t s and how crisp i want it to be i wrap the finished bacon in a paper towel while my eggs are frying the mak n bacon washes easily unlike one of those microwave bacon trays with the ridges 
beautiful they are bigger than what i d consider ice cream bowls but thats perfect for me they came in perfect condition and are absolutely lovely 
this is a cast iron skillet as a ceramic cooktop owner who loves cast iron i had to invest in some enameled cast iron unenameled cast iron may scratch the surface i chose le creuset i enjoy cooking with all the le creuset skillets and pots that i own i have noticed some comments here that compelled me to write this review the black seen in the pan is not teflon but black cast iron cast iron skillets come either seasoned or unseasoned i have ones that stick worse than others i can t explain it but if the surface looks dull and gray as opposed to shiny and black it probably needs to some grease added to it i usually just spray with cooking oil prior to cooking for easier cleanup i m just guessing directions for that may be found on the lodge cast iron website lodge now offers an enameled cast iron line as does nordic ware but le creuset seems to be on sale more often and offered in more places also to avoid cracking the porcelain enamel follow the manufacturer s instructions about allowing the pan to cook down to room temperature extreme temperature changes may crack the glaze i will say these are really heavy pans and i have had to strategize on which shelves they can go 
great value these are great mugs for the price they don t leak are a great size fit snuggly in my car s cupholder and keep my coffee warm not piping hot but a drinkable temp for several hours sure the handles are a little weak and there are plenty of better constructed mugs out there but i don t think you are going to find them close to this price 
not an expert on espresso machines but i am a coffee connoisseur this is the first espresso machine i ve purchased did a lot of research and was not willing to fork out the for the higher rated machines then again i don t buy the higher rated european espresso blends either because you can get a much higher grade of coffee aribica grade beans domestically for a lot less money ive never had a better espresso on any other machine and the machine works flawlessly zero learning curve can start to brew as soon as you run a few cleaning trial runs i sip nothing but espresso cappuccinos now can t go wrong for the money and amazon had the lowest price 
this is the way cast iron was meant to be yeah i tried seasoning a cast iron frying pan never washed it just scrubbed it out with salt it was much more work than any other gadget i have and it wasn t worth it this is the perfect solution the frying pan is perfect for searing rib eyes or filets and then popping them in the oven to roast which gives you a far better result than broiling them the nonstick interior cleans up with paper towels and water and you don t need to put it in the dishwasher which is forbidden anyway the pan is so heavy that when you preheat it to sear you are able to completely sear a couple of steaks at a time it s so heavy you could stop a whole band of coyotes with this thing no matter what they d purchased from the acme corporation it works very well with an induction cooking top too the handle is bare porcelain enamel and it gets warm so consider buying a silicone handle cover especially if you have a gas range last but not least it has spouts for pouring off deglazing liquids to make those great reduction sauces 
it s ok what can i say it s sturdy handy and useful it does what a kennel is supposed to do 
classy and beautiful the set is so beautiful ! it is the perfect color and style for our new house ! we love how it is simple and still classy enough for formal dining ! i love this and it s a great deal ! i would recommend this set to anyone ! it s perfect 
great for fruits this item is great for high acid foods fruits but as a beginner i wasn t aware that you can t use it to put up meats or most veggies you have to use a pressure cooker style canner to do them according to the ball cook book that came with it i ve made a couple cases of fig preserves strawberry preserves and canned tomatoes very easy to use the cook book has several recipes that i plan on using 
mission folding bookcase this bookcase was fast and easy to set up and it fits perfectly in the small space i have for it the one thing i would change would be to put more slats across the back of it to prevent small items from falling off the back edges of the shelves but that s not a problem if you actually put books on this bookcase 
great use for our son s room we purchased this heater back in october for our now month old son s room to help take the chill off the air at night when he s sleeping we picked this one because it was silent no fan and had a temperature control with an on off switch it works quite well even with the door slightly ajar at night after months of use the heater is starting to make little creaking noises but is still working fine the only down side to this heater is the metal surface gets really hot so we will have to be careful once he starts crawling and walking 
georgetown black console table i was very pleased with this table my daughter purchased all three pieces in this collection and from the packaging to the product stability we are very pleased 
not a vornado but gets the job done this fan is neither as powerful nor as quiet as the vornado fan it tries to imitate but compared to some of the other fans on the market today the honeywell mega turbo is pretty darn good it moves an impressive amount of air is solidly constructed and comes with a reassuring year warranty update i just discovered that this fan cannot be taken apart for cleaning i would change the rating to two stars if i could 
really nice pizza cutter this cutter is good and heavy cuts cleanly without dragging and washes easily in the dishwasher 
love my sheets i was very pleased with my new sheets they were exactly as advertised and are so soft don t need ironing either you gotta love that ! 
outstanding just what i wanted and i need another set ty fred lundbor 
very pleased i read the reviews here before i purchased this and they were right on i placed this under a x in my living room which sees a lot of foot traffic this was an area rug on berber carpet before this the rug moved constantly and we were always pulling it back to where it should have been since placing this we may only make a slight adjustment every now and then so the product is well worth it footnote i now have a thick pile nylon carpet and it moves even less 
it s worth every penny if you love crepes and enjoy making all kinds of recipes with them you absolutely should invest in this pan i say invest because it s pricey but all clad is worth every penny i m slowly upgrading all my cookware to all clad and i m very pleased with everything i must say that delicate crepes are hard to make because the paper thin crepe is hard to flip always adding tons of butter or crisco to the pan each time you pour the crepe batter adds too many additional calories the non stick surface on this pan is the best i ve ever used and you can use this pan for any number of recipes besides crepes i m very very pleased and satisfied with my purchase 
a must have these are easy to use they do not make a mess and offer vibrant colors they do not taint what you are decorting as some colors can i would highly recommend these to anyone to likes to decorate 
just as expected this was delivered promptly packaged well and looked exactly as i expected it to the only downfall was that one of the beads was broken during shipping but for my purposes it worked well i suppose if i had been using it as a curtain i would not have been pleased that there was a broken bead however it was just what i wanted 
just beautiful dinnerware the color detail and quality of this set is just perfect i love it and have receieve many compliments on it i intend to purchase another set very happy with set and the manner it was packed and shipped 
the best pillow ever really this pillow is perfect in every way i have had neck pain so long i lost track i found this on amazon ordered and what a great idea if you have any type of neck pain you need this pillow 
good quality this is a very nice cotton balnket and i have been very pleased with it 
customer satisfaction my order was delivered to my house within a few days and it was the xmas rush ! i have always wanted some lecreuset cookware and i was able to purchase it on sale and there was no tax and shipping and handling ! i was thrilled i plan to purchase more pieces and i have been using it regularly since xmas the product is great and amazon com was great ! 
purchased on july i loved this can opener for the small cost i paid years ago it was worth it ! after having about months my daughter dropped it and it still worked wonderfully always left it plugged it for recharging the only problem that occured was every once in a while the cutting blade would get pushed into the unit and i would have to take a butter knife to get it back out sad to say the rechargeable batteries just dies and now i am looking to purchase a second one ! 
black spoon rest very nice product and resonable any negative very small would be the steepness of the angle not flat very nice however 
great vacuum ! great price i have had oreck vacuums in the past years i liked them because they were light weight i thought they were doing a good job i m not sure why i felt the need for another vacuum maybe because the carpets still didn t look that great after i cleaned but i began researching upright vacuums and finally settled on this bissell total floors bagless which cost half of what i paid for each of the oreck s it arrived last week i was totally amazed by the amount of dirt and pet hair that it picked up only a day after using the oreck i have one pet a short haired cat and no children so my house should not have gotten that dirty in one day ! it had to be the vacuum i also love the little turbo brush for cleaning the upholstery does a great job ! i m so pleased that i decided to buy it it is quite a bit heavier that the oreck but other than that it s far superior in my opinion 
mypod for senseo this is really great it makes only a single cup but of any kind of coffee you can get it at your local walmart without paying shipping ! if you have a senseo coffee maker it is a must hav 
nice looking and useful came on time and in great condition i use a lot of european recepies so i stumble on a lot of metric measurements so i am happy to know that this scale provides weight in grams kiloslbsoz very useful to me as i cook a lot from scratch 
great invention it does leave the egg a little soggy but all you have to do is drain the water off before putting on your sandwich the only other problem i jhave with it is that the egg sticks the the pan its in even pam dosen t help much the sadwiches are delicious and it only takes about min or less i highly recommend the product 
kone cordless hand vac blue great handy little device very pleased with the way it works on cleaning up small jobs 
a nice set lids are fairly tight and they re nice and heavy i liked them alot and i think they re good for the sale price i paid the lids were very tight fitting which was a suprise it was almost too tight on the pan but it does work out okay the handles are definitely plastic so if you re looking for a nice rubber handle this isn t for you overall a quality set for a pretty good price this set isn t for experienced chefs however 
good for the price pros works well heats fast auto shutoff feature and visible water level are nice cons putting kettle on base requires lining up slots which takes a little extra care and might result in damage to contacts if you re not careful 
better than other sticker adhesive removers un du is a much better product than the other similar type adhesive removers googone goof off etc because it is safe for plastic those other products will dull or dissolve plastic such as the plastic used to make cd jewel cases un du does the job without causing damage i suspect that like me the surface that often needs adhesive removed is plastic so this is the only product to have 
nice but too low i have never owned a memory foam pillow before so i don t know if it s a regular sizes for all of them but i found it to be very low i have a wide shoulders and the pillow didn t support my head very well my guess is that it s probably better to get some of the other ones heavier like or lbs they might be a little bit bigger the foam feels very soft and comfortable though 
the best pillow ever really this pillow is perfect in every way i have had neck pain so long i lost track i found this on amazon ordered and what a great idea if you have any type of neck pain you need this pillow 
great value color was very close to that of the picture and worked perfectly unit is slightly oversized but has not been washed yet soft seems to be durable terrific pric 
great countertop water system we used the britta system for almost years to filter our nasty tasting local water we were becoming dissatisfied with the floating carbon particles with each filter change and found that the filters were not taking out all of the bad taste we decided to give the pur countertop system a try about the same price as britta to set up and were amazed at the better quality of filtered water ! the taste is great and no more carbon floaters from the filters the only complaint would be that these filters are harder to find and more expensive than britta the extra cost is worth it 
a bit too big but excellent quality i purchased two of these hampers for my daughters age and i have had them for a few months now and so far there is no damage to them ! they are a bit too big for my daughters to carry down the stairs to our laundry room so i have them empty them when they are about half full and that works just fine they are very cute and the quality is excellent 
versatile and sturdy when these arrived years ago i was disappointed because they are too wide to keep coffee tea warm for very long but lately i have noticed i use them almost every day for things like cereal soup and even edamame i use these more than the gusto bowls because they are easy to manage and offer a more modest portion size they re not for coffee but you ll find dozens of other uses for these jumbo mugs 
bar bchef review by poebaitfly the grill is a significant improvement over my previous weber in regards to grill area regidity of the cast iron grill control for raising or lowering goals large charcoal shelf three compartments within the charcoal shelf heavy guage metal construction the option of adding a rotisseriethe grill is wanting in regards to lack of an enamel coating on the cast iron grill lack of closable upper and lower vents which would enable greater temperature control and the ability to seal the grill interior when finished in order to snuff out the coals 
antique styling modern durability this trivet is wonderful virtually indestructible and it s absolutely beautiful too ! my friend from brittany said her grandmother had the same exact trivet when she was a child i am sure this one will last me a very long time 
amazing vacuum i like to clean i don t like a lot of noise this vacuum cleans beautifully when it s not even on full power i have bare floors and rugs it handles both with ease i did purchase the brush head for rugs although i m not sure i needed to however i am happy i did since i like a thorough clean i ve used shop vacs in the past more inexpensive run of the mill vacs and for tough construction jobs i d use a shop vac only beacause i wouldn t want to ruin the miele the miele is very powerful however and very quiet we have a month old and she is soothed when i use it you can t beat the design as well it s really pretty anyhoo i read some review where the person was upset they had to buy the brush extension for their rugs well i m glad i did and i don t see myself getting another vacuum for years which will end up in an overall savings 
i give it stars for its handiness i have not had a chance to use my cereal dispenser but i do look forward to using it i too was not very satisfied with the color i was expecting a white dispenser which would have matched my kitchen appliances and i got the creamish off white dispenser i learned a few techniques from the other reviews on how to use the dispenser to avoid crushing my cereal i will check back at a later date and rate how my family and i like it i definitely love the idea of not using cereal boxes and having to worry about if my husband or son will close the sack appropriately so the cereal will remain fresh that was a definitely plus for me i guess i will see how things go ! 
forget the foot switch it has a timer i got this for my old sf apartment where i have no heat in the bathroom and the room gets terribly cold on winter mornings this unit has a hour timer so you can set it to turn on at regular times every day so the heater turns on minutes before my alarm goes off and i don t scream when my feet hit the bathroom tile anymore ! i love it ! if you use the timer funtion you never have to use the foot pedal switch which is a bit stubborn the heat plus fan is also a real plus you don t end up with one really hot area in the room and the rest of it freezing cold the best possible unit particularly for bathroom and kitchen use safe in both rooms 
copper or stainless steel cleaner i have used this for years on my revere pans it works great makes the pans look like new 
sharp knives takes practice i ve owned one for five years and my knives are razor sharp it took me a little practice before i realized i was using it correctly though the directions could be better and the machine doesn t provide any feedback to distinguish proper sharpening cooks illustrated magazine found that they could get knives sharper with this device than with the higher end models 
nesco american harvest jerky spice original flavor this is the best jerky spice on the market as far as my family is concerned when our store quit carrying it we started buying it through amazon com there is no other spice like it we did try others but they could not compare to nesco american harvest 
great bowls these bowls have been in my home for a few years now we have used them for cereal in the morning for warming up food in the microwave they are nice looking and very functional when we needed another bowl when one broke we knew we would get another fiestaware bowl 
excellent quality for the money i bought this cake dome at least years ago and am still using it today it is very sturdy and the glass quality is pretty good especially considering the price i paid something like at the time which is an incredible deal 
a cool splurge these are just nice nice quality great design decent price they are easy to clean easy to use easy to hang easy to like get them along with a set of the michael graves cups and while your cooking may still suck you ll at least be doing it in style 
i love it i really like this product the time it takes to make homemade french fries is cut more than half i have also used it for veggie and cheese platters well worth the price ! and easy to clean 
good solid product this is my first food processor and overall i m very satisfied with it the mini bowl is very useful for making small quantities of pesto sauce etc the processor runs quietly and efficiently the only negative i found was that it can be a pain to clean 
realllly convenient i ve had a couple of these divided containers for years now unlike some tupperware products you can t just throw this in a tote bag and expect it to not leak at all if it goes somewhat vertical but that said for the price it s great love the fact that it s entirely see through perfect for taking leftovers for lunch to work 
beautiful these knives are so beautiful and sharp although a bit expensive the quality is stunning i purchased my set w a free cutting board value and and free shipping at etronics com for i regret i did not purchase the piece set for this is one purchase you won t regret 
oops bleach apparently does not ruin these as i found out this week when i was washing other sheets and this happened to get mixed up in a white sheet instead my haze sham turned the most beautiful pink that is ok but now i have to order additional shams so if you want to redecorate for spring you can always bleach the haze color these do take slightly longer to dry and i ended up putting them back in the dryer for a few minutes even when the dryer cycle was complete that is if you dry them along withthe duvet or sheets the softness of this product takes you to new levels of comforting warmth the preshrunk cotton has been brushed to maximum softness the quality seems superior for the price the wamsutta flannel is velvety and brushed on both sides for comfort the rebecca revie 
so much better than wood this is definately a good cutting board i owned a nasty old wood one for years this plastic one is so much more durable and easy to clean 
did i get the only one of these that works i love my oil mister sprayer thingy pour the oil in pump the cap about times and a fine mist comes out no it s not a lot of oil that comes out each spray but enough to coat a inch frypan to grill quesadillas or grilled cheese sandwiches on i used to use butter for this task but no more its absolutely perfect for coating your pan in an instance where you would use butter or pam cooking spray no it s not going to get a whole cookie sheet in one spraying but i think its well worth the extra pump 
excellent microwave i m used to industrial microwaves the ones used in resturants this one out performs those at allmost all tasks the only place where it only matches their performance is with large frozen meals i will definitly recomend this microwav 
don t burn the macaroni i purchased this pot in january and have used it several times a week since i love the pot for sauces and other stove top applications it has worked tremedously on my ceramic stove top grrr hate the ceramic wish it was gas but that is a different review the pot has been easy to clean and the finish has held up very well and i looked forward to years of use until i boiled the pot dry with my macaroni noodles the noodles seemed to have bonded in a blackened brotherhood to the bottom of the pot and no amount of soaking scrubbing cleaning can seem to coax them to separate again because this little incident had more to do with being the mother of a teething month old and had very little to do with the pot i will definatly be purchasing another pot overall this is a great purchase at an unbelievable price so for cooks hoping to take their dishes up a notch i would totally reccomend it just don t leave it on the stove with noodles and no water for over minutes 
great item this is exactly the replacement part i wanted it s a great way to froth milk 
great transaction smooth transaction ! i got my order very quickly ! i would buy from again 
gourmet knives are stamped blades in reading the comments on these knives i noticed that there was a different type of metal in the gourmet vs the classic i checked my knives and then contacted a friend of mine that is into knives he said that molybdenum is put into the steel for forging purposes only thus it has no effect on the sharpness or finish because gourmet is a stamped knife it does not require this type of material i have the knives and they are great they are not the quality of the classic but they don t carry that price either 
great scissors at a great price this is a quality all around set for the home or office all the sizes and the pruning sheers are just right 
strong sturdy compact but lacking assembly instructions this is a wonderful piece it fits nicely in a small corner we ve placed ours in a small mudroom and it s perfect the piece is sturdy and solid no wobbling no loose hooks and it looks very sharp ! i would give it a full five stars but i ve only been using it for week so i can t yet say how it will hold up after long term use and i do have one major issue the product arrived without assembly instructions ! fortunately if you re assembly gifted and really you don t need to be that gifted you can assemble the stand without difficulty however you will need your own phillip s head not mentioned anywhere but that s something that everyone should have and a bit of know howthis may help when assembling the pole of course the piece with the holes will go on the top for the hooks the piece with the threaded hole goes on the bottom and i believe that both washers connect underneath with the screw to hold the pole in place that s what i did with mine and it s very sturdy when you place the feet on the umbrella stand assembly be certain not to tighten the allen wrench screws or you will not be able to place the phillip s head screws at the bottom of the feet to lock the feet in place when you add the hooks to the top assemblage do not tighten the allen screws beyond tight or you will strip the threading and your hook will be loose one other thing that would be helpful is a rubber mallet for knocking in the finial at the top and the small round covers on the hooks and the feet in reality these are the sorts of things that vision decor should tell you themselves but since they don t i hope this helps someone 
an essential for family of four or more this is a big saucepan ! i got it for christmas because i needed a large saucepan shape with a long handle to make pralines this has become my favorite pot for many things from cooking pasta to whipping up a large pot of chili on a cold night the see through lid is great for monitoring food as it s cooking and the second loop handle gives stability when carrying and pouring it is traditional calphalon quality with a modern look and i love it 
great i was looking for a crockpot that wasn t too large and wasn t too expensive this product fit the bill the lid is treated glass so you can see the food cooking without lifting the lid the lid handle stays cool during the cooking so you won t burn your fingers if you touch it the ceramic cooker is sturdy and alittle heavy it can become slippery when wet so be careful while washing it in the sink also be careful because the handles on the cooker and the metal base can become very hot during cooking so keep potholders nearby the cooker can accomodate a pound whole chicken and pound roasts it s oval shape enables these foods to fit well it comes with a small instruction manual that includes some recipes so far i ve cooked whole grain cereal barley and cracked wheat stews whole chickens corned beef and turkey legs they ve turned out good however since i m new to slow cooking the first attempts were abit off because i cooked the food too long but now i m better with the timing so the food is better just a side note if you like eating whole grain cereals the slow cooker is terrific you don t need to stand over a stove stirring the pot and worrying it will boil over this cooking method allows the grains to fully absorb the water which makes for a creamier end result plus you can toss the grains and water into the cooker at bedtime and it s done in time for your breakfast i do have a two very minor complaints the packaging the cooker is packaged in a way that you have to slide it out of the box if you aren t careful you could drop the ceramic cooker or the glass lid the handle to the lid was alittle loose and could be made tighter with turn but that might not be a design flaw but a way to compensate for the expansion of the glass during the cooking process so don t mess with it imo otherwise this is a great product 
macho cheese slicer this is a hefty kitchen tool large heavy chrome it fits comfortably in the hand and is easy to guide i m not sure why there are three thickness settings since i ve always been able to cut both thin and thick slices with a grocery storetype cheese slicer by simply changing the angle of my hand as i slice upright for thick slices flatter for thin ones this slicer works very well for me and i had no trouble removing and replacing the wire one slight inconvenience when i hand wash the slicer the roller the adjustable part of it always falls out and has to be put back in the slicer comes with a spare wire and if you can remember where you store it this unit should last for a long time i d recommend it 
corning creations cookware makes cooking enjoyable for me corning creations is the bomb no matter what you put in them no matter how baked on it comes right off you can soak it if you like for a couple of seconds but it is totally not necessary ! i m just unhappy that i cannot find them anywhere but here and kohls they even have a new line of funky colors according to the corningware site but who knows where they can be located i m telling you corning creations is the best thing they ever came up with and i just don t think a lot of people know how easy the clean up is they are nice and heavy too sort of like some type of stone or something do yourself a favor and just buy one piece to try it out but at the low prices you should just buy a set 
best knife i ve ever used i bought this knife for my daughter for her birthday i m sure she s going to enjoy using it i had the occasion to use it at her house after she unwrapped it and found it to be amazing it was so well balanced and weighted that when slicing a potato very little pressure had to be applied now i just have to get one for myself well my birthday is coming up in february 
great size quality and colors this plate is the perfect size for general use the colors are great the quality is amazing and they stand up well in the dishwasher and microwave plus they are made in the usa 
has worked very well for me i realize some other reviewers have had problems but i haven t this is my go to turner and it has held up very well strong enough for weighty items but thin enough to easily slip under pretty much anything the nylon has served me well with my non stick pans 
great cups for the kids guests anyone i originally purchased these tumblers for our kids to use i wanted something that was unbreakable for the kids but also something that would withstand the dishwasher our old kid cups cracked after two runs in the dishwasher they were cheapies from target these tumblers are great the smaller size in the set is ideal for little hands but my kids use the bigger ones as well they ve been dropped several times without breaking cracking however we did have one that was sitting full of water in the sink and someone dropped a heavy butter knife into the cup this created a small crack on the inside of the tumbler the crack does not go all the way through so we still use the tumbler overall these tumblers are great as an unbreakable option for kids we ve had friends over for dinner and sometimes they actually prefer to drink out of these versus our regular glass tumblers with their modern design they will work well out on the patio this summer as well ! my only word of caution is to not drop heavy silverware directly down into them kind of a no brainer there otherwise they will crack they look like glass from a distance and have a very substantial feel to them as well we initially ordered one set but after they arrived we ended up ordering another one ! they ve withstood the dishwasher and my kids i highly recommend these to everyone 
easiest to use as a server in an italian restaurant i have to open a plethora of wine bottles in front of customers based on experience with many different corkscrews this is by far the easiest to use it is one of the fastest and smoothest of any corkscrew i have experienced i have however seen it other places for much cheaper than here 
chef s choice m knife sharpener i cook all the dinners here at home and sharp knives are an asset in the kitchen a word of warning from the manufacturer is very true warning knives sharpened on the chef s choice will be sharper than you expect use them with great care i taped their warning to our knife rack as a reminder in short the manufacturer s instructions are very easy to follow and the knife sharpener is very easy to use as well it s a little pricey but if you want really sharp knives you won t be disappointed you can sharpen all your kitchen knives serrated knives and pocket knives too my knives are sharper than when i bought them good luck 
great deal on a great vacuum the dyson dc full kit out performed my oreck xl in ways i could not have imagined thanks to the transparent collection cup one can immediately see what has been collected i was stunned at what my oreck had left behind i highly recommend the dyson to anyone considering a new vacuum purchase i am as satisfied as one can be with my purchase of a remanufactured unit from amazon com 
shamrock rocks these mugs were gorgeous nice and big to fill up with cocoa after being out in the snow ! the color is beautiful a little darker than the retired chartreuse but they look wonderful with the cobalt sunflower plum amp turquoise i already have 
beautiful i can not begin to express how pleased i am with my new tray it arrived in perfect condition it s both beautiful and well made my husband s already requested breakfast inbed i can t wait to serve tea to my friends and family 
a real slow cooker unlike most of the other little crockpots this one is the real deal in miniature not a dip heater when i have to take a dish to a party i drag out the monster crockpot but for just the two of us this is perfect ! i can throw in a meal early in the day whenever i am not busy and it will be sitting there ready to eat when my husband rolls in that evening in his job it s hard to tell when he ll get home so i really appreciate crock pots no rushing around cooking at the end of a long day trying to put something on the table when you are ready to blob out on the sofa this one cooks a small meal and the removable little crock fits easily in the dishwasher or in the fridge if there are leftovers or for cook ahead items it does a great job on small quantities of dried beans too giving about the equivalent of a canful the first day and then coming back out of the fridge the next day for the chili i haven t tried pinhead oats overnight in this yet but that is something i will do since i love oatmeal and my husband hates it it ll make just enough for me this is exactly what i was hoping for crock pot convenience without the gallons of leftovers 
previous version has worked for years no mold i think some people are distorting reality on this product based on another problem in their refrigerator and blaming it on the brita i ve used the previous generation of this product in all different parts of the usa in various refrigerators and i ve never experienced mold i can t see why this design is fundamentally going to be different my guess is people have a mold problem in their house refrigerator and like any mold it is seeking the moisture clean your fridge i don t wash this once a week more like once a month the water doesn t pick up weird tastes or smells but then again my refrigerator is clean i find it convenient to use not so much to fill but it still works as intended the version currently for sale may have a leak problem i can t say yes or no but the one i have has not leaked in all the time i ve had it other then once when i determined the spigot needed to be tightened all in all if you are tired of filling up pitchers constantly and find the full pitcher heavy and spill prone when you use it this product is for you also because you don t have to tip it you can fill it with water and get a glass almost immediately even as the rest of the water is still filtering in a brita pitcher you must wait for all the water to filter before you can even have a glass this feature has come in handy when doing things like filling pet water bowls fish tanks etc id give it five stars but i find it a bit cumbersome to fill 
waterford bedding waterford makes top quality well styled bedding that lasts lasts we have several groups love them all great product 
very good item as advertised works well and the price is rigth what else does one want 
hard to clean le creuset cast iron products really conduct the heat and are great products to have in the kitchen one drawback they can be difficult to clean if you sear meat or fry burnt remnants cannot be removed overnight soaking will help but you cannot use soft scrub or hard scrubbers on the enamel the product still functions well it just does not look as nice as an expensive piece of cooking gear should be ! would buy it again 
cooks everything perfectly after being disappointed with ge and black and decker toaster ovens i spent a little more and got this cuisinart it is the best toaster oven hands down the light medium dark toaster settings really work i have little ones and make a lot of french fries and mozzerella sticks this toaster oven actually crisps them they don t come out cooked but mushy like they did in my other ones you can cook bagels at a time as well as small pizzas it it nicely oversized compared to others i have stainless steel appliances and this oven looks great out on the counter great product 
i love this machine i love it i love it i love it my mom let me use this machine and now i m the official ice cream maker in the house clean up is really easy even for a kid you just pour a quart of warm water in the funnel lid but make sure it is closed because this machine has an interlock feature that stops the machine from operating when the lid is not engaged just flip the mix switch and use the lever to drain out the soapy water i made vanilla ice cream from an episode i saw on good eats it was so smooth and you control the amount of overrun this is the only machine on the market that lets you do this light ice cream for the kids and sinfully rich ice cream for your parents store bought ice cream doesn t stand a chance against this machine try it youll love it ! 
perfect knife this is one fine knife prior to this my favorite knife was a gerber balance plus inch chefs knife i bought over years ago this is a much better knife the balance and grip feel is much more natural 
simply the best le creuset has one of the best reputations out there coming from professional chefs to the everyday at home chef le creuset has quality durability and beauty based on collected articles and other positive feedback i purchased my first piece ever from le creuset on another web site and i love it i agree with it all as a matter of fact it is this same oval platter that i purchased from another web site and when i wanted another one they were sold out amazon had it and i just had to purchase it it s a multi purpose serving platter that looks great on any table setting it s durable i ve banged it a few times quite by accident may i add and there is not even a scratch on it all le creuset products are expensive but very well worth it i see these platters lasting a very very long time 
absolutely wonderful being physically challenged with severe ra has made this cleaner indispensable for me ! i can t bend over to clean up spills messes so i keep this flip it right near my kitchen which has a bamboo floor and it always looks fabulous its lite weight makes it usable by someone with limited strength i love it initially it was a bit difficult to get used to i tried vacuuming with the wet side couldn t imagine why it was so hard to push duh i also had to learn that when washing the floor you need to release enough water to wet the pad at the start or else it is too difficult to push my bathrooms have ceramic tile floors and they have never looked so clean i always use the heater for tile i highly recommend this item 
so far so good as bedroom pop cooler i read all the reviews for this fridge and other like it this one seemed the best out of all the ones available however i m a little worried because some people said it breaks after months i got it as a present for my nephew who uses it solely to keep pop cool in his bedroom it seems to be working well for that i think the most important thing to remember is that it has to have air space around it for the fan to vent the warm air out 
best product for a quick dinner i have one for myself and bought this for a friend of mine he said it was the best birthday present he had ever received i use this every single day to mince garlic and onions so nice to not have to cry my way into dinner making grind up leftover meat for pasta sauce for that bolognese kind of meal it is the best no matter what the chefs on food network say about doing everything with excellent knife work some times you just need a helping hand 
effective training that won t hurt your pets i have two domestic long hair cats that love sleeping on the couch one of my cats has a bladder problem and my last couch lasted only a year and a half because of it ! when i bought my new couch i also bought the large scat mat to get some life out of my couch i was worried about the intensity of the shock of the scat mat but i kept the mat set to the lowest intensity my friends touched the mat just to ensure that it wasn t too intense it startles the cats but obviously doesn t hurt them i only had to use the mat for a week before my cats had learned to stay away from the couch in fact they don t go near the couch at all even though the mat only covers the seat cushions my cats don t even jump up on the back cushions or even scratch the arms 
good value if you are terrible at making rice as i am this is a very helpful product the liquid tends to boil over if cooked at high temp in my microwave i cook the rice at power for about longer than the directions recommend and it comes out perfectly easy clean up in the dishwasher it is a bit of a pain to store but i d buy it again also comes with a steamer insert for cooking vegetables etc but i haven t tried that yet 
chef works well since i was planning to spend a few days in a commercial kitchen and my henckels knives are both embarrassingly small for serious work and embarrassingly dull because i m too lame to sharpen them i decided to grab the chef s knife at bed bath beyond with a off coupon it worked extremely well for all the tasks i set it to today including mincing parsley and chiffonading mint as well as the usual cutting tasks despite its shallow curve i strongly prefer knives whose edges are mostly straight rather than the curved french style the blade rocked very well for mincing and was flat enough to cut completely through the rolled mint leaves in one short stroke furthermore the sharpness impressed the other people who used it though we shall have to see if it can be resharpened to the same degree the handle design is clearly not for everyone but i found it very comfortable when i held the knife as many cooks do with the back end of the blade pinched between thumb and forefinger s in particular most knife handles bolsters seem to be designed for people who grip knives solely by their handles but the integrated bolster made it feel right to grip knife at the blade the handle seems to be just the right weight to balance the blade but i ll reserve judgment on whether it actually is that well balanced until i ve spent more than a few hours using it im impressed enough with the chef that i m considering getting the block set which includes the chef and a paring knife i have no idea if the handle design will work well for that though as well as three other not entirelyuseless knives serrated utility santoku which probably would have been great for the chiffonade i must admit a chef is probably marginally more useful than a utility but it s nice to have at least one knife you re willing to hand to your less skilled friends it also has a diamond hone which will actually sharpen knives not just align their edges though i use a dmt diamond hone for sharpening i find this assortment considerably more useful than many others which include things like boning knives carvers and bread knives all of which are imo far too specialized to include in a basic knife kit especially for home cooks the only shortcoming of the block set is the inclusion of laughably dubious kitchen scissors i hope that calphalon will see fit to add to the line at least a chef and a santoku but most of the funkily ergonomic or just funky knife lines i ve looked at don t have those alas i have no idea if i ll continue to like this knife as it enters daily use i hope that amazon will let me revise my rating later if it turns out to be overly optimistic but based on this one afternoon s use and since they force me to rate it i ll give it five stars kiran ltentropyiocom 
excellent i have owned a cuisinart stock pot for several years and use it all the time one can not beat the sear that a stainless pot provides the new set is just as good i have been using the stainless more and more and the hard anodized that it replaces less and less there is a reason that the cooking show chefs all use stainless just remember to use a lower heat than you normally do since these pans seem to heat up faster and hotter 
one size wont fit all a fabulous wok by appearances but for us it has yet to be seasoned inasmuch as we are researching alternative wok rings for our gas cooktop a word of caution that may be obvious to some wok rings are not universally sized to fit recognizing that the one that came with the wok might not work we were prepared to search for one that would but were not prepared for how difficult that would be meanwhile the local chinese restaurant and my cast iron skillet are getting too much use the search goes on 
works well quiet this has helped very much and is quiet as well provides a therapy for our throats and makes waking up in the am much more enjoyable because our throats aren t dry good valu 
fantastic can opener years and going strong we re coming up on two years of steady use with this little jewel and very happy with it it takes a little practice at first learning the proper way to position it but i m able to do it with one hand no i m not hercules my wife also gives it stars and wants me to buy an extra one in case they discontinue it she s not very strong and has never had any problem puncturing the can to get it started it s very compact and comes apart easily to clean this is one of our favorite kitchen tools highly recommend 
purchased as a xmas gift extremely satisfied with this purchase even though it was purchased as a late xmas gift was ordered on and was told it would arrive on or after the rd week in january it arrived on not a bad deal when your order ships for free would recommend this product and site to all my friends and co workers 
great product the flexible chopping mats are great for preparing chopping and dicing fruits and veggies thank you 
two pans in one get both a springform pan great for making cheesecakes and also a more than serviceable bundt pan for angel food and pound cakes in the same package with nordic ware s great baking pan simply switch out the bottoms one the standard springform flat bottom and the other a springform insert to convert from one use to the other the pan is also non stick although normal oiling or flouring is recommended and easy to clean up and maintain for the price of a decent springform or bundt pan getting both in the same package is an exceptional value 
save your pennies like all of the coper core pieces from all clad this is a beauty i used to think people who spent so much on cookware were insane if you actually use this pan every day and you can and turn out consistently delightful meals and you will for every dish that turns out as you had hoped pop one penny in a jar you can find them everywhere if you look my kids do and by a years time cent a day you will have saved enough to go and get another of these delightful pans the flat cooking surface of this pan is actually just a tad larger than the braiser and the overall interior diameter and height of the domed lid is just a tad smaller imeasured side by side i got thick lamb chops into this pan seared em deglazed then added the magic ingredients popped in the oven with lid and braised delicious sautese higher sides makes good for frying chicken if you dobraiser probablly better for a larger quantity but even that might not be so because while the braisers sides flare out they are shorter the sautese sides go straight up and are higher all depends on what you are cooking i supposealso the sautese has a lip around the edge which helps in pouring without dripping lastly it is roughly lessmay all your meals be joyous ! 
nice product taller molds are more useful overall a serious foodie that has been perfecting her cooking skills for the last years in her home kitchen writes this review my favorite cookbooks are the professional chef by the culinary institute of america and culinary artistry if you love to make your food as beautiful as it is tasty you will enjoy this product i find these molds most useful for making risotto cakes making short vegetable stacks small frozen mousses or cutting rounds from cakes to serve as a bed for items like stacks you can pack the mold and then slide the ring up to make a taller stack however this stretching method will not work for a taller frozen mousse i imagine you could secure two molds together for a taller frozen mousse but since i have not tried that i am uncertain as to how well it would work the height restriction of inches makes these molds a little less useful than my set of molds that are inches tall this product is well made and should stand the test of time if you don t already own a taller set of molds i would suggest that you consider that purchase first i find them to be much more useful in my kitchen 
nice mop pads i purchased these to use with my steamfast mop they are machine washable and fit fine even after being thrown in the dryer perhaps the steamfast head is slightly smaller than the bissell i don t know about that but they fit well on it they are sturdy and well made 
the name fits this stuff is so awesome ! i wound up with quite the large puppy she was house broken but only if she had constant access to a yard we didn t needless to say she soiled everywhere i used puppy training pads to soak it up ironic once the liquid was absorbed into the pad i just sprayed this on the stain let it sit for about minutes gave it a quick wipe and stain and odor were gone ! i mean it there is no stain and no odor left anywhere you can t even tell where they were and there were alot it s an amazing product and works better than i ever expected 
great cookware really have enjoyed using this saucepan cooks evenly does not stick cleans up good thinking of purchasing more of this product 
watt microwave oven so far this product is working fine has plenty of power heats food in a flash very good quality for the price i paid for i 
i love this spatula won t melt nothing quite like a melted spatula you left in chocolate or caramel a bit too long this one won t melt it s very sturdy but be warned quotlargequot means large you can t stick it into a can of evaporated milk or tomato paste very well to scrape out the sides i d recommend buying both small and large trust me you ll love both 
choose your sweeper wisely this sweeper is exactly what one would expect for it does a fairly good job of picking up pieces of things though isn t a choice option for things like pet hair unless you really want a workout also it s best for smoother rug textures why do i own this my toddler is scared of the vacuum yet scatters cheerios liberally across the carpet this lets me get the worst of the mess while she s awake so less gets ground in also the handle comes in slide together sections we re currently using only sections so that my daughter can help as the mood hits so far so good ! i give this stars because like most things it works slightly less well than one might wish 
excellent for saving space i bought this power station because my husband and i had charging cords all over the place our phones and my pda were being charged in all ends of the house this thing is really great ! it keeps the cords neatly inside it only requires one electrical outlet and is also a handy little holder for the items charging most everyone who has seen it at work at our house has been equally impressed with it i highly recommend it for the organizationally challenged everything you need to charge will be in one place and ready to go 
fridge into wine not bad this bottle rack set is a little tricky to put together but can turn those empty refrigerator shelves into wine storage make em as high or as wide as you want a good deal given the price 
good product but i prefer joint max ds i used this product for years for my big boy terrence an lb boxer who was diagnosed with hip dysplasia about years ago it worked well but then i put him on joint max ds when one of my friends told me about it i ve been using joint max for a year now and it s really made a big difference terrence s mobility has improved a lot more than when he was on cosequin plus joint max is less expensive 
perfect every time the product is as sdvertized and is very simple to use i am not a coffee connisseur but i do enjoy a good espresso it has never been bitter or burned i am very pleased with this product 
great product but be aware where you buy i find myself somewhat in a dilemma as i am writing this review to avoid any confusion let me start out by saying that this grater is quite good as with all graters there are problems with certain products generally those that are very soft a fresh gouda might clog up the grater whereas a medium ripe gouda will be grated without any problems personally i use this grater only on parmesan and for this purpose it simply cannot be beat installed on a wall the grater sits snugly in a cradle while it is being charged making at always ready when you need it if you like i use large amounts of certain cheeses or perhaps chocolates in your cooking this grater will make your life tremendously easier one thing to consider though is that the rechargable batteries just like all such batteries have a limited life my first grater stopped working after about four years but frankly by then i had certainly gotten my money s worth i also want to point something out to the prospective amazon shopper that i wish i had known while this product is great as i described please be aware through which retailer amazon sells this item one of the retailers offering this product here is stacks and stacks if you go to the effort of looking at the company s website you will quickly learn that their products center around shelves small containers etc but not around kitchen items that said the grater seems to be constantly listed as in stock when it is in reality not stacks and stacks will have to order the product from the manufacturer and it will take much longer than the stated delivery estimate it actually took so long when i ordered the item that i had to file a claim through amazon to get a refund the company itself refused to respond to any email while i cannot attest to the company s reliability with other items i advise you to forgo ordering it from them 
a seller item arrived just as described no problems at all very nice transaction 
holy mackerel my carpet is clean i have a jack russell terrier and a rat terrier and now a new baby i have been fighting a losing battle for years with my poochies wiry fur getting ground into my carpet i tried the furminator products which were great for temporarily reducing their shedding but this didn t address the mess that had already happened to my carpets and apholstry every time i would set anything on the floor even just after vacuuming it would have hair stuck all over the bottom of it now that just isn t going to fly with a baby in the house i have laughed so many times reading reviews of these dyson vacuum cleaners why would anyone drop half a grand on a vacuum cleaner but when a friend with cats told me about the dc animal she bought and how much stuff came up out of her carpet i was intrigued as time wore on i became obsessed and then my tax return showed up i selected the ball because of the enhanced maneuverability it touts i have lots of furniture and twists and turns that made vacuuming tedious if i am going to spend this kind of money by gosh i need to not only get all possible crud out of my carpet but i need to be able to do it with ease and speed let me tell you something this thing is luxurious yes it is a luxurious vacuum cleaner ! compared to my hoover wind tunnel it is quiet i can hear my baby cry over the motor it glides over my carpet you can see an actual strip of clean carpet after one pass several passes render the carpet almost pristine the stabilizer bar will provide that traditional vacuum handling for when your wrist is tired but turn it off and the ball allows you to glide in zig zags around corners up under furniture it s just fabulous the canister is also fantastic i was skeptical after having to fight my old vacuum s canister outside and covering myself with the crud i had just vacuumed but all you truly have to do with this thing is hold it over a trash can or inside a grocery bag and press the release button the crud just drops out then you run the bottom of the cannister over the edge of the trash can and it will shut the bottom of the canister for you fast clean easy praise the lord it also works on bare floors you turn off the mechanical brush bar so it doesn t scuff and the thing just sucks up everything one reviewer comments that the mini turbo brush is worthless i thought so too until i realized that i didn t have it properly attached to the hose once it was attached properly i used it to suck my short wiry dog hair off of their wool dog beds and of it came off ! now i am sorry but you just wouldn t see that with any other vacuum cleaner so now i can put things on the floor with no dog hair sticking to it i can vacuum without hurting myself without aggravating my allergies too much my house smells cleaner i retract all mean things that i have said about people being idiots for blowing this kind of money on a vacuum cleaner if you have pets then i would strongly recommend this product i love my dyson animal dc 
had ordered more my mom and dad gave me an al dente pasta machine for christmas several years ago my adult kids just love the noodles it makes so this year i got them each one for christmas they were all very happy about them and they have all used them already guess i ll make cooks out of them yet i love mine use it a lot easy fun to use makes the best home made noodles ever ! cheryle m lansing mi 
the best quick bread loaf pans ever this pan is a must have if you make quick bread banana bread pumpkin bread etc it bakes much more evenly than a non stick pan the loaves are spaced evenly apart to allow for even cooking you will get nice evenly moist loaves of bread with no hard dry crust lightly grease the pans to prevent sticking and cleanup is a breeze this pan is the best seriously i have two and i love them 
meyer ceramic bakeware i gave this as a christmas gift to my mom she has always used glass and metal bakeware for the price it was a steal 
not bad i would definately recommend this over the cheaper plastic models out there but i would also caution that it is not for the weak armed it takes a lot of muscle to use this french fry cutter and i always have to make my husband do it overall though is tough enough to do the job as long as you are too 
solid cleaner this unit cleans floors very well even short berber patterned carpet that has different levels it is easy to use with the separate soap dispenser overall it works well my only compliants would be the upholstery attachment spray is sporadic and it is hard to clean out the used water tank and path i have dogs and it takes some work to get all the dog hair out 
pleased with the product i love the capability that can be transferred from a microwave to an oven i use it primarily for my frozen crab cake that i microwave it first for couple minutes then move it to an oven to finish cooking with crisp textures 
cheese knife this cheese knife is very good quality and every bit as good if not better than as our cutco cheese knife which cost many times more the design is similar to the cutco knife in that it has holes in the blade to keep resistance down while cutting the cheese it cuts smoothly and effortlessly and there are no wires that keep working loose as in wire cheese cutters i bought extra ones to give as gifts and everyone loves them 
a must for deep fryers if you own a deep fryer and do not know about these yet chances are you really need these depending on how often you use your deep fryer you could need replacements in less than a month so what do they do simple they keep oily fumes from invading your house when your frying up a batch of french fries the oily smell in the air is not normal and the fumes can leave an oily residue on anything and everything so you gotta have them as far as i can tell rival is the only company that still makes the filters for home units at a reasonable price 
makes fantastic toast but doesn t match my stand mixer this toaster makes the most evenly cooked toast i have ever seen even better than my slot cuisinart toaster my only issue with this toaster is that the pineapple color i purchased this month does not match the pineapple stand mixer i bought last summer this toaster has a green hue to it where my mixer is solidly yellow i purchased the toaster coffee maker and blender together in december and they all have a green hue to the pineapple color its so bad they actully clash if you put them side by side with the stand mixer maybe if you are buying the whole set at the same time you won t have this problem my mixer broke after months so i am sending it back i hope they send me one that matches this toaster 
aerobie aeropress coffee maker a good way to make a cup of coffee particularly good if you want a fresh brewed taste but don t need to brew a full pot for only one or two people can be stored in a cabinet or drawer eliminating the use of counter space a must have for small kitchens 
my wife and i are in love with this ice cream spade i gotta warn you though it s not for the weak or the timid but if you re serious ice cream lovers like we are despise those ball scoopers and other cheap almost useless excuses for an ice cream scoop this is the ticket heavy strong sturdy but stylish and comfortable too this may be the best bucks we ve spent this year i m thinking of how many lucky people will get an inexpensive but great christmas gift this year 
superb ice crusher this ice crusher is just exactly what i wanted for my home bar i positively did not want an ice shaver which seems to be all the rage today the size of the crushed ice pieces are much larger than shaved ice and perfect for drinks the only limitation i have found is that you must not feed the cubes in too rapidly which is not a problem i am extremely pleased with this crusher and recommend it highly for drinks shrimp cocktails etc 
excellent product not only my copper cookware shines this even cleans the rust on the bottom of my cast iron cookware a very good product 
life saver this shower filter is awesome ! i just moved into my apartment and have always had soft water prior to this the filter really helped with my hair it was getting dry and brittle and my skin isn t as dry and ashy i just wish they would give an estimate for the life of the filter for a single person i have no idea how long the filter will last guess i ll just wait till my hair starts to get dry again 
best lil deep fryer i have waited a long time to buy one not sure why i was going to go with a t fal product glad i didn t got this one home and waited awhile before i actually used it then i deep fried chicken patties and french fries what a dinner we had it was gr the frier heated up quickly made the food fast did everything i wanted it to it has continued to work as expected ever since i picked it up even easy clean up nice ! 
wish i bought this years ago because of the expense i thought about whether or not i should buy the steampress or just use the old fashioned method of ironing i ve had the steampress about months now and it s great i can iron men s shirts inless than a minute pants in seconds with beautiful creases i also leave it set up in our den so it s easy to get to and turn on and off i never have to use the old fashioned ironing board iron etc 
great looking functioning machine got the machine about three weeks ago and have since made between to cafe lattes first and foremost the machine looks great primary reason for purchase as it definitely seemed a great visual piece in our kitchen i had read reviews and found nothing that scared me away functionality so went for it all in all thus far we have no complaints it froths low fat milk using the steamer w ease and even does a good job w low fat soy milk which has to be a good test of a machines steaming capabilities the temp gage is great and fully functional i like simplicity especially when it comes to anything requiring ac power as it typically means less to break down the espressione is about as straight forward as can be note i have never owned an espresso machine before but used a krups one for about a year while living overseas in a family house the espressione is a total step up i have an obsessive attention to detail and couldn t find any corners cut w this device only module that they could have possibly been better w is the grounds tray which as listed in other reviews is a bit cheap plasticy not a big issue as you can t even see it unless you remove it to clean out the grounds 
new religious collar what can i say about this collar that it works miracles its one piece instead of a box that hangs off of a regular nylon collar ensuring contact it also has a right fit test to make sure it s doing it s job it s waterproof even allowing the dog to swim with it on no on off buttons on the collar itself it turns on off like a tv remote using the remote which comes with a lanyard you can be far from your dog which is let s face it when they tend to misbehave anyway there is levels and a boost that let s you up it by for that moment there is also a timeout safety feature in case you hold the button down for seconds or longer the best part is the tone button the manual says you can use it for a reward or warning just not the two that would just confuse fido my dog learned quickly that the tone means a warning that way if i press that button she acknowledges it and stops the behavior straight away this also means there s no correction after awhile since the dog learns what comes after the tone unless you use it for a reward sound then i guess it s more like clicker training so why is it the new religious collar because it makes a believer out of the dog and since the dog sees the behavior as getting a correction and not you giving it it seems to make training quicker because of course you don t want your dog afraid of you now i know there are people who think it s inhumane to use a collar like this personally we tried the citronella collar and i wish i d saved my money it didn t do squat for our doberman i think this collar is more humane than having a dog put down which is exactly what people do when they find they can t handle their unruly aggressive dogs 
sensational soap pump while searching for the perfect kitchen soap dispenser on amazon i came across two which looked identical at first in reading the reviews of both i noticed a huge difference in customer satisfaction looking closer at the photos of each there was a slight difference between the two don t be fooled ! the progressive international soap dispenser is the best ! beautiful and durable my husband hasn t broken it yet amazing 
good quality i got this at a very good price and i recommend it highly i had another one before but dropped it and broke it i use it all the time 
going strong after years after years of marriage rough kids different houses moves multiple dishwashers i m ready for more i think my kids have lost some of the spoons in the garbage so i m ready for more and am ordering another set my only beef is that you can t just order teaspoons but have to get another whole set 
wonderful for your dog i have a basset hound more importantly a demanding basset hound that constantly tries forcing me to not walk but run with him whenever we go for a walk i was afraid when purchasing this retractable leash that the cord would not be strong enough to hold up over time and that the cord would probably rip out the minute the dog spots a rabbit or another dog and takes off running but so far three years later it hasn t happened this leads me to conclude that this leash is a wonderful purchase oh and the fact that there s a handle located conveniently for you to hold is another bonus i mean come on the handle fits in your hand nice and snug good leash i highly recommend it 
wonderful healthy cookware i was looking for good solid cookware that would allow me to bake salmon vegetables instead of wrapping in aluminum foil the deep dish washes out clean and when covered keep the food moist and delicious i sometimes use a lid from another piece of le creuset cookware to cover this pan and turn it into a clay oven of sorts i am very pleased 
pfaltzgraff empire covered butter dish excellent product i especially like the roominess of the cover no more butter crawling up the sides ! yea 
one happy puppy my dog abby loves this duck she runs around the house with it in her mouth and she loves to make it quack 
never replace a bulb again but get frosted cover instead this is the only two led light i can find it s a little larger in size than it has to be but it puts off more light than the single led version uses a maximum of watt of electricity get the frosted cover instead of this clear one the frosted looks nicer more like a real nightlight hi lo switch slightly controls light output led s are slightly blue in color 
salt shaker i bought the pepper grinder in the store but couldn t find the salt grinder and this one is the perfect match 
wonderful toaster this toaster is great ! it s a real space saver with big toaster power this seller is wonderful too packed with care and received quickly and safely ! a to all 
presto keeps improving with time this pressure cooker replaced a thirty year old presto the new cooker works flawlessly is easy to clean and store and seems sturdy enough to last for thirty years 
good sheets i like these sheets the only thing is they are heavy so i m going to wait till winter when it gets cold to put them back on the bed 
terrific toaster this makes the greatest toast and like the style of this toaster also the t fal name has never been a let down their products have always been number one thank you the anthony 
great if you get good popcorn having read the other users reviews of this product i was not really interested in buying it so many of them complained of rough soggy chewy or bad tasting popcorn my brother picked up one of these for the holidays swung by the fresh market and got some very good fresh gourmet popping corn used some butter oil topping and wow it was unbelievably good ! i asked to borrower his popper to try at our house and stopped off at the grocery grabbed some orville redenbaucher oil and corn terrible worst popcorn i had ever tried i went back to the grocery with the corn and returned it one of the managers mentioned that since the advent of microwave corn the stores rarely move the old kernel style corn said that it could be literally years old since there is no real shelf life expiration i went to another whole foods type store bought some organic black popping corn and used the same oil as before fantastic ! unfortunately i think this item is going to get panned on here by many users because the corn they are using in the popper is simply old not sure where one would go to find it fresh other than maybe a boutique supermarket but for what its worth this product is great when used with great popcorn when you use lousy corn its very lousy 
excellent price plus bonus how did this arrive so quickly it was shipped yesterday and was on my doorstep today this was a great deal for some reason the blue was less than other colors a piece spatula set worth was an added bonue yay ! 
functional opener and helps to avoid splitting a cork i found the pedrini double lever opener to be a good buy there are many others which look similar but look closer the pedrini has a true wound metal screw while many others only give you a die cast screw the difference is important as the die cast style has a thick solid center to the screw so it must displace more cork while turning thus increasing the effort and the risk of cork splitting the diecast screw is also not nearly as strong as the wound metal and can crack and break it is also heavier it is a good value a good manufacturer and a good choice 
dog collar for wireless fence works great actually better than the original with more features 
excellent quality grinds i bought this grinder from my local coffee house on the recommendation of several of the employees at the shop i ve had it for almost months and i couldn t be happier i have used several other burr grinders all of which have produced far more coffee dust than i would like i use a press pot so i use fairly coarse grinds and the consistency of the grinds from this machine are perfect i haven t had any problems with the grinder not functioning the same button that turns it on turns it right back off i honestly don t care how loud it is as i would expect a coffee grinder to be loud it is not difficult to clean at all i just use the included bristle cleaner and a moist paper towel it only takes a couple of minutes 
lenox holiday china i am so thrilled with this purchase that i still have a place setting out to look at ! the price was fantastic and the delivery excellent amazon came through again ! i am now hoping to buy other pieces 
good quality i bought these because i wanted silicone trivets but it was cheaper to get a set of potholders actually i haven t seen any that are cheaper especially since you mostly only have the option of buying one at a time i love that they double as potholders trivets and jar openers i wasn t convinced they d make a good jar opener but i tried it and they work ! i gave the product four stars only because as trivets i don t think they are the best looking to have on your dining table 
you need this vacuum wow ! our old vacuum finally bit the dust and it was time to buy a new one concerned about quality and function my wife and i looked at all the big price vacuums on the market yet we were hesitant to pay a small fortune for a vacuum cleanliness is a high priority in our household especially with a one year old son who puts everything in his mouth ! i read a ton of reviews and finally decided to take a chance on this vacuum and i am so glad i did we thought our house was clean but after using this vacuum just one time in one room we were frightened at just how dirty our floors were based on how much this vacuum picked up from our floor this thing has great power a nice wide head and is so easy to use that my five year old wants to help vacuum we love it so much we are buying another one for our clothing store the vacuum is a bit loud and heavy however if you are vacuuming the noise shouldnt matter all that much the weight actually enables us to move it around furniture easier than a lightwieght because it tracks better don t spend for a vacuum we bought this for less than with free shipping and we couldnt be happier if you need a vacuum and have a family or pets this is the vacuum you need you wont be disappointed 
not too shabby it is thicker than other bed pads but not as thick as i expected quite cushy and comfortable to sleep on easy to put on the bed 
best stand fan it is powerful attractive and extremely reliable easy to assemble and the remote is great 
the best juicer available i highly recommend this juicer i live in florida and have a huge pink grapefriut tree as well as an orange lemon and lime tree in my back yard as you would expect my juicer has to be heavy duty and easy to use and clean i have purchased and discarded most other juicers due to t ook up too much counter space too flimsy too hard to clean too noisy or totally ineffective etc this juicer is elegant the rack and pinion compressor will take all the juice out of medium to large fruit small fruit you need to stack high but that s more efficient anyway it s heavy but not more than most juicers and it gives you the leverage you need i never move mine off the counter so i don t mind the weight the easily removable cup rinses out in the sink so it s ready to reuse in a flash it doesn t need a plug and it s quiet unlike electric models you can fit a pint lager glass or a cup cup measure under the spout i must use it to times a day and i ve had mine now for over years big thumbs up from me 
great product i have had my steamer for about years now and i love it i haven t used the iron in ages it heats up fast and does a great job it also sits flat which most small steamers do not do this is convenient if you want to set it down to grab the next article of clothing i bought one for my son and my niece i tell people forget the iron just get this steamer you can use it on almost all fabrics unless the label states don t use steam i even take it when i travel because it is pretty light weight 
thank you bionaire our house has a very damp basement and to combat that we purchased a bionaire bdq about a year and a half ago and it worked just dandy until a little over a week ago when all of a sudden it simply stopped pulling in any moisture just like that fan still spins when you power it up but no moisture collects in the reservoir from what i ve gleaned in the past week about the workings of dehumidifiers over the internet the compressor on the unit must have bugged out welli phoned bionaire s customer service line and they offered to immediately replace my defective bdq with this model the bdq as the bdq was out of stock and wouldn t be available until november november a few days later the ups trcuk arrives with our new dehumidifier this model looks a lot like the model only it s bigger it is very elegantly designed for a dehumidifier and so far it seems to work just great pulling in pint after pint of h oheres the rub i must dock this product one star because it is extremely noisy by noisy i don t mean refrigerator noisy i am talking jumbo jet taking off in your living room noisy it is one loud mutha i have no idea how bionaire feels they can get away with referring to this machine as quietech but it works i just hope they fixed the bugs with the faulty compressor in this model time will tell with regard to that issue anyway it does have a year warranty oh and that wireless indicator is junk synched it up with the unit and then all it did was beep wife made me yank out the batteries very annoying bil 
good price for solid warm flannel duvet cover i bought this a few weeks ago on amazon and loved it within the first minute of snuggling underneath for this price you can t beat super soft and super warm highly recommend 
pleasure keeps my butter the real stuff not margarine soft and able to spread on soft bread love it 
oxo soap dispensing sponge brush this is a convenient tool for washing hand dishes adding soap is easy its adequate sponge size and comfortable handle make it nice to use even with lots of dishes 
knives are great block should be redesigned this set was a replacement for a set i owned the knives are a huge improvement sharp no flexing when cutting through hard items and the set includes all the knives an amateur cook will use however the wood block is a different story the holes go completely through the wood block and the steak knives are too long so that the tips of the bottom row extend past the block this means they scratch the owner s counter and possibly dull the knife tips as a solution i store half the steak knives in a drawer not ideal but i never heard a response from an email sent to henckels website if the block was redesigned it would be a five star product 
doors only partially solid oak and missing instructions this item came well packaged but was missing the assembly instructions a quick call to the seller resulted in an e mailed pdf copy being sent i searched the internet for instruction and most stores stated that you needed to e mail or call for a copy i think the manufacturer should swallow the cost and print the pages of instructions and include them the assembly was very easy and was not missing any hardware the overall quality is decent the product details are a little foggy everything on the unit is mdf except the very front of the doors which is a nice oak the product description stated the entire door is solid oak not the case as the sides top and bottom as well as shelves in the doors are all mdf the back of the unit is rigid cardboard overall i am pretty happy with the construction i did have to redrill one of the holes because when assembled the non locking door left side has a latch on the inside that did not match up with the predrilled hole i would recommend this cabinet based on its storage capacity relatively low price and ease of assembly just don t expect anything that will last several moves and a lifetime of use 
great breadmaker i bought this breadmaker because i wanted one that makes a normal shaped loaf it makes great big loaves and is relatively easy to use just be sure to follow the instructions carefully and i recommend that you use the recipes created for the machine unless you are a baking pro nothing smells better than a homemade loaf of bread baking in the kitchen i have not bought a loaf of bread since i ve owned this fine bread making machine 
we are happy with this purchase the pitcher retains the beverage temperature well based on th eonline image we thought the colour would be a graded blue to only discoevr the pitcher was a solid blue from top to bottom we love the bright vibrant colour and find that it adds to our table at any meal 
really makes the brush roll move i broke the belt of the vacuum when i first tried it replacing was easily done and now it works prefect but that s not what baffled me it arrived the day after i ordered it i didn t have to go one day without a working vacuum 
soft with a good fit we are verry satisfied with our pinzon sheets we had pruchased other more expensive sheets in the past and these were just as good if not better than the fancy name brand the two things that were a deciding factor in my purchase were the free shipping and the depth of the pockets when the sheets arrived i was more than happy as they fit our pillow top matrice quite well and were ever so soft i was looking for deep pocket sheets and these didn t say that in the description so i was not sure how they would fit i have since purchased several more sets from pinzion including many of their plad ones here in alaska there is nothing better than a set of soft warm flannel sheets on a cold winter night they are nice in the summer as well 
super great this bowl is very durable and i love the different colors that it comes in the bowl is dish washer and microwave safe and my kids have banged them in the sink what seems like hundreds of times we basically use them for eating cereal but have used them for eating ice cream popcorn nachos etc i love these bowls and am going to buy a set of fiestaware for my mom 
tea forone i bought this as a gift for a tea lover along with a few other tea accessories she loved it it s got a classic look it s not gaudily painted like something you d find at starbucks it gets the job done the semi gloss finish gives it a sort of home made feel which contrasts the robotic perfection of the curves it sits comfortably in the kitchen both modern and rustic 
very nice but sorta small this is a neat little filter and i mean little ! the cone part hangs down into the cup and is around at the top tapering down to at the bottom perfect for a nice little cup of tea an oz cup of tea my tea drinking is done i guess in mugsize amounts of oz so this is a bit bitty for me i bought a tf now that s more my size gonna return this mini one and get another great filters you bet 
quality riedel is always a quality product you can never go wrong with them 
great originally i was a hesitant to buy a remanufactured dyson but minutes after i started using it i could definitely tell the difference between other vacuum s and dyson s it works great and i haven t had any problems whatsoever a great vacuum for a great price 
saved my wardrobe i live in a tiny manhattan apartment with basically one closet this device literally saved me from having to weed through my closet and give my clothes away to goodwill it manages to double up the space in your closet and allow you so much more room to breath allowing you to get all the clothes into a limited space i put my blazers and dresses on the top rail and then on the hanging part i put all my skirts its efficient and nicely designed and worked wonders with my cramped closet space its great 
better than prescription my golden retriever has had ear infections since she was weeks old over the years we have tried allergy shots dietary changes and prescription ointments all costing a fortune we tried zymox and it is absolutely fantastic her ear infections clear within a few days of treatment the itching and head shaking stop immediately after application and if i treat her ears once or twice a week after an infection clears i can keep her clear this stuff is great and at the price of prescription and no vet charges i m happy to keep it on hand 
its worth the price its a good filter does what its intended to do and quite silent for the price its worth it 
buy this this pillow is incredible i got it for my boyfriend because he was having neck pain when he woke up in the mornings the neck pain is gone and he sleeps like a baby it s great 
the best big dog toy ever we have a pound lab husky mix she manages to destroy soft toys vinyl toys rope toys squeaker toys chew bones just about everything in under minutes especially if left unsupervised she has of these large red kong toys that have lasted for over a year ! they are the best toys for large aggressive chewers the kong spray that you can purchase to spray inside the toy made our dog sick we have since learned that many other brand name treats also fit inside the toy if you squash it a little bit 
take back your sink i bought one of these from amazon weeks ago with the extra filters for half of what i would have paid retail at first my boyfriend nixed the fountain as it was very loud luckily i remembered another reviewer had mentioned that the unit could be noisy if the water level was low once i filled it up almost to the rim we could barely hear it the cats adore it haven t been in the sink or toilet well maybe once or twice since we bought it i give it stars only because it is rather difficult to clean it s a great deal for a really good product 
i wish i d bought feliway a long time ago to the feliway product description information above i would also add aids in calming cats who manage stressful chronic health conditions my yr old neutered male cat manages several chronic health conditions which at times create seemingly unrelated behavioral issues when flare ups occur that jangle his nerves when his ibd is not well controlled my otherwise angelic cat becomes stressed out does deadly things chewing through power cords consuming inedible objects eating plants untouched for years climbing to jumping falling from extremely high places aggravating his arthritis more when he s not feeling well acting out is his way of externalizing his bad nerves telling me i don t feel well help me so i bought a feliway diffuser for him for his birthday a few weeks ago the change in my cat s behavior was noticeable within the first few hours after plugging it in initially i noticed a personality change sort of a mellowing effect reflecting a more leveled out increased general sense of well being i see less lethargy more interest in social interaction his environment play it s a subtle overall field effect but his happiness joy somehow seem happier i ve noticed i ve had an easier time with giving him his regular medications brushing his teeth it s a synthetic feline facial pheromone but i call it the airborne feline prozac and without putting more chemicals into his system that don t belong in the body their problematic side effects my cat seems to appreciate the general change in the overall atmosphere of his home occasionally he even sleeps underneath the diffuser the benefits my cat experiences also pass on to me because if he is less stressed upset doing fewer life threatening things in reaction to his nerves then i m less stressed out as well i d rather buy him feliway than spend money on veterinary visits additional medication to deal with new problems he creates when he s stressed and there have been a lot of them feliway contains an odorless oil by human standards it does not upset my cat s severe asthma or allergies nor my own more moderate conditions in fact i am wondering that if he s less stressed out psychologically in turn physiologically if there might even be less asthma less digestive upset due to a reduction in the cycle of internalized stress and if it improves his overall quality of life i d much rather buy him peace instead of more doctors i live in a small person unit diffuser does seem to cover the entire place i unplug ours when the window is open plug it back in when it s closed while i sleep or am away any time i think he might benefit from it the plastic bottle can be unscrewed from the plug in unit recapped to preserve it until your next use this may help to extend the week life span recommended in the packaging information we ll find out i would also add that the diffuser gets warm but not hot to the touch certaintly not hot enough to burn a hand or singe a whisker or fur i have handled the diffuser many times during use i have no fear of allowing my cat to be directly near it the only negative aspect of this product so far as i can determine is how much you ll want to kick yourself for waiting to buy it for long as you did as a pet store employee recently told me it is one of the few behavior mod products for cats on the market that actually does work while there is no substitute for building maintaining a solid trusting relationship with your pet or for seeking competent veterinary care feliway does seem like it could be a great adjunct to it feliway gets thumbs paws up from kitty me 
once you use a miele you will never use another this canister vacuum is perfect for multitasking quickly and easily i have carpeting wood and vinyl floors in my house and used two different vacuums for it when i bought the miele i was able to get rid of the other two cleaners and use this one throughout it does an incredible job of getting up everything pet hair dust crumbs little bits of stuff those nasty dust bunnies and illusive corner cob webs which seem to appear overnight as if by magic or maybe time to get new glasses ! in one room during a spring clean i started at the top literally ! went from the ceiling and the molding down to the walls curtains floors lamp shades and everything else in between all i had to do was change the cleaning head and adjust the suction amount all simply and quickly done the fact that it is also fairly quiet was a real bonus i could actually vacuum while little one was taking his nap now that is a major plus for any appliance i know the price is high but you are paying for the quality of the vacuum an investment if you will it is very well made and will last for many many years i recommend this vacuum highly 
riedel cabernet glasses these glasses are broad enough to allow for a nice nose while small enough to use at the dinner table without appearing akward they are also very elegant

i love these scoops i have found these to be very handy i ve used them for kiwi mangoes even for making potato skins i use the red one to scoop out some of the potato from its skin leaving a nice shell to fill with cheese etc because of their shapes they are better than using a spoon to scoop stuff out it takes a little finesse to use them but i have found that they make certain prep jobs easier safer i don t need to use a knife in some cases and less messy 
eclipse used for dwarf seahorses i purchased an eclipse so i could set it up as a habitat for dwarf seahorses i put a filter sponge over the intake pipe so the adults and babies would not get pulled into the filter i set the tank up weeks before i got the seahorses so it could fully cycle after it was cycled i purchased adult dwarf seahorses from a local dealer i life in fl within hours males had given birth and another gave birth yesterday and i have seen pairs doing the courting dance so i know more babies will be on the way i have lost only one adult so far and the rest appear to be thriving i keep the tank full of newly hatched baby brine shrimp for them to feed on and i do a one gallon water change per day this tank is the perfect size for a population of dwarf seahorses and the filter does not make too much turbulence for them the lighting is enough to keep caulerpa macro agae and i also have a gorgonian coral in there as well i have always wanted to keep seahorses and now i am keeping them and raising them thank to my eclipse

great product and great service most people i showed this wok set to could not believe the price i paid for it this kit contains everything you need to start wok n except the food i seasoned it using the instructions sent to me in an email by the shop owner and what had looked like a dull lifeless hunk of metal took on an almost sculptural look of bronze patterned metal it was almost a shame to cook on it but now that i have a few meals on the surface water beads up and rolls off and nothing sticks to the shiny surface i did need to take a metal file to the outside edges before seasoning as they were quite sharp but otherwise everything is just what i was looking for i have already placed my next order from the wok shop 
great service pizzelle press this press is in my book it is the best one that ive ever used serviceon delivery prompt fast thank you 
a very sharp knife this is a great little knife it if very sharp from the factory and has kept its edge nicely the handle has a ridge that runs the length this makes it a little more comfortable than a completely cylindrical handle this is my girlfriend s favorite knife she reaches for it when doing small chopping jobs like herbs and onions it is very maneuverable and has a good heft for a small knife the blade is thick and makes such a small knife deceivingly useful i am a bigger guy and i usually use a knife but i find myself reaching for this knife more often a disadvantage to it being so think a blade is that it cannot double as a paring knife more delicate cuts like thinly slicing tomatoes are difficult because the thick blade pushes the tomato slices out overall this is a very fine knife for the price ergonomics on the handle are hit or miss i like the handle and so does my girlfriend but a few people have said it didn t fit right in their hand i would say those are the minority of people who have used this knife if you like to choke up on your knives this may be less comfortable on this knife than others as the round blunt ending where the shaft meets the handle is not easily pinched when gripped in this way 
amazing knives i bought theese knifves to start out my first kitchen i can t belive how amazing they are usally i struggled with my parents old knives just to cut things like tomatoes with theese knives i am able to slice tomatoes effortlessly dicing things like garlic and onions is a task i usued to leave for the food processor but belive me you feel like a professional chef they way you can run these knifes through foods warning they will make you want to cook more than you do now ! 
had it for almost a year very nice looks great in fish tank and very good quality you may not notice but the back part is also in detai 
good price good item my bofriend and i were moving into a small house with no counter space and knew that we needed something to put our microwave on i had gone on target com to see what they had and was dissapointed to see the bad reviews for this particular product the other day though i couldn t beat the price so i bought it hoping the people who wrote the bad reviews had put it together wrong this product is great ! it holds our medium sized microwave our toaster on the slide out rack and our quesidilla maker on the bottom rack the four hooks on the side are great for our hot mits and hot pads this product was very easy to assemble and it didn t take that long either i would highly recommend buying it and making sure that you read the directions carefully 
why are people so stupid it s a wonderful cutting board also available at the store i m a bartender and chef and can honestly say this is something i ve found very useful any good chef knows you need two cutting boards one wood and one of a polyethylene or resistant plastic this one really lives up to the description and works well for mulitple tasks the price tag isn t bad at all for the cutting size and it hides the knife marks very well that and it just looks great in the kitchen i use boards like this in my restaurant all the time and wouldn t go without them dont listen to the idiot who thought he could buy a x solid granite cutting board for ten bucks not that a rock cutting board is worth anything as it would ruin your knives fyi to the moron ampampquotprotect your countertops from scratches with these lightweight tough polyethylene cutting boards ampampquot yah nothing at all dimwit 
works fine fins total not but i am satisfied with it ok first of all i am very satisfied with the trr it is silent and heats the room well even on the watt setting unlike the picture the unit i received has middle fins and end fins for a total of i don t know if they changed the model or used the wrong picture but i am satisfied with what i got and mention it because it seems to be a big issue 
classy and delicate i love the reidel line of wine glasses both stemless and with stems they are delicate though so not for the clumsy although maybe stemless is better for the klutz since it has less opportunity to fall over they make great gifts 
nice winter grill this grill comes in handy in the middle of michigan winter when we can t fire up our outdoor bbq it cooks quickly and cleans fairly easily i have never dared to place it in the dishwasher although it sounds like a lot of people have so i might try it there are a few downfalls you do get grease splatters on the countertop no matter how careful you are and if you like your meat medium well be prepared to crack a window open because the burnt smell will linger for days otherwise 
beautiful machine very happy with the proformance of the processor made the pizza recipe with it and the dough was done great the pizza still needs to be worked on lol allinallfantastic product 
the best soup mug i love this mug it is the absolute best i searched all over for a mug that would hold my soup one can of campbell s chunky has a handle is understated and elegant and has a lid to prevent splatter and spills this is a great mug 
best one out there if you are a serious cook this is the tenderizer you have been looking for my first tenderizer was the hammer type tenderizer it did an honest job tenderizing the meat along with your knuckles ! for obvious reasons i did not enjoy working with this particular model my second tenderizer was the stamper style again it did an honest job but my hand would slip down on the handle and i would begin tenderizing my hand my last attempt at procuring a tenderizer i could live with is this particular model i love the offset handle no more sore knuckles or hand the weight is fantastic ! basically you just let the weight of the tenderizer do most of the work for you your job is just guide the plate to it s intended target the surface of the tenderizing plate lets you cover a wider area than the hammer or stamper style thus reducing your time in half clean up is easy either wash by hand or place in the dish washer so what s not to like 
easy as the presto granpappy electric deep fryer is as easy to use as plug it in wait minutes and it s ready to fry your chicken legs or breast or french fries or any other fryable food in minutes your food is done and your eating nice juicy food the presto granpappy electric fryer is a defenant

this is the one this knife is great fine balance heavey enough that you don t have to force it very sharp seams to keep edge good handle fits hand just great don t think you could buy any better or come close to the price for this quality knife 
time to clean up the house before i bought a dirt devil i owned a vacuum that worked great for over years in january i broke that vacuum on a friday the th yes that really is a bad day thanks to me accidentally ramming the front of it into the side of the living room coffee table after it hit the table i knew immediately it was a goner sometimes you just know also the electrical smoke shooting out the front was another good indication no one to blame but me it actually upset me because before that innocent everyone in my house kept accusing me of knocking a big dent into the side of the dishwasher in the kitchen i really believe i didn t put that dent there and i tried hard to defend myself every time that topic came up but now i look incredibly guilty because of the way i knocked the vacuum into the coffee table and ruined it i m an innocent man ! i did not bang the vacuum into the dishwasher and the worst part about that vacuum breaking was that i was actually done cleaning the floors before it broke and so i shut the vacuum off but then and this will bother me forever i looked down on the carpet and realized that i had missed a spot near the coffee table so i turn the vacuum back on and then i accidentally hit the coffee table and destroyed the vacuum if i had never bothered with that spot on the floor the vacuum probably would continue to run fine today a mistake i have to live with after it was discovered that we couldn t save the vacuum cleaner we went somewhere to get another one actually i stayed home while my dad shopped around for years we saw commercials for dirt devils and figured they would be a very wise purchase well that turned out to be not entirely true but in another way it was entirely true let me try to explain why i think this is a good vacuum cleaner i have to warn you it s kind of mind bogglingthe one big complaint people seem to have with dirt devils also happened to me one time i was vacuuming and i left it running while i was busy trying to arrange the dog beds across the floor in a way i could easily vacuum over them well while i was doing that the vacuum was positioned on top of the cord and so it accidentally sucked up the cord made a big scary noise and damaged it i immediately ran over and unplugged it i had to wrap electrical tape around the spot on the cord that was damaged because the wires inside were exposed this happened after the second week we purchased it and i thought i was going to freak out because i thought i had just ruined a brand new vacuum it turned out to be okay truly a scary moment that was a sign to just take the dog beds outside for now on and shake the hair off myself i like how dirt devil vacuums have a plastic case design to hold the dirt and hair instead of messing with those darn vacuum bags vacuum bags are a pain in the butt because not all types are designed the same for instance one time i bought a pack bag of vacuum bags that had a round hole on top of the bag but the inside of my vacuum at home required bags with a square hole so we had to go back to the store and search for vacuum bags that were created with square shaped holes instead of round shaped holes so it would fit inside my vacuum a big unnecessary pain all bags should have either round or square holes not both anyway with the dirt devils plastic container design you can simply push a button to remove the container from the vacuum cleaner and empty the dirt and hair into your trashcan front yard and use a brush to wipe away any sticky remains no bags needed this is convenient but if there s one complaint it s that the container fills up after vacuuming the entire downstairs after only one time this includes the kitchen living room and den floors but i do have a big house as i mention above something very strange is going on with my dirt devil when i first bought the vacuum back in january i thought the sucking power was sort of weak and i had to go over certain areas on my carpet three or four times to completely clean it however as the weeks went by the sucking power gradually increased to where now i m afraid to leave the vacuum turned on over any kind of loose rugs for fear that the vacuum cleaner will suck the rug right off the floor i have no idea where this sudden burst of amazing power came from and why it s getting stronger as time goes on i don t know if i m happy about it either i think i am you just have to be careful not to leave the vacuum running over any kind of rug or doormat all i hope for is that my dirt devil vacuum lasts me until the end of this year i can t handle the frustration of buying vacuum after vacuum not only because of a money issue but also because you know how people can be they will continue to say i destroyed my vacuums by accusing me of being exceptionally harsh with them accusing me of pushing around my vacuums aggressively and angrily banging into the side of everything i come into contact with i m really not the kind of person that does that these people can just knock it off okay sometimes i break out into hives and get extremely itchy and during these moments it s hard to push the vacuum around calmly and carefully but i ve learned to just shut the vacuum off and wait for the itching to go away before starting it back up again so there s really not much for me to complain about when it comes to dirt devils okay so sometimes if you vacuum over cracker crumbs or something the crumbs will shoot back and hit your leg but please don t tell me that actually hurts you it s doing that because the vacuum is so damn powerful it can t help it ! it s a great vacuum for dog hair on hard floors the dirt devil is a pretty quick and wonderful experience too dog hair is gone in an instant the noise of the motor is louder than most this is true that s a slight problem but i only need to vacuum once a week so it s not like i have to hear the thing running everyday the noise would probably become a problem then but in the end my experience for the last three months with the dirt devil has been a good one 
thrilled with purchase i bought this for my sister as a christmas gift i was so glad i was able to find it since fiestaware black is retired this item was shipped promptly packaged very well and arrived in perfect condition i am very pleased with this transaction and my sister was thrilled with her gift

well worth the price have used pressure cookers for years and this is one of the best all parts easily washed even cooking very heavy stainless steel construction is small but perfect for people and large enough for vegtables i recommend this to new pressure cooker users as it is much less intimadating than many others 
fabulous i love these knives i have spent the last year or so looking at knive sets there are some very expensive ones out on the market ! i was so so about purchasing any as there was always something that i just didn t like such as the design or the grip shape the set itself or even the price when i found this set it all just popped i have given them a workout and they exceed all of the expectations i had for them i love the grips the design the price and most important the function it is a perfect set for the everyday cook i highly recommend these knives 
dog training collar having used a spray collar belonging to my friend s dog which only had levels of spray the commander having the beep feature is proving it to be superior as you can get the dog not to view the collar as something to be afraid of the only real problem noticed so far is that it is not waterproof and therefore has to be removed prior to deep paddling or swimming easy to forget ! terrific value compared to what it sells for in the uk especially with the weak dollar would recommend 
great single malt glasses excellent quality for this hard tofind specialty glassware available in a nice size set 
great dispenser i received one of these as a gift i love it ! i enjoy a p nut butter honey sandwich and this is the best way to apply honey to a sandwich without all the mess and cleanup 
the classic mug for coffee only everyone i know is fixated on making the perfect cup of coffee but let s face it a lot of the coffee you will drink for the rest of your life will be average or below that is where this mug comes in originally designed for diners and other cheap restaurants this mug has history and tradition behind it virtually any coffee will taste better in this mug the color is right off white the shape is right love those slightly concave sides and the heft the weight is perfect you won t be knocking this puppy over easily get six of these so that you always have one clean in your cupboard oh and if you are a tea drinker also like me don t even think of drinking tea from one of these for coffee consumption only 
fiestaware this was the first item that i purchased on amazon item was received in excellent condition and in a very timely manner very pleased 
fabulous flowing chocolate i recently purchased this item and used it for a party of about people i had read the reviews on line and decided on this one for the price that i wanted to spend we had to add a little extra oil at first to be sure that there were no clumps in it when we started the fountain up i had read some reviews where some people said the units that they bought were noisy and were only good for about an hour before the chocolate started to clump up this model works great ! it was relatively quiet also the chocolate was still flowing after everyone had left that evening we ran it for a good hours and it worked super ! i purchased nestle chocolate chips at the grocery store and followed the guidlines in the book that comes with it we melted the chocolate with the added canola oil in the microwave before adding it to the fountain clean up was very easy ! i can t wait to use it again for our up coming daughter s college graduation party in may and our wedding in july amazon services are also great 
famous maker towel set i m impressed with the quality of these towels i purchased them because i needed hunter green and could not find that color locally they are large soft absorbent towels 
dry food dispenser is valuable addition this is a truly terrific upgrade to our kitchen we recently did a complete remodel and we were determined to make things handier to find and use the cereal dispenser is decorative as well as efficient

great tank for about three fish tank is well built but the plastic scratches easily the rule of thumb is inch per galon and if you intend to buy a goldfish with this baby you should not exceed i have neon tetras and a betta the betta is bullet proof can breath air but one of my neo s isnt looking to great im considering moving the neos into a larger tank and leaving just the betta in this tank 
classy yet durable these ramekins are perfect for flan custard pudding and the like they are beautiful yet very heavy duty after buying one set in cherry red i bought another set in flame weeks later these are a definate must buy 
great whisk great whisk ! made in the usa dishwasher safe ! perfect gift for my chef he even loves the ergonomic fit however the year warranty in the description is not mentioned in anything when i received the product i have concerns about the silicone wearing or peeling and the year warranty made me feel better about it now there is no indication on the le crueset paperwork indicating any warranty 
very sturdy excellent quality and rich color i tried it as a skillet takes a while to heat up i think this would be best oven roasting or to saute onions followed by stove top roasting very heavy of course and the lid too is heavy enough to hold in juicy steam this is a large piece you could prepare a meal for four you want to be smart in how much you move this around with hand trouble i ve learned to use straight wrists to carry it close to me when cool of course then i take the water or food to the piece cook and serve from it right off the stove cool down and hug it to the sink i used smaller pieces of a similar brand for smaller meals with care this should serve you for a life time 
good functional furniture for the price vietnamese rubberwood filing cabinet and printer stand not bad to look at easy to assemble all parts fit drawer opens easily and closes square recommend for home use won t make an heirloom but functional and sturdy 
excellent quality assembly durability usability value this is the fourth size of these shelves i ve gotten one larger and two smaller let s call this one large the x large one was my first it is one shelf unit or two shelf units i use it as two units it is loaded with heavy power tools loaded tool boxes etc and handles it with no problem the medium sized ones are packed with garden supplies gallons of paint etc the small one is loaded with gallons of bleach and detergents and softener bottles this large size i use for boxes of house supplies some heavy some lite the product is as described and looks exactly like the picture quality zero defects with the legs shelves plastic height adjusters wheel assemblies welding and chrome plating the design is simple and effective the weight of the shelves and items of the shelves hold everything in place no screws assembly the instructions are poor but once you figure it out it is quick and easy and simply repetitive to put together i ve assembled all of mine by myself the first x large one i got took me an hour now it takes me minutes to put them together or tear them apart to change the shelf heights no special tools required all of mine came with a little wrench to tighten the wheel bolts a rubber mallet proved handy to tighten the shelves down on the plastic adjusters and to knock them loose to change the height as desired but a shoe works as well one corner of a shelf kept popping up and causing the plastic adjuster to pop off until i figured out i needed to get it on a level floor square up the legs by twisting the whole unit a little and whacked it with the mallet to wedge it down on the plastic adjuster caution don t step on any of the plastic height adjusters as you assmble it cause there are no extras to work with durability i can t imagine what i could put on it that would be heavy enough to break it compared to the laundry shelf hanger unit i bought from a competitor these shelves are commercial strength the laundry shelf wiggles and wobbles every time i touch it but these shelves are sturdy heavier than i expected too usability great i definately prefer the models with wheels for ease in rearranging my basement storage and for cleaning around etc even fully loaded with heavy items the x large one is easy to move around with wheels the shelves can be installed with the lip up or down stronger if the lip is down keeps things from falling off if the lip is up the wheel locks work well just place them both on a long side or opposite corners of each other the shelf spacing is very flexible with grooves for the plastic height adjusters every inch or so excellent for workshops garages basements pantry and comtemporary or chef quality kitchens but not something i d put in my living room at least not in chrome i d probably lose the wheels if i were to put it in the kitchen to soften the look a bit value i was pleasantly surprised i looked at the plastic shelves which cost less but for me the wheels the looks the adjustable heights and the durability was worth the extra money my sister has several versions of the plastic shelves in her basement and she doesn t like having to unload them or drag them across the floor to rearrange or clean but if all you re going to store on them is boxes of bows and wrapping paper then these shevles are probably overkill if i had a garage and or a place for them in the kitchen i d have more of them and put my heavy kitchen aid mixer and the like on one of these 
beautiful they are bigger than what i d consider ice cream bowls but thats perfect for me they came in perfect condition and are absolutely lovely 
nice presentation i don t drink tequila normally but i bought these as a gift for a friend who does he paid me back by pouring me a generous glass of patron silver now while i don t drink tequila i do appreciate all fine liquors so my first impression of these glasses was fragile i drink wine often and like a heavier glass as i am sometimes clumsy though these glasses did seem to be of high quality they showed the clarity and color of the tequila nicely they also allowed me to appreciate the aroma of the spirit without being overwhelmed by it it was more of a sipping glass but was shaped so that if you wanted to shoot it you could i believe it did make the experience more enjoyable it brought out taste and smell that i would not have normally smelled from tequila in a shot glass so if you appreciate fine tequila and think putting a bottle of anything into a shot glass is a sin i would recommend this for you if when i finish a wet bar in my home with nice liquors i will buy a set of these for myself for those special occasions when i entertain more sophisticated tequila drinkers 
great towels for price purchased sets of these towels bought sets at apiece and sets at apiece very soft and large towels very pleased with this purchase found some loose threads but not significant enough to complain about recommend buying as this was a great deal for a high quality item plan on ordering more 
great heavy lasagna pan this is a great looking x pan with good proportions it is really deep and makes a great tall lasagna it is extremely heavy when fully loaded with a lasagna its bulk gives it even cooking in the oven but can be difficult to get out of the oven after your lasagna is done i have made many other things in this pan with great results it is fairly non stick and has not stained even after several lasagnas the enamel is fairly bulletproof overall i really like this pan with its only weakness being heft however that heft is put to good use in very even cooking and keeping the lasagna warm at the table you won t be disappointed 
everybody can use a little le creuset i purchased this little pot as a gift for a friend something to hold all the kitchen utencils that we all use each day being a chef i know that i can rely on le creuset and this small pot is no diffrent i was so fond of it i have bought my self two for my own kitchen knowing that it can stand up to heat i have it next to the stove i say try it in you kitchen my only request is that they shoud come in a set 
biscuit cutters these were exactly what i was looking for the are tin and sturdy i also cook eggs in them to make them round for the biscuits ! thanks ! 
really sharp this knife is the lightest and sharpest chef s knife i have ever used i ve been showing off to everyone in my restaurant just how sharp it is i can dice half a potato into graph paper and it looks uncut until you touch it when i first got the knife it felt dull to the touch be careful it s not 
great fence system this is a great fence system very easy to use and set up our dogs picked up on it in no time the collars get good battery life about mo if your dog doesn t need a correction very often and the design of the wireless system makes it much more difficult for a dog to escape than an underground fence power outages are handled well a sudden loss of signal doesn t issue a correction to the pet this only occurs with the gradual reduction in signal strength as the animal moves out of range of the transmitter fluffy won t get zapped if the lights go out my only small complaint is that i wish i could still purchase the original collar that shipped with this unit when it first came out i know the newer collars are supposed to be better but the original ones used a much easier to find and inexpensive battery 
great vacuum this vacuum is wonderful easy to push and pull neat brush spinning hose attachment plus many more cleans carpet by just going over them once works on tile too ! just a great vacuum 
pet training mat i got this mat for my bengal cat tristan who loves to jump on my counters the mat has three setting low medium and high the first time he jumped up and landed on the mat i used the low setting he went up in the air and re landed on the mat with all four paws he did not go into the kitchen for a day and we bribbed him with treats at that he stood and staired at the counter but did not jump back up the mat has a mild shock on low and we have leaned on it ourselves and gotten shocked but it is enough for him not to jump up again on it it takes some time to break the habit and i have other counters still to do but it works great the only down side it when leaving on the counters everytime you need to use the counter you have to turn off the mat and move it i don t have a lot of counter space so this effects me more than some i am sure 
as good as the full size steamer i compared this travel model with the full size j steamer they were both very good at removing wrinkles from business type clothing we steamed a full week s wardrobe and the clothing done with the travel steamer looked just as good as the others the only drawback to the travel model is related to its small size it needs to be refilled every garments and the smaller steam head means that it takes longer to steam an item however i actually found that the small steam head worked better on small areas like collars and cuffs especially since it has squared corners the corners mean that you do have to be a bit careful with delicate knits though worth the price if you really need to look your best when you travel 
great for a gift and pets i saw these in stores last year and added to my cart last week with the free giveaway i have to say this has turned out to be a great toy for my dog ! probably not what it was intended for but she loves it ! thanks for the free gift 
it works perfect light for a night time light the light covers the entire room but is not so bright that it over powers your night time eyes 
astounding value i would not even say for the price this is simply an excellent very firm well made pillow for this sort of quality of materials and manufacture one normally pays several times this price and everyone loves a bargain 
napkin holder that works no matter the number of napkins this holder adjusts to hold them neatly and you can even fold down one side so that it becomes an l shape to hold a large stack it looks nice on the table too 
love the plates but they arrived scratched i m sticking with the lighter colors due to scratching my persimmon piece setting arrived with two dinner plates scratched i think next time i ll order them as individual place settings as they weren t packed well amazon will give me a discount for keeping them 
my favorite kitchen untensil i love my red joyce chen kitchen scissors which is what prompted me to give them to my sister inlaw and brother for christmas this year they cut perfectly and are in daily use 
great saucepan this saucepan is a convenient size it heats up well and maintains the heat the glass dome lids are great very sturdy and seems like it will last a lifetime the clean up is also very easy stuck on food and sauces come off easily with a little soaking and if that doesn t work the cleaning pad and bon ami cleanser finishes it off with little effort a great investment 
absolutely fabulous i now have these pillows on all our beds including our guest room it is almost impossible to describe how wonderful these pillows feel under your head at night without sounding gushy the feeling you get at least based upon the amount of water we add is firm and secure you never feel like the water is sloshing around these pillows do not flatten out ever and the fiber fill around the edges of the water bladder is high quality the first thing our guests ask after sleeping on them where to get them not often your can give someone the wonderful gift of a comfortable nights sleep all the positive comments from guests lead me to conclude that they are wonderful gifts as well and they do get oo s and ahs ! i have bought them pairs for my parents friends and other relatives and they all rant and rave the pillow cover is also very nice quality not like the ones you buy in a department store and it really does protect the investment the price here can t be beat since you will never buy another foam or feather pillow after using these i bought my first one in the doctors office for so its like you get two for the price of one 
mikasa parchment in reading the review i was surprised to see the comments about packaging and breakage i have been using amazon for years probably on a monthly basis i have never had any missing items or breakage i received my mikasa in perfect condition and it s beautiful for the holidays my only suggestion is it would be nice to buy additional place settings my dining room sits for the holidays and i could only buy place settings i ll have to track down additional settings elsewhere 
best waffle compo sandwich maker available we love it and it cleans easily you just pop out the trays and pop them into the dishwasher highly recommend 
ideal for pet hair the miele vacuum cleaner is already a substantial investment but i recommend the turbobrush for those models that don t come with one it s an especially useful add on for those with pets because the regular head does only a fair job of picking up our golden retriever s shedded hair i could just manage it by tipping the regular brush but this is not nearly as effective as the turbo the turbo rotates extremely fast sorry but the company supplies no specs on how fast and has longer more effective brushes to scoop up pet hair and any other kind of debris this model fits miele vaccums only but model stb vario s adapter enables turbo to attach to non miele vaccums with suction tubes that are between and mm one other note there s no storage cover in fact this one was not even wrapped in plastic for protection during transit however there was no damage the rugs look noticeably cleaner with the turbo as the brushes also tend to fluff them for more effective vacuuming of debris the difference is most noticeable on medium to heavy shag rugs there s one adjustment a slide that you push to one side when going over heavy pile the turbo head adds a little of its own noise a steady non annoying whirrrr as it speeds around it s light enough to lift onto furniture that needs cleaning the instructions which come in languages show how to remove hair thread etc stubbornly caught on the brushes either by cutting them away at the opening or by removing the cover and either cutting or pulling manually the instructions also include the line do not use on people or animals a certain ice breaker at your next social function overall i d recommend this as an immediate purchase for those with pets that shed or get a model that comes with the turbo otherwise you may wish to wait and see whether the miele on its own does a satisfactory job

this itty bitty book light is an itty bitty wonder i am amaze of all the negative reviews on this product i purchased the itty bitty book light containing the portable battery pack and ac adapter about years ago and i am still using it i replaced the light bulb for the first time replacement comes in the set i bought last year when it started flickering and died the book light has been used a great deal and i have accidently left it on for full nights before i am lucky that nothing has been burnt because the light bulb gets rather hot after about mins of usage this is the only down side i can think of the battery pack has its advantages you are free to roam with the book light but replacing batteries gets very expensive i prefer using the ac adapter this might be why i never had a problem with the light source getting dimmer over time it fits perfectly on big hardback text books and slim paperbacks you can easily adjust the light to shine wherever you want over the last year my boyfriend has bought at least led booklights and has returned them all because they were never bright enough for him and he could not easily adjust the light source to shine where he needed them he has been stealing my booklight to read with and i am force to use the poor night stand lighting the funny thing is i had originally bought it for him but he did not want it because it was not a led book light now i am on this page again to buy another one for myself 
great product this cuisinart griddler is great ! i ve had it for about months now and i use it almost every day as a single man i need to be able to make quick and easy meals i use my griddler primarily as a panini press now every sandwich i make is grilled on my press it makes a world of difference it s a great buy 
i love my mogu i love my mogu doll this is the third one that i have purchased i now have two and my sister inlaw who always wanted to steal mine now has her own 
miracleware popcorn popper purchased on the product was delivered per the terms promised it works my only problem is that it did not come with directions how much popcorn to use how long to set the timer on the microwave my issue is probably with the manufacturer not the store that sold it 
great electric kettle i have owned this kettle for several days and it is somewhat quiet the water boils relatively fast i like the lid which makes it easy to put water in from the faucet i have not had any problems with the kettle yet i would recommend this kettle 
comfy and cost efficient these bar stools are stylish well built comfortable and inexpensive a perfect combination when i was looking for the perfect addition to a small eat inkitchen 
good buy i love this banana fruit holder it looks tiny on the picture but it is really good size it is chrome finish and very elegant good price too 
nice dish works great and the handle on top is a much needed feature my old butter dish not fiestaware did not have one of these and that is how it broke by being dropped 
great espresso from a mid range machine after conducting research for a few weeks visiting amazon as well as other coffee aficionado sites i finally purchased the saeco aroma espresso maker and have been using it for going on two weeks although this machine may not be as glitzy in appearance compared to some machines it does make a great espresso say for instance if the francis francis is the sexy ferrari of espresso machines then the aroma would be a volvo boxy perhaps considered bland in appearance to some but solid reliable and a well built machine for the price once i got the hang of using the pressurized portafilter which has to be put on tightly to obtain the correct seal pressure i was treated to rich flavorful espresso with lots of crema i am pleased with the ease of using the machine however the instructions are not very detailed and i found technical support to be slow initially i placed a phone call to where i did not reach a live person but left a message never received a call back but called again the next day at which time i did get a live person to be honest she seemed ambivalent and downright unhelpful blaming my problem on the coffee i was using despite my best efforts to explain the problem the issue was that after priming the machine and installing the portafilter the pump would run and run but no espresso would come out i ended up tightening the three little screws on the bottom of the portafilter which seemed to help make it fit more snugly and achieve a pressurized seal voila ! perfect espresso if i had one complaint about this machine it would be that the portafilter is not very substantial and is made mostly of plastic the aroma s steam wand works really well for frothing milk almost too well as i ended up with a lot of foam but the second time using it i backed off on the pressure a bit and got just the right balance of milk and foam overall i am pleased with the performance of this machine its hard to find a decent machine for under but i would consider this machine to be a mid level machine for an entry level price especially with bars of pressure i had started out thinking i would buy the starbucks barista machine which was almost but after seeing a live demo at a starbucks store realized it did not perform well at only bars of pressure very little crema a good espresso machine should offer a minimum of bars two side notes i urge anyone who purchases an espresso machine to consider a conical burr grinder i bought the capresso infinity burr grinder from amazon it s crucial to have a fine grind for brewing espresso you ll know when you have just the right grind because after brewing the portafilter basket will contain a compacted cake of espresso rather than a soupy mixture of water and grinds i did not purchase my saeco from amazon but opted instead to get it from costco s website where it was for members or add or for nonmembers including shipping and handling plus it could be returned to any costco warehouse within days no questions asked if not satisfied 
sharp solid stainless style another beautiful knife from this series wonderful balance solid forge well built great edge stylish and practical fits nicely in the hand great contour quite handy when you need a smaller serrated knife 
heavy duty this cookware set is marvelously heavy making it easy to cook with and durable it s handsome substantial and you get a good variety of pots and pans i haven t once thought i need it s the kind of set that makes you chuck your old pans cleaning wise i did get a sort of rainbow mark at one point on one pan and so i put a very small amount of oil on a paper towel and wiped it off no where in the instructions does it suggest you do this and too much oil could make it tacky the instructions warn against oil sprays for instance but a few drops then wiping vigorously restored mine to that great stainless shine the stainless utensils and canister that came with it are great too 
easy to use i got this for an apartment with two guys who hate to clean i figured if i got a cool gadget that also cleans maybe they will us it well my plan worked perfectly ! not only do they use it in the kitchen but the bathroom as well it does a great job cleaning the floors they only thing i would suggest is making sure that you completely vacuum the floor first if your floor is heavily soiled like theirs was it may take some elbow grease on the first try after that keep up is easy 
great milk frother i love this product i purchased a nespresso lecube i wanted an espresso machine that made great espresso and was a breeze to clean up after i have had espresso machines before but i hated cleaning up the milk steamer and such and i prefer my espresso straight up so my use of a milk steamer was occassional this aeroccino is perfect easy to use easy to clean fill it to the line with milk choose the attachment to heat the milk or froth it push the button it stops automatically after a minute its easy to clean run it under the faucet a little dish soap that it no mess no fuss highly recommended especially as an accessory to the nespresso lecube 
great for dips i love this smaller crockpot for dips of any kind my family has food at every get together and having this quart crockpot is perfect it makes cleaning up easier too 
hamilton beach ensemble tall can opener red product is attractive easy to operate and performs well easy to detach opening mechanism for cleaning which is a real plus 
unfair rating i took a chance and ordered this quilt set it is much prettier nicer in person the colors are slightly darker tan back ground fabric patterns in blues browns w small pink roses in tan fabric i haven t washed it but it looks well made although not hand made very happy 
spraying ended love this product my home is home to four cats they mostly get along with each other and with the dogs however my cat china while sweet to humans is nasty to the other four legged inhabitants he began a spraying spree i would come home after work to find as many as half a dozen spots sprayed since using the feliway diffuser in conjunction with an additional cat box in a cat convenient location and thorough cleaning and treating with feliway spray of the sprayed areas i can happily say that in the last months i ve only had one or two spraying incidents china while still ornery is overall much nicer to the other cats and of of the dogs i can tell when it s time to replace the diffuser because he becomes a demon again 
wustof classic worth the money as a home user i must say that i m quite pleased with my purchase of this knife in the classic line had a few opportunities to use this prepping chicken already and i ve gotta say that it s loads easier to work with than the garbage knives i had at my disposal previous 
beautiful functional decanter i saw this decanter this weekend at a silicon valley kitchen warming party everyone watched with glee as this particular german s funnel sprayed the wine out of approx eight small holes at its base and turned this symetrical two bottle decanter red with my excellent benziger estate cabernet sauvignon the wine enthusiast aerating wine funnel with removable screen allowed more wine to flow around sediment and was easy to remove and clean this is made of a quality stainless steel and will last for years in shinny brilliance my wife bought a funnel at william sonoma the next week it has a small one inch stem spot welded onto a small screen it fell off before its first use i took it back and started my search on amazon the next day for the real thing i highly recommend this st class product to be purchased with this decanter wichmangaller 
best knives i have owned several sets of quotnever need sharpening knives quot and other varieties but this is absolutely the best set of knives i have ever owned they slice through so easily and with no mashing of whatever you re trying to slice they do need an occasional sharpening but that little bit of effort is well worth it also the knife extends all the way to the end of the handle so it won t seperate from the blade or break like so many others have especially while trying to slice through hard cheeses excellent knife you really don t need a whole set though as one serated and one straight would be sufficient 
great product i am very pleased with these sheets they are deep fitting sheets so they never came loose from the mattresss i gave them a of because i have bought other count sheets that are softer and silker than these but they are still much better than any lower count sheet and cheaper than what i could find at wal mart i highly recommended them 
no it s not cheap but it does everything it s supposed to do and it does it beautifully i have to put on my glasses to read the button labels but less subtle labels would detract from the overall attractive appearance besides the controls are intuitive and i almost have them memorized anyway this is a terrific unit 
much better than my last fryer mine has been great keeps temperature pretty well the heating element is much better than my previous it still drops temp when you put cold food in but that s to be expected as far as the house reeking of fish open some windows that s a circulation problem in your house not the fryer if you just fried fish it s going to smell like uhm fried fish cleanup is incredibly easy stainless steel looks sexy in my kitchen and i m very pleased with this fryer so far i had the same did not work problem but i just reseated everything correctly and it powered up again that was user error on my part would buy again in a heartbeat 
constantly in use in our house my thoughtful guy stopped off at a le creuset outlet and called me from the store hey i m at the le creuset outlet and you can have anything you want oh boy it wasn t even my birthday after consultation with the helpful sales assistant we chose this casserole it s large and flat like a skillet has a domed cover two side handles and it has the regular enamel lining the sales assistant claimed it was the most used pot in her kitchen i agree we leave this out on the stove as it s rather large we do a lot of things in it but recently we made swiss steak i am not a big swiss steak fan but when someone comes home with the wrong meat for the grill hint you braise round steak not grill it then you deal with it i hammered flour into the steaks with the cubed side of the meat mallet then sauteed the meat in the le creuset casserole i added minced onion a can of diced tomatoes and let the whole thing simmer on the stove though i could have finished it in the oven this goes in the oven at moderate temperatures the result was a tender swiss steak and with judicious stirring from time to time with a spatula to release the meat from the enamel surface it was an easy cleanup unlike teflon you do have to stir to avoid catching the food on the bottom i find that a nylon spatula shoved under the meat from time to time releases it well but i d advise you never really leave this kind of pot to cook on its own even on the lowest heat unless you have a heat spreader or even heat our gas stove seems to create hot spots under the surface so i keep an eye on it from time to time the cleanup is easy no abrasives or rough pads please but a good soaking cleans it up with a mild scrubbing nylon pad the cream enamel does stain from tomato and caramelized foods quick cleanup mitigates this but over time you will see some darkening this bothers some people but as long as the surface is intact we are ok with a bit of staining if you do a lot of skillet cooking and like le creuset this piece is wonderful and it can go from stove to tabletop because it is quite pretty 
sharper image soa genie automatic soap lotion dispenser extremely convenient practical and yet pleasant to view 
the best thing i ever bought for my kitchen i have a small one person kitchen with very little storage the hanging pot rack saved more space than i thought it would assembly was simple we only had to go out and buy the hanging hooks as they do not come with the pot rack and we had it up and functional in about minutes i love the lid feature on top of the rack it s so much more convenient than having to search for lids in a cupboard i bought two of the hanging pot racks and would recommend them to anyone 
excellent value i own several all clad pans i own the regular stainless and the copper core i also have a high end stove at home with powerful burners so i can tell you with some knowledge that this pot has performed excellently yes the rim sometimes is not the easiest to clean but for the money this is an excellent value and it has not let me down it s a bit deep but caramelizing onions is easy and simmering soup all day in it does not burn or gunk up the bottom the steaming basket is wonderful and the pasta strainer is something i use all the time the lid even fits my other all clad pans it may not be the same quality as other all clad products but i can tell you it performs the same 
makes tastey food burgers and chicken tastes great after cooking it on this pan can t use the round grill press though too big if you cook meat on the pan until its well done you will have to put a bit of water in it to soak before washing it can be difficult to wash but i still like this pan 
we love this french oven we were reluctant to spend the money on this french oven but it was worth every penny it heats up evenly and browns meat beautifully we use this qt french oven to make great one pot meals servings just last night we made braised short ribs that were mouthwatering we often use this pan on the stove for browning or searing and then transfer the dish to the oven for further cooking other times we use it for slow cooking on the stove clean up with the pan is super easy everything just wipes right out the pan is really heavy but that s what makes it cook so well my wife used to hate to cook i used to be the only cooking enthusiast in the family but she loves this french oven because all her recipes come out tasting so good 
champagne glasses i own reidel as well as spieglau the differences are slight the spieglau have a very nice tulip shape and the heft feel to them is very good and given the price if i break one i don t get upset as i would with a reidel no wonder reidel bought the company i recommend the spieglau to anyone looking for an attractive well made glass at a moderate price anything that helps you enjoy the champagne a little more as these do deserve to be recommended 
great product i love this pot it melts my chocolates perfectly every time i don t have to stir constantly or worry about the chocolate burning i have had this for two weeks and have used it more times than i can count i only wish there was a larger version also available i may try my crockpot but i am afraid my chocolate will burn i need to melt a lot of chocolate for christmas candies this will work great but because it is small i ll have to keep adding to the pot i do recommend this product i have already bought a second one to use for my white chocolate i plan to buy two more for gifts 
very happy i have just purchased this ironing board ! and so far it looks great ! initally i was leaning more towards the rowenta ironing board which looks almost the same just alittle wider but twice the price so i decided to opt for the cheaper option i was drawn to this product because of the under tray the only thing that i am alittle dissapointed about is that my iron does not fit properly in the iron stand other than that i am very happy 
great product for the price these mugs are one of the few oz travel coffee mugs you can find out there they are not top quality heavy duty but the reason i love them so much is that my husband only wants oz mugs but he has a tendancy to lose misplace his coffee mugs on a regular basis and i don t mind so much when they are only about each they are durable and he loves them too 
love this vacuum this is a great vacuum i bought my first windtunnel several years ago and just recently needed to replace it the vacuum is still going strong but i ve run over the cord a few too many times and the cord is starting to fray aside from that i m sure it would be good for a few more years anyway i liked my windtunnel so much that after shopping around i decided to replace it with the exact same vacuum it s powerful and reliable the only negative i can think of is that the hose is a little short the vacuum will tip over if you stretch it too far 
great machine for office life at work wouldn t be quite the same without this and my shots of buzzworthy however i do find it an expensive way to drink coffee the pods are expensive here in trinidad and so i don t allow myself the luxury of home use but for the office with no grains to worry about etc it s simply the best 
great buy this comforter is an amazing deal for the money while it does seem thin it is incredibly warm and works quite well if you are looking for a warm comforter for a bargain price i highly recommend it you won t find anything like it 
turned my month old rottie into a perfect gentleman i was very hesitant to use a shock collar on my dog so i tried everything else i could think of to control his jumping barking and general disobedience i worked with him myself hired a trainer and purchased an audio and spray correction device but nothing worked with two small children in the house i could not afford to have an uncontrollable dog maybe if he were a miniature pinscher or pug it wouldn t be a big deal but hades was going to be a to pound rottweiler when he is full grown that would be a recipe for disaster i purchased the deluxe big dog trainer from amazon at the best price available five days later when i received it i still did not want to use it after trying each stimulation setting on myself even at level it is not painful but it does command your attention i adjusted the collar and placed it on my puppy saying that there was an almost instant change in his demeanor would be an understatement he was a different dog in just a couple of days within days i only had to use the sound to correct him and now only a few weeks later i don t even need to turn the collar on he is a pleasure and i know that this product is the reason for his change thank you petsafe for this wonderful product i have already recommended it to my friends 
the best these are a purchase to go with wamsutta sheets my daughter likes extra pillows these wash very well and are nice and heavy duty pillow cases are usually expensive for at the closeout price i got a bargain ! 
def a good fan for the price i have this fan in my stereo cabinet so it will keep my xbox and equip cool on its lowest setting it does that not really on the noisy side the whir of the motor is only matched by the sound of the wind comming out of the thing so far no problems and is a steal for the price 
easy to use i reach for these first i ve been using these for a couple of months and every nasty gloppy mess i throw in it including shortening butter cream cheese sour cream and others have slid right out and cleaned up perfectly fine i spend less time cleaning up then i would have with glass as more is pushed out i haven t had any problems with them sticking and have yet to find a complaint with one and have gone so far as to aquire a cup version they both sit out and are never put away as my glass measuring cups are 
gift this was purchased as a wedding gift i have an older kitchen aid stand mixer and have been very pleased with it the box was damaged when the mixer was received however the mixer upon inspection seemed to be fine 
excellent coat rack i purchased this coat rack as a replacement for one that was similar in color and style because it had broken i couldn t be happier with the product i received and i am sure that it will last just as long as the other one that i had a great buy 
crispy cheesy pizza my husband bought this pizza stone and a peeler about months ago and we have had pizza almost once a week ever since the pizza has been crispy and cheesy and delicious in the neighborhood that we live in the pizza is excellent but homemade is really the best i strongly recommend this pizza stone to anyone who loves pizza 
the best i ve used it for a year now and i cannot buy a cappuccino at starbucks or any other mediocre place now the espresso in my home is the best you can get outside of italy we are even buying a second one for our summer house 
good basic coffeemaker for those who want just a simple coffeemaker that makes a decent cup of coffee this is a hard product to pass by the water filtration device is nice but not necessary in my household as i already have a filtration system installed but a nice option anyways the coffeemaker has a nice reusable easy toclean filter that i ve had no problems with and it brews in a reasonable amount of time the only change i d make to it is add a timer 
krups is always good customer below wrote that the tea pot gave toxic smell it says in the instructions that you have to boil the water twice before you use it to get rid of the new plastic smell most of the electic tea kettles require it i boiled the water twice and when i made myself a cup of tea there was no smell what so ever this tea kettle is very comfortable easy to clean and it boils water very fast this is my rd item from krups i just bought the convectional toaster oven from them and i like it a lot ! much better then microwave 
great pot my mother has one of these and really likes it so i purchased one and i too love it it is so easy to use and i have experienced no problems bought one for my sister and her husband for christmas and they also love it i would have to say the other reviewers were unlucky there are always some lemons 
not for frozen green coconuts do not attempt to open frozen green coconuts with this otherwise delightful knife unless you want to buy your friends a new one 
raclette grill this was a gift for my parents who wanted to entertain using this 
an elegant solution to a messy problem i am pleased that all my plastic bags fit into this neat little holder because it has freed up a whole cabinet shelf in my kitchen i debated between this wall mount unit and the larger unit that sits on a shelf i choose this one simpley because it hangs on a wall and therefore does not use any shelf space i wasn t sure that this smaller unit would hold all my plastic bags but it is actually the perfect size whenever i do a lot of shopping it gets really crammed full but since i use the bags for garbage it also regularly empties out you can stuff the bags and remove them from either the top or from the front my husband hung it in the utility room adjacent to our kitchen neat 
thee rack to have we purchased these racks for our theater department and were so impressed by how easy they are to assemble my th and th graders assembled them we bought some cheaper ones bad idea as they could not hold the weight of our heavy theater costumes this is affordable and i will be purchasing more thanks 
good waffle iron this waffle iron browns evenly and the browning scale is accurate an added bonus is its easy storage because it stands on end and will fit into a cupboard 
i love this skillet what i like most about it is that i am able to use very little oil for sauteing and i can use it in the oven for making steaks 
awesome dirt devil platinum carpet shampooer i shopped and shopped and read lots of reivews prior to making my decision to purchase the dirt devil carpet shampooer i previously owned the hoover upright shampooer and seemed to be happy about that choice for several years but i wanted to investigate what was available and what was out there before making a new purchase on a new carpet shampooer i read several good reviews about this dirt devil shampooer comparing all prices reviews and availability it seemed to be a better choice over the hoover and other machines out there i can tell you now that i have owned it and used it for months i just love it i have to agree with the reviews it is user friendly has a nice size fill tank and a nice size storage tank and they are both easy to fill and drain and the machine is easy to use and does a great job you can use really hot water and it fills easily at the kitchen sink it also empties easily too the only draw back i can see which other people mentioned in thier reviews too was that it is a little bit heavy however i think this is not a drawback but really a benefit because i think it really helps to clean and extract water from the carpet this machine really shampoos s nicely and extracts the water well from the carpet much better than the hoover i previously owned in fact the carpet seemes to dry in only a couple hours after shampooing i am sure this depends on the time of year summer winter but over all i am very pleased and happy with my choice i love this shampooer it stores easily it is easy to use and it really does a fine job it does much better than my previouse owned hoover shampoo model therefore i recommend it to anyone the dirt devil platinum carpet shampooer is an awesome machine it should last for many years because it seems sturdy at a great value for the buck in my opinion it is the top of the line in its class it is a great choice at a great price around 
great product works for me wow when i saw this light and simple design i was not sure what to expect i used this for an entire day working on a paper with my laptop it really did keep my lap totally cool ! it s light and comfortable ! i also set the lapinator plus on the couch with my laptop on it that worked like a charm too ! the underside of the lapinator never felt hot to the touch my laptop doesn t shift at all whether it s on my lap the couch or the bed this is a great product and worth the price in my humble opinion ! it s plenty sturdy without being heavy yet it is not flimsy at all what an achievement in design and construction ! 
good but could be better i got this pan because i ve been coveting all clad when reading reviews of high end cookware and because of the low price i figured that the low price made it a teaser something to get you prepared to pay the fortune you need to buy other items in the line it s a nice pan but limited on the good side it s hefty has a perfectly flat bottom for good contact with the stove heats evenly and holds the heat it is not non stick so i use it when i want the contents to produce the fabled quotbrown bits quot that come up with deglazing stuff sticks unless you use a lot of fat as noted by other reviewers it does not have a pouring spout the rim is squared off so the pouring stream tends to be very wide my other major gripe is that it does not have a lid all clad lids are pricey like everything else in their line i sometimes use a cheap tempered glass lid with it i still covet all clad pans but not as much as i did before 
great water lousy fit i ve changed out shower heads all by my little lonesome uncountable times over the years i cannot get this attached without it leaking at the connection to the pipe and what appears to be a leak where the housing screws on on the unit itself that said i still have reasonable water pressure and here s the amazing thing my relatively coarse hair is no longer coarse without putting any number of silicone products on it who knew that for all my life it was the water not my hair my skin is not as dried out if i could work out the little glitches it would be perfect i own the counter top unit in the kitchen and it s fab for the price ! 
outstanding hotdog cooker this machine cooks hotdogs like the ones you used to get at the county fairs the hotdogs are hot and the buns are hot i would not give up my cooker for anything 
a pillow for pregnant women i bought this pillow for one reason headaches i recently became pregnant with my second child and was advised to sleep on my left side which would be perfectly fine except im a belly sleeper and have the flat pillow that goes with it i literally had the same headache for weeks after i began sleeping on my side i chose this pillow because my also pregnant sister recommended it after using it for afew months it works great no more headaches from my neck anyway the reason i give it only stars is for two reasons it is heavy you cant grab it off the bed to lay on the couch when your sick or prop it behind your back to read in bed after our baby comes and im well healed and back to sleeping on my stomach ill probably pass this on to my husband who is even now trying to steal it and get a water pillow so i can have a little flatter pillow this one is nice and thick 
awesome product i bought this for my older cat who has no body fat on her it serves a dual purpose in that it protects her favorite chair from the majority of the hair she sheds but the best thing about it is the warmth it provides to her yes it does crinkle as the previous reviewer said that didn t bother my cat though she took to it right away the faux fur provides comfort and warmth and the crinkly stuff on the inside reflects back her body heat i rested my feet and calves on it one day while i was napping on the couch i can verify that it actually works in reflecting back your body heat my legs were kept toasty by this pad no wonder my cat loves it highly recommended 
excellent tool although this seems like an accessory that i could have done without i am very very please how useful this tool is it does a better job of picking up debris where the wall and the carpet meeting i also used it with absorb carpet cleaner in the past i was not able to get all of the carpet cleaner up but i can when i use this tool 
nice color this tablecloth is a little stiff so the folds don t really come out even after it s been on the table for a few weeks otherwise it feels like other vinyl tablecloths i ve had the color is light and neutral a warm beige with a tiny weave pattern for the price it s useful and nice looking i keep these on the table where we read newspapers so after a tablecloth gets too much printer s ink on it i replace it 
hard to find without amazon we ve been looking for this item for quite some time we had a set of these revere pans but wanted an extra sauce pan the size is perfect for everything from sauces to canned vegetables and sometimes having two would be a lifesaver but we were unable to find the pan without buying the entire set again anywhere but here the pans are wonderful and we d be lost without them 
great ice cream maker this is my first ice cream maker and this one exceeds my expectations it makes great tasting ice cream and with the qt capacity you can add lots of extras to your ice cream unit is built to last nothing on it is plastic it is noisy when you turn it on so i just put it in the garage when i m making ice cream so this really is not a big deal i highly recommend this ice cream maker 
i love it a complete set with serving chargers and flatware it looks absolutely beautiful on the table and well worth the price 
love it the knives we got for our wedding years ago had become dangerously dull no more ! i had been wary of ruining our expensive knives with a do it yourself sharpener but after reading the cooks illustrated review of this sharpener i was convinced it s great and my knives are once again nice and sharp 
yes i have wanted this kitchenaid for years now it was just a bit out of my price range but through amazon i was able to afford it and the service was fast we did have to return our first mixer b c it was damaged in shipping but amazon quickly sent us out a new one now i have the best mixer on the planet ! i love this machine my sister has had her mixer for over years without a problem and let me tell you we cook alot ! this is well worth the money ! kitchenaid is top of the line in product and customer service 
wonderful for your kiddos my grandson loves his comforter he won t let you take it off his bed even to make it very good quality and so very cute i would advise any thomas fan to get this one for your little one s god bless you all 
professional saladshooter great product easy to clean we purchased this mainly for grating cheese much cheaper to buy a block of cheese also many more varieties to choose from will be great for many things though ! 
wonderful and very large these glasses are really wonderful for enjoying red wine their very large bowls really help the air exposure that brings out the flavors in a good red the rims were thin and the stems delicate enough but they didn t feel terribly fragile also i thought the packaging was just fine there was nothing wrong with this set in any way however i wouldn t recommend these glasses to anyone who is a very casual wine drinker and wants to stay that way or anyone with very limited cupboard space when i have wine enthusiasts over they think these glasses are very appropriate when i have others over they think these are weird the bowls are much larger than your average red wine glasses expect to hear well i know the red wine glasses are larger but isn t this a little overboard of course these people don t realize that no the size of these bowls is great but expect to have to explain so overall in sum perfect for enjoying your red wine much larger than the standard size for reds which helps you enjoy what you are drinking ! if you don t want to have to explain the weird size to guests who don t understand red wine reasonably well or want to save cupboard space then perhaps avoid these and go for a more standard size red wine glass 
better than george i have been using the smallest foreman grill for some time and decided to get a larger grill i read the reviews on this and similar grills and decided to try one so far i really prefer this grill and have been using it exclusively it does not get quite as hot as the foreman which i like because the food does not dry out as much i always use the minute warm up as recommended the grill does not slant downwards like the foreman so the food does not try to run off of the grill when you open the top the drip tray is located under and to the side of the grill and snaps in a feature i like as the foreman tray tends to move all over the lid floats and is heavy enough to press down on the meat when lowered making better contact with the top of the meat sometimes i had to flip the food on the foreman to get the top side cooked in short i think this grill is superior to the foreman and i am glad i bought it i bought this at target as amazon has still not fixed my account and it has been several months i have bought many items elsewhere because of this and amazon is missing out 
cost and performance for a cost like that you got really nice performance and functionality 
great tasting coffee because this coffeemaker was unavailable for a while i was waiting for it with some anticipation my patience was well rewarded with some fine tasting cups of coffee it does take a little longer to make coffee than my mr coffee machine the cleanup is a little longer too but the difference in taste is worth it there are limits on the advantages of convenience however it is important to use a coarse grind of coffee if the grind is too fine or if the grind includes too much dust then the filter will clog the coffee then never makes the trip down the tube and just sort of sits there betwixt and between so just remember to use the right grind and you will be very happy with your bodum santos i also use a cory glass filter rod instead of the plastic filter included with the bodum santos the plastic one works just fine but the glass filter looks so cool the caveat about coarse grind applies to the glass filter rod as well try it ! you ll like it 
fun soup bowls save my lunch when the phone rings these bowls are ideal for spaghetti or soup and so many things i like the wide lip that helps prevent spilling and drippng i also appreciate being able to reheat in the microwave so often when i am having a nice bowl of soup on a cold day the phone rings and my meal gets cold i don t like having to pour it out of the dish and reheat it then pour it back now i just pop it in the microwave and i m back on track with lunch i chose the periwinkle color but think i should try other colors too they are fun to have around and easy to clean afterwards in the dishwasher 
it works i bought this because it was rated highly by americas test kitchen and it was available for a good price i have never owned an immersion blender before so i cannot compare to others the model i bought does not have accessories but i don t think they are necesary the reviews i read mention that this has a strong motor and the stainless shaft does not stain like plastic the only problem i have is finding a place to put it when not using it

great product for the price my son just loves this it is well made the material is soft and the price was great 
great bargain this set is remarkable for the money cups and saucers rather than just mugs and the quality of the fiesta label indicates how beautifully made the dishes are and cheaper at amazon than macy s 
i like it so far i just used it for the first time today and i made a very nice pizza that was very crispy on the bottom unlike with my old metal pizza pan it does take a bit more prep than just using a metal pan though read instruction manual but i knew it would be so it doesn t bother me i haven t tried cleaning it yet but i don t imagine it being too difficult make sure you get a pizza peel to go with it ! it makes things alot easier ! 
nail clipper for large dogs this is the best nail clipper for large dogs and the only one that s been easy to use for my dog with minimal stress to him it s sharp and able to achieve a clean smooth cut 
spa washcloth weight columbia towels are especially luxurious to use and for a long time i didn t use them because they looked so lovely and new hanging in the bathroom the color is especially pretty and reminds me of a deep lavender they call it plumberry the weight of the towels is especially luxurious and they absorb water so well that the towel at times can still feel almost dry after you use it when the washcloths are completely drenched they do seem a little more heavy than most although they have that spa feel to them and they retain heat very well which makes them sort of comforting i ve tried many towels and these are the most absorbent i ve found they are made with combed cotton and have a heavier feel the edges are sewn especially well with a nice fabric border so they don t fall apart the first time you wash them the rebecca review 
eureka quick up these little vacuums are the greatest thing since sliced bread for people like me who can no longer lift heavy things it is just ideal for doing my cleaning i am amazed at the pick up power it has i highly recommend it for anybody with sore shoulders and neck or sore legs and knees it makes vacuuming so much easier and it is just as efficient as by big heavy electrolux ! 
item before this one the item i received before this one which was the large spoon for the same type of stoneware sango nova black was snet broken but since it only cost it will cost me for than that to send it back so i guess i am stuck with it a disappointed customer brian stanford

no more doggy fueds with neighbor i absolutely love this product my neighbor has four little yippers and my shepard chow mix was antogonized by the yipping on our side of the fence i hung the device on my side of the fence and the noise keeps the neighbors dog from picking arguments with my dog all barking and fighting has ceased all the surrounding neighbor as well as me can get a good nights sleep now 
groovy kitchenaid makes the best kitchen stuff ! i have had this for about a year and it is still as sharp as ever ! my family eats pizza a lot and this is by far the best pizza cutter yet 
great sewing machine value i highly recommend this sewing machine i purchased it in january but wanted to use it awhile before writing a review since then i ve used it to make large drapery panels and it s been a wonderful machine several of the panels i made were lined and made of heavy fabric and the machine handled it well i experienced a couple jams on the really thick folded over portions but nothing that wasn t easily fixed this is the first computerized machine i ve used i was accustomed to an old heavy duty singer it felt very light at first but i ve grown to like that aspect it s much easier to put it away when not in use the machine was easy to learn it had a very clear instruction manual my favorite features so far are the blind hem stitch and the self threading needle 
love my misto i love the misto ! i have had no problems with it and use it often it is so much better than the chemical laden cans you buy would recommend this to anyone 
the garbage disposal is not your friend oh little piece of metal and rubber ! you make my morning latte yummy and frothy how i love you so if only you could stay far far away from the black abyss the destructive force that chews you up and spits you out ! if you need to purchase this replacement part and you have a disposal then buy a hundred this part inevitably ends up twisted and broken 
never going back my husband won t enjoy his morning coffee from any other maker we love chemex 
you can t beat raclette i first tried a raclette prepared meal in while visiting my fiancee s parents in lyon france needless to say i was hooked straight away although raclette meals can be heavy potatoes cheese and various meats and veg they are extremely good the hamilton beach raclette grill is great temperature control is a nice feature i have used it a lot since i bought it and recommend it good value for money and even has some recipes to try in the instruction manual 
nice design powerful tall design works well when blending deep drinks powerful motor chops ice quickly and evenly comes with kitchenaid carry on pouchnot much else to say about a blender really 
great for the office i ve had it for several months now using it daily and it s performed very well ! here is the deal with temperatures if you place a hot cup of tea coffee on it it keeps it hot ! not the burn your tongue hot as you drink the cup becomes less full and actually heats the contents more also i ve placed a half full cup of cold coffee on it and it heated it up to a nice warm temperature within a few minutes the heating plate will accommodate larger coffee mugs the only disadvantage i ve noticed with it is the counter gets rather warm were it is placed so keep flammables and paper away to be safe also it does not have a auto shutoff that i m aware of however i have it plugged into a power box with motion control so if i leave my desk for a long period it will shut off i also try to make sure the bottom of my mug is dry before setting the cup down on it to keep the heating plate clean so if your like me and like sipping on tea or coffee at the office with out going to refill for a hot cup every time your liquids get cold then you ll be happy with this warmer 
rival vsb seal a meal bags very pleased with the bags they work very well with the model vs seal a meal unit 
glad we bought the krups xp i tried buying this item on line from a major dept store days before christmas after they processed the order which included tax they told me it would ship on february th i cancelled the order and went to amazon com i had the item the day after christmas and we have used it daily ever since we are very happy with the purchase and are very glad to have it in our home we are also very glad that we bought it through amazon com 
blackbird the pillows came on time and were pretty much what i expected they were a good value and i have to say i like shopping on amazon 
upper back pains solved i spent a lot of time and money on physical therapy for my weak upper back muscles i ve tried all sorts of specialized pillows for years buckwheat pillows down feather pillows contour pillows memory foam pillows etc this was the only one that made me wake up in the mornings with no upper back pain it also works for my husband who likes to sleep on his side because the individual coils adjust to support the head and neck separately 
fun but not terribly practical first i d like to say that lodge logic is the greatest no seasoning could it get any better this is a great little pan that does a wonderful job at making perfect little cornbread sticks i ve done them in the oven as well as over coals and they ve turned out fine every time first time they stuck and broke when i took them out but the pan still cleaned fine the only reason i gave this a and not a is because it s not terribly practical it ll only cook one small batch at a time cups of cornmeal mix however if you want something really fun and different this is it 
great pan i have an entire set of swiss diamond in addition to this pan i bought swiss diamond because due to weak wrists i needed sturdy cookware that was not as heavy as stainless steel because aluminum is the primary affordable lighter weight alternative and one does not want food coming in contact with aluminum because of the possible leaching of it into the food i sought non stick pans with a coating that would not flake or scratch off and end up in my food after much research i discovered swiss diamond i have not been disappointed the pans are a great weight hefty without being too heavy and after several months of use the coating is holding up beautifully i confess that i do not primarily use metal utensils in it however so i can t testify about how they hold up against metal these pans caramelize food beautifully and the evenness of the heat distribution in them is a pure joy they do take a few extra seconds to heat up but hold heat very well i really love how flat the pan s bottom is and imagine if you have a flush electric cooktop these would be especially appreciated though i have a gas range i had trouble in the past with pots and pans slipping and sliding on the enameled grates but these pans do not slide and i was delighted to discover after realizing i had accidentally left this pan on low heat for an hour with no food in it it did not warp at all and is still in perfect condition this cookware cleans up easily and perfectly too i love that they are coated on the outside walls of the pans so any dried or cooked on food comes off the outside as easily as the inside one thing to note is that if you are looking for a pan to cook eggs in without oil this may not be your best choice the texture of the diamond coating seems to grab more than a slick teflon pan would and the first time i tried to flip my fried eggs without a spatula i had less than stellar results but with sufficient oil i can flip the eggs without a spatula or a problem i need to make my daily quota of coconut oil anyway for health reasons so i m fine with putting oil in the pan if you use a spatula you should easily be able to flip eggs without oil i do hope these pans turn out to be durable over the years so far after a few months they are aces ! in fact my husband may be growing weary of my exclaiming i love this cookware over and over again 
amazingly soft i bought this item not knowing whether it would be fit for a gift for my mother upon her opening the gift she wrapped it around herself and she just loves it ! she keeps it near the couch so she can curl up with it on a daily basis for some reason the blanket just jumped out at me when i saw it online and i am glad it did because it was great for a gift and now i want one for my own 
i love it i had bought my first fiestaware cereal bown sight unseen from amazon com and i absolutely love the rich cinnamon color of cinnabar the cereal bowl comes in handy and we use it for hot and cold cereal soup ice cream and leftovers smaller portions it s microwaveable too if you ve never used fiestaware before this would be a great introduction to the line especially if you have use for smaller soup cereal bowls 
very nice towels nice size good thickness and have remained color fast through many washings they have not puckered or pilled an excellent value not the best towels i ve ever owned but certainly fine quality for the price 
love it i have small children and i like being able to use the sanitizing steam on the floors which is nontoxic the pads are cotton and should not be dried in the drier because as other people have mentioned in their reviews they will shrink i think the cinch strings should be a little longer and the pads made slightly bigger to accomadate for easier application on the mop otherwise i love the mop and the ease of use and it really cleans well 
at long last i dont have a lot of extra money so i couldnt justify buying this while i had a handmixer that worked needless to say last saturday my hand mixer finally beat the dust meanwhile i did a little happy dance and bought this i do a lot of cookies that s my specialty the only gripe i had is maybe the bowl could be bigger so i could do my triple batches but whatever i cant afford a more expensive one just so it would have a bigger bowl i got to use it for the first time tonight on my oatmeal raisin yeah a little noise but not unexpected or scary there was a little movement too but again not unexpected considering how thick the mixture is i had to lift it every once in awhile to make sure that all the mixture was getting beat in but didnt really need to everything got mixed very thoroughly much easier than having to stand there with the hand mixer and fight with it i havent messed with the dough hook simply because i use a breadmaker for that and i havent used the whip because i really never have needed that either i am looking forward to getting some of the attachments especially the ice cream one and the meat grinder we try to eat as natural as possible and i am looking forward to doing ground chicken and other things i know its not an investment to enter into lightly but its well worth the money because i know this will last me into my middle age i love the heft of this machine also i am one that buys the most durable things i can i have a sewing machine that was made in switzerland and i can tell this is the same type of construction all metal 
rowenta ironing board cover zd this hard to locate ironing board cover was exactly as advertised shipped quickly it was a very satisfactory transaction 
very loud but powerful a very nice blender it crushes and purees just about anything i ve had it for three years now and it is still in great condition and still very powerful very loud ! you might need ear protection as you use this i often turn it on leave the room do something else and come back in when i think it is done ! i m not kidding !

better than sliced bread we were given ove gloves for christmas last year and absolutely love them ! they re so much better than traditional potholders and oven mitts the only thing to watch out for is that they re not waterproof so don t dip your thumb in the soup 
replacement bulbs i was so glad to find a source of replacement bulbs for my itty bitty book light and at such a reasonable price fast shipping too 
our cat barely leaves her mat we adopted a feral cat and bought this thermal mat because it can get cold in the garage which is where she lives it makes a tiny bit of crinkling noise when stepped on but she wasn t bothered by the sound at all even though she is feral and still a bit skittish the mat is made of plush cozy fabric and is machine washable our cat loves the mat and hardly leaves it on days that are a bit chilly it seems to really work because she also has a pet bed and a bed made out of blankets in the garage and she seems to prefer her mat definitely worth the price 
piece pfaltzgraff tea rose bake and serve set i use mine all the time it made a great gift and my sister really likes it 
great knives these knives have a good feel to them they are very sharp and i expect they will last a long time okay the packaging was a little cheep looking but that has already been thrown away i give the knife set stars 
decent bag the oxygen vacuum this goes in works great i used to think the bags cost too much but the first pack i got last me a year 
topsy turvy i haven t used them yet will use them soon they look great though and come with good instructions 
best coffee grinder i ve ever had i had a cuisinart grinder prior to this one and there s no comparison the cuisinart was noisy finicky and failed after about a year this grinder is as quiet as any grinder i ve ever heard anywhere and works great 
does just what it says it does i ve owned my duet for well over years and i m a bit baffled by the negative reviews i m reading here at amazon perhaps cuisinart has produced a few lemons i ve had absolutely no problems with it and it hasn t even hinted at breakage cracking or anything else i use it several times per week both blending and food processing and overall i m very satisfied combining a powerful motor with the dual functions of processing and blending is a natural idea and works well switching between blending and processing is quick and easy and the pieces fit well together with no leakage and seamless operation the base houses the power and the duet really does blend as well as any blender i ve ever used including the waring pro the buttons are flush and seamless with the display background so cleanup is easy and the base is heavy solid and will not tip over easily the blender blades are sharp so handle and wash them with care the processor bowl is a bit small and is good for small and medium sized tasks such as making salsa pesto sauces tapenade etc the shredder slider insert works like a charm and i ve used it mainly for vegetables and cheeses the placement is just about perfect and although others have complained that the feeding tube is too small i ve never had a problem inserting everything anything into it and obtaining the desired results it s really pretty logical any gripes besides the processor bowl being small my main complaint concerns the number of speed selections the selections go from stir to chop to ice crush to food processor and the difference between chop and ice crush is a huge one i would prefer that there be an intermediate speed that allows for a quick blend with less of a danger of pureeing the blender s contents than if ice crush or food processor is selected since all the speeds apply to both blending and processing this would be a logical improvement another improvement would be a better fitting clear plastic insert to the blender lid mine is too loose and considering this is placed over rapidly gyrating liquids a tighter fit would give me more confidence that i m avoiding flying food again i ve had no reliability durability issues with the duet other than a couple of minor design flaws i enjoy using it regularly here are a few tips that might help you enjoy your appliances for a longer period although many companies claim their products are dishwasher safe it s better to hand wash as many pieces as is logical in this case hand wash the blender blade mechanism doing so will maintain the sharpness of the blades and the plastic attachment pieces will fit better longer and won t crack or break use hot soapy water and a mild detergent pieces like the processor and blender bowls should be sanitized in the dishwasher handle your appliances with care don t toss them around or bang them against other objects store them carefully by avoiding piling things on top of them or shoving them into too small spaces put pieces and attachments together carefully if possible roughly cut up your food prior to processing and blending this will assist in achieving the desired results and will avoid problems like unprocessed lumps inconsistent blending or sudden bursts within the food bowl it also reduces the need to stop the machine and scrape the sides don t just shove the food in turn it on and expect great results remember these are not commercial grade appliances and as another reviewer has mentioned even if they were a professional would not abuse his her equipment treat your appliances well and they ll do the same for you the cuisinart smartpower duet is no exception recommended 
versatile chip and dip this chip and dip is on my bridal registry but i received it early as a birthday gift i just love it ! during the holiday s i used it for shrimp and cockail sauce i actually got several complements on the piece who compliments bowls anyway it is just so beautiful almost too nice for plain ole chips ! 
simply amazing cookware i was so excited to receive my new cookware after reading others reviews and how much they recommended this set i must fully agree with them it is beautiful quality and easy to clean cookware ! i am very pleased with it and hope it lasts for a long time also the price can t be beat 
godinger glasses just as promised all arrived in perfect condition due to exceptional packing the weight is really nice i liked them so much that i ordered a second set for everyday 
pur water it s hard to find replacement filters for my pur pitcher yet i found them easily at amazon com and i couldn t have been happier not only did i find my product but the price was so good that i ordered up a goodly supply ! i find i m relying more and more on amazon com to purchase the items that are sometimes hard to find elsewhere keep up the good work 
very pleased with table love it ! great addition to my home i just received my table and do have to say that i am empressed to tell you the truth after reading the other reviews i was quite skeptical about purchasing this table like the hard headed person that i am i went ahead and purchased it anyways i didn t know what to expect when it first arrived i read about how some people received only the table top or others received only the base i was extremely happy to see the delivery man carrying both packages some people also mentioned that once they opened the boxes pieces of the table were damaged broken after throughly inspecting all pieces the only damage that i was lucky to receive is a slight tiny scratch on the table top which i can fix i am very satisfied with my table i wish the best of luck to the next person that purchases it i hope my review was helpful 
very pretty crystal glasses the pictures don t do justice to these glasses they are really very pretty made in germany and etched crystal there are three separate etchings on each glass a flower bee and butterfly i paid less than for these glasses with super saving shipping because they were part of a for special being run by amazon they are very much worth that price the only reason that they don t get five stars is that they are a little smaller than i thought they would be i intended for them to be used as water glasses which they can be but they just could have been a little bigger 
good find how can you rate a tamper well it fits in the basket and it tamps down the coffee i guess terry s tamper does just that it was a great price i mean come on who s the numbskull who would pay for an item to tamp his grounds i was impressed by the fast shipping and great customer service 
icecream maker helped family reunion be a success we enjoyed using this icecream maker very much it froze the icecream in under minutes the instructions were clear and the icecream delicious all the kids had a turn at the crank handle and it was fun like grandma s old summer reunions only problem we had was in setting it up a small metal burr kept the handle from cranking properly but a bit of time and muscle got it working perfectly 
what happened to the other color i have one in a dark color i can t find anymore anywhere anyone know if they stopped making the other color 
best knife ever i ve been a german knife snob for years but this inch chef s knife by japan s global is the finest blade i ve ever owned period maybe it s not as easy to sharpen as a wustof or a henckel but then again it holds its edge ten times longer ive spent ten years and hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of dollars collecting german steel global is so good that it has me thinking of starting all over again 
heavy weight guest towels columbia towels are especially luxurious to use and for a long time i didn t use them because they looked so lovely and new hanging in the bathroom the color is especially pretty and reminds me of a deep lavender they call it plumberry the weight of the towels is especially luxurious and they absorb water so well that the towel at times can still feel almost dry after you use it when the washcloths are completely drenched they do seem a little more heavy than most although they have that spa feel to them and they retain heat very well which makes them sort of comforting i ve tried many towels and these are the most absorbent i ve found they are made with combed cotton and have a heavier feel the edges are sewn especially well with a nice fabric border so they don t fall apart the first time you wash them the rebecca review 
great for a long winter s nap i bought one of these duvet covers and liked it so much i went back and bought another for my mother she loves hers too i found the description to be accurate and the fabric to be of high quality i would enthusiastically recommend this product and at this price it s a steal 
super frother this gadget really works warm up some milk whip it with the frother and if you let it stand for a minute the froth will hold up very well when you add the milk to your espresso or coffee the only reason to give this less than stars is that i had to return one i ordered because it arrived with the frother rod separated from the housing since it couldn t be put back together i had to return it 
great buy love the way the mattress pad works no leaks but even better it s comfortable and quiet no crinkly sounds like a vinyl cover very comfy and unnoticable ! only reason i gave it a and not a was washing when removed from the washer it s very heavy i was afraid to dry it although it did dry fine so no concerns there either 
stops the bark seems to work for my little pug he was really scared when he was zapped the first few times but now he wont bark when the collar is on and when he s not wearing it he barks less 
so glad we bought this fence i had my doubts that this fence would work for us we have large rotties and i didnt think it would contain them the collars make a beeping sound that warns the dog to get back before any shock happens i am amazed our dogs will not cross the border and if they hear the beep they run backwards in fear i would say the amount of shock the dog receives seems a little harsh but it really puts the message across we also like the fact that you can adjust the amount of area depending on our needs 
works great works great the doser is kind of a pain sometimes but totally manageable it does a great job on the grinding and that is why i bought it bought this with the gaggia carezza and together they make great espresso 
tuffy says first choice from my toy basket our bichon chooses almost daily from his toy basket the toys he wants to play with the minute he saw this little red dog he was very pleased we like the terry finish and the rope middle our little guy is pretty rough on his stuff this toy seems to be holding up 
a little extra effort but well worth it i have to start by saying i got a great deal on this machine i already wanted one and the bodum store in dallas was closing so i got it for off along with a grinder and other bodum goodies i have to agree with other reviewers issues with cleaning it is a bit of a pain but i ve found that a bottle cleaner with just a sponge tip no scrubber it scratches works just fine i put the funnel in the dishwasher about once a month i ve found that the grounds will dry faster and be easier to clean out of the funnel when the coffee isn t piled on the filter before brewing its unfortunate that it s been discontinued but i m happy i have one 
excellent and comfortable one of a kind reading pillow the bedlounge has so many useful features i especially like the movable lumbar pillow adjustable headrest and the longer arms that make getting in and out easy and i love the ability to remove and wash the cover a truly outstanding product i did extensive research and realized the bedlounge is the best in the reading pillow market with the quality price and excellent customer service great holiday and birthday gift 
think quotout of the box quot fill the ramekin with a dip and place in a matching coordinated lecreuset oval casserole dish filled with chips or veggies nice presentation 
fantastic i have had this product for a couple of days now and don t know why i never tried it before it works great and you don t have to cut cucumber or small potatoes i had seen the cuisinart on tv and almost bought it and thought about the salad shooter i am a single senior and do not have the need for such a pricey one but needed it as i am getting rid of heavy food processor but still wanted to be able to slice and shred should have bought this long ago saves space can you tell i love love it 
great machine after borrowing my finances grandmother s ronco i bought this unit i couldn t be happier it does a great job fast no tray rotating or swapping easy clean up makes great jerky fruits etc inexpensive and powerful highly recommend 
makes a nice gift very good quality blown glass although i found out that the ball top that s shown in the picture didn t come with the decanter either false advertisement or amazon messed up 
fantastic reading light i love this light ! i spend hours reading in bed each week and this light is just perfect since it shines a perfect amount of light over the book w o disturbing my husband it s also a real treat never having to worry about replacing lightbulbs like most other reading lights couple it with the electric adapter and you have a reading light with no maintenance 
super knives i received three global knives for christmas last year from my son i can t believe how great they are almost a year later and all three are as sharp as they were when i received them i would highly recommend them to anyone who is serious about the kitchen yes they are expensive but they are probably the last knives you will ever have to buy 
very happy customer fast service ! they had the exact item in the color that i wanted cheaper than the stores that i had been dealing with i never have to leave the house to shop again 
allergy sufferer this is a great product i love the automatic function where it senses the condition of the air and adjusts the fan speed accordingly since i placed this in our bedroom the dust accumulation is about gone we also sleep so much better and feel rested in the morning i would not hesitate to buy this purifier again it is made with such outstanding quality and so very quite 
very pretty design though these are a little heavy they are extremely versatile looks great in the kitchen and well as on the dining table if you want to serve in them one note of caution the yellow is lighter than in the picture shown it has more of a hint of light greenish yellow but nevertheless looks wonderful 
a fan furever this is one amazing tool we went from vacuuming times a week to once a week we simply can t believe the difference the dog seems to love it too i don t have to work on him as long or hard or often as i did with the standard rake i am a fan furever 
overall a great machine good points heats up to the right temperature relatively quickly makes a great strong cup of espresso with great crema i have been using the lavazza gran crema e se pods never tried with ground espresso because i am trying to avoid a mess mine takes about seconds to go from espresso temperature to the hotter frothing temperature as opposed to the one or two minutes other machines take it really does froth a nice thick froth nothing runny and flimsy like every other cappucino maker i have ever had you can pretty much brew one shot after another with a few short seconds in betweeen to allow boiler to heat up the water to the right temp the consistency of brewing temperature is really very satisfactory and stable you can make hot chocolates and tea with the frother and hot water coming from the frother respectively nice for a couple drinks at a time and a lot quicker than boiling a kettle for tea obviously it is a beautiful piece and you will definitely notice it gets commented about looks good in a modern kitchen but is also just as comfortable in stainless pastel pink cream or white in a shabby retro or country romantic kitchen the clean up is a total breeze if you are using e se podsnot sogood points the water resevoir will need to be refilled if you make longer or taller drinks like lattes and americanos especially if you are making drinks for two or more in a household if you prefer straight espresso shots and those topped off with a nice scoop or two of frothed milk you re in business and can go for three days or more without re filling otherwise be prepared to refill daily the cup warmer on top of the machine is not really hot enough to keep the cups warm unless you turn the machine on for a good or minutes before brewing with the cups on top but it is a cute place to store the cups and i never really had problem drinking espresso from a room temp cup anyway have you just a small thing i noticed really but something i thought could be pointed out just to note i bought mine off ebay from the outlet refurbished and have had no problems it came with a mos warranty and i saved hundreds if you cannot come up with bucks for one this is the way to go happy brewing and lattes of love 
such a cute kitchen gadget i have to admit from the beginning that i am a sucker for cute kitchen items wedgey definitely fits into that category although it works great as an egg slicer as well it makes a nice gift too 
grrreat this is a great dealk and i am very happy with the performance of this set would certainly purchase from pinzon again 
a godsend for a household engineer okay so i researched products and prices for the last six weeks searching for what i eventually discovered was this little beauty ! i have copd and am not strong and i have a kennel of ten dogs and live rurally with all that dust it is imperative that my house be dirt and dust free i needed this to go over the kitchen floor twice a day to pick up any hair dust dog toenails whatever it is magnificent ! hey it s not my oreck but i found that i couldn t use the oreck on the vinyl flooring because it was causing static electricity and the short hair would stick to the floor and not come up the product got it up it is very lightweight and did a marvelous job what a great buy ! amazon carried it cheapest via allergy be gone one drawback cord a cord would be so much better but i will manage 
good quality but wouldn t recommend for top bunk i bought this mattress pad for my yrold son who sometimes had accidents in the bed at night the pad is of good quality it adds coushin to the mattress and it has never leaked for us i also bought one for my older son s bed which is the top bunk and it s really difficult to put it on his mattress it s quite a workout so i would not recommend it for loft beds or bunk beds 
the best wine opener my husband drinks a lot of wine so any wine opener really gets a workout at our house this is the second vacu vin winemaster corkscrew we ve had and it s worth every penny of its price tag we ve had many other types of wine openers and they had to be replaced every few months the vacu vin winemaster has lasted for over six years so far 
great for bathroom doors i generally leave my dirty laundry in the bathroom when i take them off i know a bad habit so i always have a dirty bathroom i hung this from a hook at the top of my door and place all my dirty laundry in it when i take them off it works great ! 
love it this thing is great its big it s metal and its red ! what can you really say about a coffee maker it works and it looks great in my kitchen no problems whatsoever 
wonderful gift lazy susan i recently got married and for one of my wedding gifts i got a pretty expensive inch solid wood lazy susan well when i moved into my house with my husband my mother saw it and fell in love she went on on and on about how she would love to have one for parties to put cheeses and crackers and for different things well they are usually pretty expensive and i was not able to find one cheap my mom s birthday came up and i was able to find one using amazon com not as big but as nice i was able to send it to my mom and she loves it she uses it all the time and it stays out on the table so the grandkids can use it to choose treats great gift idea this item is awesome and is better then mine it came already treated i had to pre treat mine since it being wood my mom just adores it 
overall satisfaction with this product very powerful steam concentration high capacity for accomplishinglong time usage for the job great attachments very fairly priced excellent overall satisfaction 
pretty and functional these are gorgeous bowls they are my preferred bowl for baking and cooking i am very satisfied with them no discoloration problems and they clean up very easily and they look fantastic on my pot rack 
simple attractive works very well unique looking with the soft polypropylene body contrasting with the chrome distinctive and attractive for an item that sits in plain view in the kitchen all the time with normal bread in before lowering the bread sticks almost way out of the toaster making it very easy to remove hot toast to toast smaller items the plunger will go up even further to assist the slots are extra wide so although i have not used the sandwich cage accessory i can see how there is enough room to make a sandwich and toast it in the cage apparently a british idea and maybe something worth investigating i am doing normal toast on only setting bagels on and with the separate bagel feature they come out perfect ! bagel feature push a button on the end of the darkness knob so that the heating elements change their normal output to get the bagels just right the machine feels solid as if it will last a long time the cobalt blue color is more of a bluish purple in normal light but very attractive very happy with the machine the vendor that sent ours had it to us inside hours with normal shipping ! 
useful little bowls i have several of these bowls and use them frequently they are the perfect size for snacks i also use them frequently for food prep tasks when i m cooking they re a good size to hold a half cup to one cup of a dry ingredient and of course they are the perfect size for their intended purpose fruit i find myself putting fruit on the table more often now that i have these bowls a cereal sized bowl seems like a lot of dish for one serving of fruit this smaller size prevents clutter on the table especially if you are serving salad and bread on individual dishes 
ice cream delight excellent machine for an outstanding sale reconditioned price of current retail for same machine at williams sonoma ! amazon prime delivered it the next day wow how good is that ! machine has been in frequent use since arrival and most recently turnoud out the chestnut icecream featured in a gourmet magazine recipe the self contained freezing unit is so much more convenient than the other style where you have to devote a portion of your refrigerator to freezing the bowl of the machine in readiness 
wow what a kettle i love everything about this kettle the clear guide on the side showing the level of water in liters how quickly the water comes to a boil is astonishing and when it does start to boil the pot automatically cuts itself off the pot also cuts off if all of the water boils out the cord is short however to prevent tripping but works just fine with an extension cord if necessary this is a wonderful product 
indestructible ball my golden retrievers have not been able to chew thru these balls and love chasing them good product 
missing link plus my breeder recommended missing link many years ago for my dogs who were fairly young at the time and i began using it my dogs coats were always healthy and shiny with missing link as they got older and had signs of arthritis i changed to missing link plus with glucosamine it was a big help in maintaining reasonable mobility as they aged my oldest belgian died two years ago at age my remaining one will be soon while the old dogs are slower and stiffer they get around pretty well with the help of missing link plus with glucosamine we just got an active two year old and she gets missing link plus too i have bought it in one pound bags when i have had only one dog but when i am giving it to two or more i get the pound bag for cost savings i will put it in a one pound bag and freeze or refrigerate the rest until needed 
great for wheatgrass i just bought the omega i am very impressed with this unit i have been juicing the last years and this is the fourth juicer i have used the auger end cap and hopper are all quality the fittings are secure and quality the unit looks good it is quiet it leaves very little mess i don t have to worry about one drip hitting the base motor cleanup is quick i bought it to juice wheatgrass which it does a fine with grass the supplied plunger does work but using a carrot to push the wheatgrass down the opening is much easier and twice as fast the year warranty is phenomenal on all parts and labor i actually use my old centrifugal juicer to juice a glass of carrot juice and the omega to juice wheatgrass and leafy greens i believe in using two different tools for two different purposes if i were only going to juice hard apples and carrots i would not get this juicer because it would take too long to extract the juice from these i would get a centrifugal juicer but a centrifugal juicer cannot do what this omega can do namely spinach parsley and wheatgrass 
great product the six cartriges i recieved will last me about a year they make your razor smwll good and also do a great job of lubricating the blades the trick is to clean your razor every other shave 
wonderful i ve been using this board for about a month now and i love it somehow it makes my knives seem sharper don t ask me how that s possible ! but seriously the blades seem to be slicing through stuff like it s butter all of the sudden very nice product highly recommended ! 
so far so good i ve got two little ones a year old boy and a year old girl my first worry after reading many of the reviews was that most who seemed to be having success had cats under a year old well i m about weeks in and so far they are adapting nicely the instructions in the kit stated to put the litterbox by the toilet for a week then just take it away and put the citikitty kit on the toilet well after a day of some panicked looks and panicked meowing i decided to take a step back i put the thing on the floor and started raising it a few inches every few days i m happy to say that we just graduated to putting it straight on the toilet ! i m taking much longer than the kit recommends at each step as i am very determined to make this work so i m sure they appreciate that as well downside my bathroom has never looked worse there is litter flung and tracked everywhere but i would go through that for a year if i had to in order to ensure the next years would be litter free ! another downside is as others have stated there is no going back in steps ones the holes are punched i think i will be cutting my own much more gradually than the perforated ones i think the holepunching process is what will make or break this deal ! but as i said i ll go as slow as i have to i ll check back in a few weeks with an update 
great lamp after looking high and low for a lamp with multiple heads i was excited to find that target had this one i read about the problems people had with the other similar lamp and the problem one person had with this one but purchased it anyway as it truly fit my need my conclusion it s perfect ! the base and pole are heavy with excellent connections with each having about an inch long of threading very sturdy lamp that gives off great light three settings let you light a set of bulbs or the other set of or all of the bulbs great lamp 
seems to work great my cat has always been high strung and just plain mean she growled hissed slapped bit you name it so when someone recommended feliway to calm her down i decided to try it but i didn t hold out much hope i plugged it in in the master bedroom her domain and saw an immediate difference oh she still growls sometimes but she is much more loving and affectionate and seems calmer great product ! 
works perfectly i didn t realize that i had ordered the unseasoned pan until after it had been shipped no matter ! it arrived midmorning today and it took all of minutes to season the thing according to lodge s intstructions i then cooked a batch of cornbread according to recipe on the back of the alber s cornmeal box i left the pan in the oven to preheat and when the oven reached i removed the pan shot it with cooking spray poured in the batter and sat back for minutes the result was perfect cornbread the wedges popped right out of the pan without sticking at all the hot set up would be to have of these pans that would equal one standard cornbread recipe excellent ! and for only bucks ! 
my cats love it my three cats max smokey and charlie just love my new pet waterer i was a little hesitant to buy it because max just loves to play in the water and i didn t want a mess the first day i had it he sat and kept putting his paw in it but after that he hasn t played in it at all he loves to drink right from the water slide and he ll just sit and watch the water come down the slide smokey and charlie have adjusted to it as well and i think all three of them are drinking more water i ve had it for wks now and today i cleaned it for the first time it was very easy to take apart clean and reassemble it is so nice to not have to worry about my cats having fresh water i would highly recommend this product to any cat lover 
it s the right size i was looking for a smaller electric skillet this one fits the bill easy to clean i use it weekly to cook all kinds of things from eggs to chicken to fish great for small meals 
cute comfortable and lovable i received my mogu about months ago and i ve gone to sleep holding it ever since they really are nice to hold would reccomend 
great products used vet s rx to treat my dog s ear and it didnt seem to work after reading reviews i decided to try this after only week i noticed a considerable amount of change in her ears for the better would recommend to others 
i like it we had an ancient kitchen aid and i loved it but always had to store it in the cupboards since it was so big and clunky our daughter now has it and is happy with it we bought the hamilton beach mixer and i like it almost as much as the kitchen aid the best thing about it is that the mixer lifts up making things a bit easier the only slight complaint i have is that the medium to high speed is a big jump it s a little too fast for what i want most of the time another plus is that it sits beautifully on my counter 
save your stove and walls from splatters this is my answer to the invisible little bubbles of butter and oil that escape from the frying pan and later decorate the stove top and neighboring wall the splatter screen is lightweight which makes it comfortable to grab quickly and place over an active skillet and the inch size works equally well on smaller pans as it does on larger ones don t know why i waited so long to get one 
best home deep fryer ever this is the best deep fryer for the home that we have every had usually you have to have a fryer that is on in order to get good crisp french fries onion rings tempura etc but this baby does it on regular home i use the frozen fries and rings it is also easy to clean i highly recommend it 
love it if you have the drinkwell fountain this is a must have it is so great to go a week or so without refilling your cat s water 
black latter bookshelve i have been looking for a ladder bookshelve for over a year and couldn t find any in person at a store that didn t look bulky or have way too high of a price tag i wish i had ordered these sooner because they were exactly what i was looking for they have a very low profile so they fit in my space nicely yet they display a lot of items the instructions said it would take people to put together but i was able to put it together myself with no problem think ikea like connections overall it was the quality i expected and it looks exactly like it was pictured so i was very pleased delivery was quick and it came exactly when promised 
great whisk i ve owned this whisk for about a year now and i m quite happy it is pretty small but that s great for me since i don t make any large batches of anything it s easy to store goes in the dishwasher easily and it s as good as the day i bought it 
wonderful desk this desk is awesome ! it is made out of solid wood not the cheap pressed cork wood from cheaper discount products trust the saying you get what you paid for and for this case this is a good buy the shipping was fast it took about days to come by ups despite the box the desk came in was beaten up the parts of the desk inside where in great condition the desk needs assembly and the instruction booklet took a while to figure since it was mostly pictures each part was labeled well so it was very easy to put together and i did it with out using any power tools and it took me about an hour to finish the job the style of the desk is very nice for small apartments it sits against the wall and doesn t take up a lot of space i would defiantly recommend buying this desk especially if you want a desk that isn t bulky and solidly built 
great deal great deal and even better product lightening fast and easy on the eyes 
pretty cool device i really like this it makes great little cookies that my family loved it is fairly easy to use but there is a learning curve on how much batter to place on the forms great item 
beautiful hamper this hamper is beautiful with lively colors it also has a fairly large capacity however it is not extremely sturdy i wouldn t move it with the clothes in it or put it in a room with a child who is hard on her possessions that said it is a great addition to my year old s butterfly themed room and she loves the antenna wings and face on the hamper 
grrrreat jar opener this jar opener has never failed i love not having to ask my husband for help ! he likes it too i am ordering several for christmas little gifts 
happy i was very happy to receive the flutes in such a timely manner they were safely packaged and sent very quickly i had been shopping for these flutes to match my crystal wine and water glasses for a long time a a major department store while they were advertised they were never in stock thank you 
great bowls these bowls are really great i have been watching and learning about fiesta for a long time this was my first fiestaware purchase i will be getting more ! 
pretty good this would work better if it was more secure on the litter box it does a pretty good job keeping the litter in the box but my cat is pretty spazzy and knocks it off pretty easily maybe i m just not getting in on right though still it s better than cleaning up all the litter he would spray everywhere without it 
aluminum pizza peel very good quality for the price i m very happy with my pruchase and would buy from this company again 
best dustbuster yet this machine is way superior to the original and some suceeding versions there is no bulky cradle to fit the vacuum into for recharging just a simple plug in point the suction is powerful i have had no problem picking up dust hair christmas tree needles and other small debris with no bag to replace the machine is easy to clean the only caveat i have is that when using the dustbuster for the first time after you have emptied the receptacle try to keep it away from anything that might be blown away as some residual dust albeit a very small amount and air is emitted from the side vents 
braun kf delivers a pot of coffee very quickly only had it a month so cannot say if the filter will extend the life of the device 
hoover floormate overall the unit is very good however the newer model has spinning brushes which makes cleaning a breeze this one takes a little elbow grease but definitely does the job 
heavy beautifully made did i mention heavy all le creuset is beautiful you can hang them on your pot rack just ogle them altho they are also great to use ! this quart oval french oven weighs at least lbs i think the weight quality is obviously part of the appeal but if you have a bad back or are downsizing packing to move as i am the weight can turn into a negative also you should check around for price im pretty sure amazon had these at a much lower price a week or ago there also good deals on the main online auction site btw i have the citrus yellow which is my favorite color 
cuisinart mini prep worth the money this unit is worth the price i ve had it for about years now i don t have a need for a large processor i just want to chop and grind stuff in a hurry i always leave it on my counter as it has a small footprint its easy to take apart and the cup and lid will go right in the dishwasher top rack this week i used it to chop pickles and olives together for a tuna salad i was done in less than a minute try it you ll like it 
b d power mop i thought this mop was not too bad to put together i think that it is easy to use with the exception that the sprayer is not powered this is the best cleaning mop i have used though not sure what they have going on with those pads but it cleans ten times better than swiffer and even a regular mop head my floor hasnt come this clean since i laid it down the problem is finding replacement pads no stores carry them i called b d and they advised that they have been on back order from their overseas vendor and that i would need to order on line or through my local b d service center i did place an order for boxes per box of and will hopefully get it within a weeks time they say to take swiffer pads and wrap them around the mop oiy who wants to fight with that i will just wait for my pads using my swiffer mop in the mean time 
sheets are great i read all the reviews to these sheets after i purchased the sheets and so was extremely skeptical when i received the sheets the sheets are heavy very heavy i didn t notice a funny smell as other reviewers noted but i did throw them immediately in the washer i washed them times and then i was disappointed that the sheets were so crinkly i put them up a few weeks ago i needed another pair of sheets in a pinch and so put them on the bed these sheets are so smooth i really like them i have other sets that are thread count and i really like this set the best they do not hug my body and i don t get tangled in them when i turn around in the bed i was skeptical when i received the set but have totally changed my mind 
great for the money i don t understand why some reviewers say it doesn t sharpen i got this littler sucker with my chicago cutlery insignia set and it sharpens great just strokes every few uses just like one of the other positive reviewers said afterwards i can slice tomatos just millimeters thick with ease and virtually no pressure it s not a professional caliber sharpener and i don t know how well it works on non chicago cutlery blades that might have a different pitch or angle but for bucks it works great 
love it this thing is great i would give it stars but the stoppers that come with it are the same size it s great for most bottles of wine but i found that if the cork is a little big that the stoppers do not seal properly i put a bottle of wine in my refrigerator and i had to lay it on its side and it leaked despite that i love it 
great so far i ve had mine months and used another one for much longer at a previous residence never had the mold problem others have reported i love it the capacity is great and the nozzle is perfect for refilling bottles and never drips my only complaint used to be hauling it into the sink to fill but my boyfriend had the brilliant idea to leave it on the counter and use the faucet hose 
tips for lids if you have a tupperware item with a seal that will not fit just soak the seal lid under very warm water for a minute then work the seal on to the container and let cool this should mold the seal to fit properly onto the container if there are any other problems contact your tupperware consultant because tupperware has a lifetime guarantee i am also a consultant if you have any problems http mytupperwarecomkidkid 
pleased got tired of can openers that left little burrs or that were difficult to get started hesitant about buying a as seen on tv product but went for it works well amuses my toddler and the dogs overall happy with product hope it lasts 
miele s the bomb okay so it s hard to get excited about things like hepa filters or the vacuum cleaners and other devices they are used in when my wife concluded her extensive search for a replacement to our old canister vacuum and anointed miele the winner i was slightly less enthusiastic than she it s a vacuum cleaner it s just a tool for keeping things trim after a very short while i began to understand her admiration for the design and build quality of this particular tool the hepa filters and bags used are no less a part of this than is the vacuum itself if you tire of vacuums that are constantly gritty with the dust they stir up but don t quite capture get a miele if you distain the smell emanating from your vacuum s exhaust get a miele if you long for a simple easy to use and maintain system that even your husband will use get a miele use genuine miele bags and change your hepa filter as recommended the difference in cost is minor but you will be amazed at the difference in results 
melita black manual cofeemaker no muss no fuss no noise in the time it takes to boil the water i can have a perfect great tasting cup of cofee ! nothing to break down easy to clean 
great price an excellent pan i brought this and it is worth every penny of it i use it to fry chicken breast for chicken marsala and it can fit up to breast beats the old way of frying at a time i loved it so much and show it to a friend and she had me order for her her mom paid for it and now it is even sweeter 
good neck support i wouldnt say this is the perfect pillow i have been looking for but its almost there gives me good neck support its a good value for its price 
the best oven mitts by far these are the best oven mitts ever ! you know you hold on to a cookie sheet too long and you can start to feel the heat through the oven mitt well not with these ! i have tried so many oven mitts and i will never look further than the oxo silicone oven mitts i love the magnet too they hang above my stove on the side of the microwave easily accessible highly recommend them ! 
a good machine i bought this vacuum strictly for the basement where our home theatre is set up it was a pain in the ss carrying our canister up and down all the time so i happened upon this cleaner on sale at home depot for a mere i was initially skeptical at first i mean a vacuum however i purchased it anyway knowing that i would be able to return it if i wasn t happy the setup and assembly was fairly quick the instructions were easy to follow and featured step bystep illustrations when i had everything ready to go i decided to give it a test run and i was impressed i was amazed at the junk our sears canister was leaving behind as i watched the cat hair and dust swirling around in the collection bin my only complaint and this is common with bagless vacs in general is that you must clean the filter off after every use otherwise they tend to plug up and overheat the motor this is especially true if you have multiple pets or longhaired cats in conclusion this is a good machine strong suction too the attachments include an extension wand for above floor cleaning crevice tool and dusting brush the dustbin simply snaps off in a jiffy and the filter is washable replaceable this is what i like to refer to as a second vac when you simply want a machine on another level in your home without having to lug your main vacuum all over the place i ve owned it for about months now and so far no complaints just keep it clean and you ll be set also pay no attention to that one review below this is obviously referring to a totally separate model i m happy 
dogsitter extraordinaire i paid way more for this than the current sale price at my local pet store my bull terrier puppy had surgery yesterday and we were struggling to find something to turn his attention away from the stitches i put treats through the other side and only put one of the treat balls on the one end saving the second for later he did manage to finally dislodge the treat but even eating that took longer than his booda bimples so overall i m very happy after he finished the treat on the outside he had to find a way to get the other treats on the inside he s a bull terrier puppy and the large suited him well i did not notice any issues with him being able to handle it the material is durable and dishwasher safe so it will provide plenty of hours of fun and the quick convenience of the dishwasher highly recommended 
simple for one bought as a gift for my mom who is not tecnically blessed she found it simple to use for her liking the water did not get hot enough so we found starting with hot tap water and the cup of coffee was steaming hot to her complete satisfaction 
beautiful these little plates are so special i love them they add charm to my kitchen great seller will use again 
nice little spoonrest i was actually looking for a stoneware spoonrest but liked the pattern and price of this one and decided to go for it i m glad i did though bought several and gave as gifts and they were well received one person said that they preferred the melamine since they had a tendency to break the ceramic stoneware ones ! 
good product gave this salt crock as a gift and it met all of my expectations it was a nice size for the kitchen unlike some of the larger ones overall i am satified with this purchase 
pleasantly surprised purchased two comforters and very pleased with quality i comparison shopped extensively via the net upon arrival found website s description to be accurate comforter quality exceeded that of other brands advertised elsewhere at much higher prices delivery and e mail notification process was very good pleasantly surprised 
dog loves it but it needs a carrying case this product is sturdy and has plenty of room for my lb shih tzu it s easy to use and lucy loves it the only thing i wish is that there was an option to purchase a well made carrying case to put crate in when not in use and we need to tote it from one place to another for example i d like to be able to check it at the airport and feel that it s somewhat protected lucy travels on board w us in an airline approved pet carrier 
if you follow the directions this is an excelent roaster cooks quickly and evenly not as good at being a slow cooker as my slow cooker but it is wonderful as it was intended 
does the job better than some others my last back to basics blender lasted only about months but i bought another one anyways i like the size of the cup quite large i also like that it has more than one speed unlike some other blenders that are similar 
excellent cookware w style besides looking nice when hung from a pot rack this big pot heats up quickly cooks food effectively allows for metal utensils to be used and is simple to clean i especially like the long handle on one end and the short handle on the other makes maneuvering easy it is a bit pricey but i think it s worth it 
great replacement but be careful of the size when i received it it was half the size of my press ! their cup is actually mugs if your press makes about mugs of coffee then you need the cup replacement the cup did fit in my press so i kept it and it works great 
good value for the money the response time of this thermometer is pretty decent in its price range it goes from freezing to boiling or back in about seconds the measurement range is ok at a maximum of f you won t be able to use it for deep frying or melting sugar but it s more than sufficient for measuring meat pastry doneness all in all it s a decent choice if you just want a basic unit for everyday tasks if you need auto off or a celsius mode look at similar taylor models for a little bit more the next significant step up is the thermoworks really instant thermapen at a whopping sold under the name digital thermometer on amazon see bvwrcc 
buy it it really works it really does sharpen perfectly ands is also very easy to use it is also nice looking and sturdy ! great buy ! 
good starter juicer this was my first juicer and i felt it was a good buy i do not know if this model comes in appliance white yet but the black is attractive and it can be left out on a counter if you have all black appliances without detracting from the look of your kitchen the juicer was easy to set up and use even without reading the manual very similar to food processor it comes well packed when running the juicer the noise level is quieter than a dishwasher or blender perhaps not as quiet as a krups ice cream maker but certainly acceptable middle ground it comes with a cleaning brush that works well to scrub the metal inner piece that strains the juice i do wish it came with a smaller one to get in the spout of the juicer to clean that area a baby bottle nipple brush will have to do this is the only part i wash by hand the rest can be rinsed and put through the dishwasher if you line the pulp container with a grocery bag clean up is easy just take the bag out ! the pulp it makes is relatively fine and moist you can use this in baking or add it to your compost the juice container holds cups but it could be improved by adding measure lines to it i bought this primarily to juice for my year old daughter to help keep her palate open to produce tastes she enjoys putting things in the chute and turning it on our first combo was equal parts carrot and apple citrus seems to get a little messier than other items but it is still easy to clean up i would reccommend this to a friend 
much better than the usual target furniture it was a joy not to have to hassle with those stupid cams and parts than don t fit although the bottom feet which you do have to assemble had to be forced in order to fit it s also quite attractive i should pay more attention to the dimensions of products than to their pictures because in my mind the picture makes it look wider than it is it s nice to see real wood but i am under the impression that the pressed wood like the stuff ikea sells is more environmentally friendly finally you can t beat the price 
really great measuring spoons i really bought these measuring spoons to match the michael graves measuring cups that i was planning to buy and i am sure glad that i did the are the easiest to use measuring spoons that i have ever used the unique handles seem just right you can use them equally well with either hand it seemed with the dipper type spoons that i previously used i was always changing hands and the spoon was always in th wrong hand with these you can forget that you can tell the size of each of them just by looking at them but i wish that they would have embossed the sizes all a little larger and painted them white black on black is hard to see especially when the numbers are so small 
great buy i was hesitant to purchase these over the internet but went ahead anyway they shipped really fast and they are nice blinds i was very pleased i gave them four stars because although they are packaged pretty well when i took them out of the boxes the little plastic clips that attach the single piece over the top of the blinds had a broken clip in both packages i used the pieces from my old blinds i was replacing but for those who are buying them for bare windows it would be a disadvantage 
libbey glassware i own this pattern but in a light blue color is it possible to find this pattern in that color 
it definately helped each year we board my mother s cat while she is on vacation and each year so far she has gotten a urinary tract infection from holding in her urine for the first few days we also get issues with one of my own cats scent marking clean laundry and bedding this year my mother s cat never got a uti and we haven t had one single scent mark from the other cat it hasn t eliminated all the tension that exists between the cats but it definately makes the visit easier to bear 
works like a charm one of my biggest challenges in baking pies is to ensure that i don t burn the crust while baking the pie itself this shield really did the trick it fits my best pans and i don t worry about my crusts any more i also took another reviewer s suggestion and sprayed the inside with oil prior to placing on the crust and it worked like a charm 
grape paper towel holder this item was shipped quickly and arrived sooner then promised it is a beautiful piece and i get compliments from everyone thanks 
cup is exquisite and perfectly balanced in saucer i have this cup and am very satisfied with it the design is elegant and lovely to say the least i enjoy it very much 
coat rack the coat rack was perfect it was nicer than any i had foundaround this area and a lot cheaper was very pleased withit thanksdonn 
this one s a winner tired of a hot lap top the lapinator is the answer i highly recommend this item and i have thoroughly tested it 
great towel this towel is very high quality and worth the money the color is deep blue just as described 
good deal the brick sheets are a deep rich color i was not expecting much for the price but was pleasantly suprised they are super soft and silky smooth as with any good cotton they only get softer and more comfortable with each use good deal recommended item 
ball canning the kit was every thing that we expected it was delivered in a timly fashion very pleased gerr 
great laundry basket each of the compartments holds almost a full load of laundry the unit is skinny enough for a small laundry room it was easy to put together and slides around the room effortlessly i recommend this great price and great product 
soft with a good fit we are verry satisfied with our pinzon sheets we had pruchased other more expensive sheets in the past and these were just as good if not better than the fancy name brand the two things that were a deciding factor in my purchase were the free shipping and the depth of the pockets when the sheets arrived i was more than happy as they fit our pillow top matrice quite well and were ever so soft i was looking for deep pocket sheets and these didn t say that in the description so i was not sure how they would fit i have since purchased several more sets from pinzion including many of their plad ones here in alaska there is nothing better than a set of soft warm flannel sheets on a cold winter night they are nice in the summer as well 
attractive inexpensive for the price this wine rack is a good purchase once assembled it is very attractive and fairly sturdy getting the two ends to sit level was a little problematic and the caps supplied to cover the holes where the screws are inserted are plastic not wood which i thought was a little cheesy overall though i really like this wine rack and would probably purchase it again to give as a gift 
a very good garlic keeper this was even nicer than i had expected about inches high at the shoulder and inches across it is big enough to hold six full heads of garlic it came through the dishwasher okay and is more pleasant to look at than a clay keeper 
great filter great price i have owned this filter for many years and i have to say it is great i have owned others that were good to just as good but because of the price this one beats them out 
beautiful i am a big fan of the royal albert collection this particular piece is a beautiful addition to my collection i am quite satisfied with my purchase 
love these knives ! but never put in dishwasher well that pretty much sums it up great knife good balance and feel keeps an edge most of the time but never never never put it in your dishwasher this purchase was to replace my previous knife which went through the dishwasher routinely then one day we noticed the handle was warping and had hairline cracks all around the tang area so lesson learned and the warranty is only good if you don t use the dishwasher enough said 
good vacuum for the money i ve bought or vacuums during the last years they ve all worked okay but there was always something that could be improved upon this one had features that appealed to my personal needs number one was the suction power i ve had vacuums that had more power but wouldn t pick up a feather if it wasn t stuck just right this one picks up everything number two was i prefer bags rather than emptying a container no mess this model had something i d never had before which i find great and that is the dirt indicator i have a motorhome which i thought i thoroughly clean every time it took me minutes the first time to clean that small area to the point the indicator light stayed green i m happy with it now and if it lasts for a few years i ll have considered it a good deal 
cute candle piece i think these little candle holders are great for any occasion and they aren t expensive either therefore you can buy any color for any occasion to match any room in your house these can be used for formal occasions or just everyday use 
great but i needed a saucepan to cook oatmeal in that would let go on the bits that stick to the bottom sounds silly but i love oatmeal and hate cleaning the pan afterwards this cleans up easily and cooks evenly i have used it for cooking rice gravies and other foods that seem to stick and it always cleans up well now for the lid there is a black band on the inside of the lid and it scrubed off one night recently i sat down wrote an email to the company and by the next day they have a new lid on the way they asked only where to send it nothing else i like companies that stand by the product they sell so if you are going to buy from this line check that black band it should be between the glass and the metal not on the inside of the lid if you have a problem with the product always notify the manufacturer they will almost always make it right like calphalon did for me 
a gift for someone who has everything this bar set is gorgeous ! i received this as a gift for my birthday and intend on purchasing one as a gift for christmas it is dazzling in appearance and is not only functional but a wonderful show piece on my bar 
i enjoy using this crock pot the pot is very easy to use and food cooks perfect 
fagor splendid quart pressure cooker recieved in great conditon have enjoyed using it for soups 
cute and practical shape i have had this teapot for about a year and it continues to be my favorite i usually use loose tea and the paper tea bags which can be purchased empty so i don t have any problem with the tea strainer at the neck of the spout i admit that it does drip a bit but i use a matching square plate beneath it with a dark colored terry potholder to catch whatever does drip and even with that small inconvenience what teapot doesn t drip a little i just love the shape of the pot the lid and the handle i have arthritis so the handle angle is important to me a teapot full of scalding tea is not what i want to spill and the handle on this pot is at a very convenient angle making it easy to pour even when full most other pots have big round handles that are just not easy for my wrist to manage i also like the lid which has two ears when it is on the pot it won t fall off even if you put the teapot upside down to remove the lid it must be turned to allow one of the ears to slip through a little notch then the other ear will also come out easily it seems like a small thing but i ve dumped many lids to their early demise while pouring the last cup the shape of the handle on the lid is flat and a generous size which is easy for my old hands to grasp another great feature i prefer over the little balls that usually adorn the tops of teapots the pot also keeps my tea hot longer i m not sure if it s the shape of the pot or the material it is made of but i never use a cozy on it and the tea is fine to the last cup if i do let it go too long like hours i can slip the pot in the microwave and zap the brew to heat it up again don t try that with royal albert its a chubby little cheerful teapot that just does its job well i ve ordered another to give as a gift i m tempted to buy another for myself just in case 
excellent knife i purchased this for a gift for my daughter she says that this knifeis the greatest 
flannel bedding the colors are just beautiful and it is so soft it surprised me how much warmer it made my down comforter love it i will buy more products from this line 
my husband s valentine this pillow was purchased for my husband who says that this is the best pillow he has ever slept on his neck does not hurt in the morning with this pillow 
this is the best thing ebear i made lattes the beary first day i got this and loved it i think i ordered one as a gift for my friend almost immediately after finishing my drink she loves it as much as i do we both wanted a stovetop milk frother and after doing some research i went ahead and got this lovely set by bialetti i wanted to be sure it was awesome before getting it for my friend p i believe we both used it at our thanksgiving dinners and everyone loved the drinks too in about minutes of turning on the stove and the espresso is done the challenge for me was making the drink hot enough this meant that i would have to heat up the milk several minutes on a medium setting because i was afraid of burning the milk prior to making the espresso another trick is to keep the cups hot with hot water before making the drinks i read somewhere that a french press can be used to froth milk but i wouldn t risk doing it in glass with metal mesh there are a few other frothers i have seen with this type of construction this bialetti frother pot is nonstick and not only is the mesh in a plastic disk it actually has a double disk which i think really adds to the frothing i ve done a lot of looking around at various milk frothers in various stores and no other frother has a double disk pump if you add sugar to the latte it s best to add it to the espresso before the milk or else it ll just sit on top of the foam i love hazelnut so i bought a flavoring syrup which i stir in with the espresso before adding the milk and it s awesome i also like to add a little cocoa powder on top 
they re also finnish too my mother used to makes these for christmas and my sister and i decided that we must pass that tradition on to our children too for us it s not christmas without rosettes ! they are so delicious 
works great this replace one that was years old and also made by rival it will see a lot of use and works great 
sunbird i have one of these cute space savers i like the compact size and it does the toaster and toast over duties as well as the other big monsters you can see the bottem half of a piece of toast as it toast so the doneness can be monitored only real complaint i have is that using the level to eject the toast is almost imposible a considerable amount of pressure is need and the toast goes flying my granddaughter thinks that is great pulling the plug is the quickest way to eject the toast and by the way was the manufactures suggestion when i called to complain i also have a regular toaster and pulling the plug is the only way to get bread out early the oven does an excellant job of toasting my french rolls and toastation is so compact i am going to buy another for my winter home 
a must have for any thomas fan this is the cutest comforter not the softest buy my son loves it ! i hadn t been able to get him to sleep in his own bed all night but as soon as we got this it was no problem he loves to sleep in his thomas bed ! 
soft and thick these sheets are an exceptional value they are very thick and extremely soft the color was even nicer than pictured 
great silverware very good quality silverware we bought it to match with an existing set of henckles silverware this oneida is holding up to washings and little kids much better than the henckles has excellent product ! 
verry good very nice product some people complainted about the amount of noise it makes i really didn t notice that much noise maybe i got used to it really quickly or something buuut its really not bothersome fridge looks great and can be set very cold to possibly be used as a freezer not sure tho havnt tried yet only complaint is that standard beer bottles dont fit vertically you have the lie them on their side but thats really not a big deal very happy i bought this 
toasty turkey we bought this to use this thanksgiving for our lb turkey but couldn t wait we have used several times to raost chicken and it is great the chicken cooked faster than our cookbooks had suggested and it cooked very evenly clean up was nice too just a little hot soapy water was enough to remove the cooked on drippings we did a lot of comparison pricing before we purchased this item the price was right in line with many of the cheaper and no name brands that i had seen on sale 
great performace the wireless fence worked great for our mixed bread lab she understood where the boundary was within days the idea that the collar gives an auditory signal before shocking helped her to figure out her territory without getting zapped it allowed us to have the peace of mind that she will stay in our un fenced yard and will not run to the road 
great item having problems hanging your family photos this is the perfect product and inexpensive sooooooo easy 
attractive and handy i have two of these one in yellow and one in a discontinued sea greeny color they re attractive of course this is fiestaware after all but they re darn functional they re long enough to accommodate a london broil or small roast or kebobs and they re deep enough that any juices are not likely to spill while you re carrying or serving i like wish there was one slightly bigger too then i d get two more 
very good product the memory foam mattress was delivered as promised and i love the product i would recommend 
designed to be a vacuum you don t have to fight with the light weight compact design makes the miele vacuum cleaner highly maneuverable it can be easily picked up and moved up and down stairs when you move about the room you don t have to drag it around like a dead weight a gentle tug and the main motor unit follows along effortlessly it doesn t have a motor driven carpet brush at first i thought it would be a disadvantage after all that s a standard feature on most of the american vacuum cleaners but now i see the logic behind it the standard floor tool is lighter and easier to move around its joint swivels in two directions making it easier to get into corners and under furnitures the hose also doesn t have embedded electrical cable making it more flexible for our carpet the standard floor tool works well enough the manual does recommend getting the battery powered electro brush if really deep pile carpet or rug neccesitates it the motor is powerful yet very quiet overall this is a excellent cleaning tool that makes vacuuming less of a chore 
corelle dishes i ordered sets so i would have a service of it is hard to find dishes with true red on them i have looked every where i was happy to find these 
so far so good this item has broken on a few people so i will update this review if it breaks so far i really like it the only reason it gets stars is because it seems a tad tall for no real reason otherwise it is great the grind indicator works well once you get a feel for it although you can do about as well by looking at the grinds yourself as it is grinding it is also nice that is has a skinny middle coated with rubber so it is easy to hold without slipping i guess making the skinny middle part may be why it is a bit tall the look is realy cool and the wind up cord is great too ok the update three years later in this thing is still going strong despite my dumping boiling water in it to clean it and doing other non manufacturerapproved stuff to it two thumbs up 
table top wine chiller a great alternative to sticking a wine bottle in the freezer and then forgetting about it 
great organizing tool i got this out of frustration of trying to find places to charge all of our gadgets we had cords and gadgets everywhere ! two pdas two cell phones an ipod and a bluetooth earpiece this item has helped us get organized tremedously pros nice sturdy wood and velvet trim has a door in the back with holes on each end for you to choose which side you want the power strip cord to come out two extra slots in the door allow for cords to come through as well also comes with two plug extenders that allow you to plug in those chunky transformer type chargers cons almost all of my chargers have those chunky transformer type chargers so i have to plug one charger into a regular outlet and run the cord through the slots i could have used probably more of those plug extenders b c the transformers cover up the plugs on the power strip maybe you can find some at an electronic store to solve this problem it is also a little cumbersome to set up but in the long run it pays off to have everything hidden and organized i would highly recommend this product 
versatile why worry about where you are going to store that china to be used only on special occassions while this simple but elegant pattern can be used on special occassions and holidays it is durable enough to be used on a daily basis 
best one so far i have used others but so far this was the best one and easy to use my sister used it and she loved it so i ordered one for her also highly recommen 
good value heats well and quiet does not blow heat very forcefully but certainly warms sufficiently given enough time using the oscillation function appears solidly built with good warranty 
one of my boys bought this and this is a great shower curtain it resists stains and it pretty well made specially for the price 
great icecream maker i have owned this icecream maker for a few months now its great way to prepare homemade delicious icecreams its available at costco for its noisy but it makes great icecream in less than minutes just like other icecream makers from cuisinart the consistency of the icecream is like a soft serve so if you like you can keep the prepared batch in the freezer for few hours this item is definitely a great gift for icecream lovers enjo 
works well enough this sharpener does not work with a thick blade however it is fantastic for your thinner bladed knifes steak pocket paring everyday chopping knifes come out very sharp the only complaint i have is after going thru the initial sharpening stage using the second and third wheels result in kicking out the blade about way thru similar to a table saw kicking out lumber back at you mine is new and has only seen use once all of my knifes and i don t know if there s a breaking in period it ll be awhile before i use it again because it works quite well but for now i would recommend it 
beautiful dining set my husband and i bought this dining set while being a little worried about some of the previous reviews about delivery problems cracks etc however we were pleasantly surprised when the table arrived in perfect condition it took us abt two hours to put it together but it was not difficult at all we have had it for about two weeks now and so far so good ! it s a very nice looking classy table and the color is so rich and elegant 
fantastic dishes love these dishes my family has them at our summer cottage original ones of course and that i can buy the reissues for my house and at such a great price is fantastic great prices and no problems with the shipping 
great juicer times manual don t describe trick of cleaning review this juicer is a great juicer and if you know the trick to cleaning it well its a snap and makes this juicer a realy great juicer first off it is very quiet while juicing and is juices very smoothly no shimmying across counter top like some customers have stated of other juicers it does not foam up and i have been able to juice over a gallon of juice with only having having to spend second to lift out baket scoop out the pulp and reassemble the juicer before you are off again the citrus fruit juicer attachment which is included at no extra cost is well made with two sizes to juice large and small citrus fruit it has safety features that will insure safe opperation while juicing citrus fruit some other brand juicers will require you to purchase the juicer attachment at an additional price the citrus fruit stainer is so great you could can juice boxes of citrus fruit while only having to stop and empty the citrus strainer after every about medium peaces of citrus fruit for cleaning it comes apart very quickly without any difficulty there is only two peices too take apart from the base unit after spending many hours of researching the specs of different juicers out there then reading several customer reviews for many of the juicers sold by amazon com i decided to purchase this kitchenaid juicer and there was only one negative review concerning the kitchenaid dual function juicer about difficulty cleaning small food out of strainer there is a simple trick to cleaning first off the shaped spatula looks like part of the packing material and was almost trashed lucky i have always insisted all packing materials are saved and not put into the trash because if you loose this special shaped spatula you might as well forget about cleaning this juicer trick to cleaning take the basket the special designed spatula using the shorter size of the spatula scrap scoop the left over fruit material out of the strainer basket then use the specially designed spatula s shorter side to scrap with on the outside of the basket it will fit pefectly then put it under running water and scrape the outside of the strainer basket it will scrap off the the pulp that is stuck through the micro screen basket as you turn the strainer and scrape under the running water you will see how easyly the strainer basket is cleaned then repeat the process on the inside of the strainer basket while under runing water once you see the pulp clean from the strainer basket s inne sides then the next step is to cup your hand under the strainer vertical held while the water is running since the pulp floats in water the slight remaining pulp will float in the pool od water you have created then slightly tilt the stainer and the floating pulp will float over the rim and out of your stainer leaving the strainer fairly clean repeat the prpocess as needed i am juicing times each day sometime as much as a gallon of juice at a time it cleans quickly and juicer quickly and quietly i am very happy with this product i strongly recomend this item jef 
egg poacher scrambled eggs this is exactly what i wanted i use it to cook scrambled eggs that are round and fit on biscuits my husband loves sausage egg biscuits and when you use egg rings they are flat and you have to use oil you fill this up half way no oil so no fat microwave for min sec wait min and you re ready i put a paper towel inside and turn over the eggs will stay warm for to min easy to clean grea 
simply the best here i have a refurbished palinato x textured very hardy stainless and a good bargain with no cosmetic flaws to start mo warranty but let me correct one point made in these reviews the drip grill below is made of chromed plastic a rather new trend that works quite well the steam nob as well seems to be this material all around this is quite an improvement on the x more boiler pressure plus a more heat efficient design makes the whole machine heat in less than half the time as the x cups warm quicker also it also seems to handle ground coffee a little better still it s important to use a grind as fine as can be without becoming powder and the milk should properly be low or no fat for steaming fat content just makes more fat not true foamed milk 
my favorite pan i only have one all clad pan id like to have more i love this little pan i use it all the time for cooking different things a hamburger some linguicia portuguese sausage and eggs i use some canola oil in it for something that might stick such as an egg i have no problem cleaning it at all ! as soon as i am done frying something i put some water in the pan whatever might be stuck to it comes right off even better than with a non stick surface having used cheap pans my whole life it was amazing the difference it makes using a pan that works the way it should it makes cooking fun ! love my little pan 
ecopod works great with practice i have run almost a whole bag of coffee through my ecopod now and it has become my standard method now i grind the coffee in an electric coffee grinder at the most fine setting then run the coffee through again i fill the pod about full after tamping down the coffee very lightly i get good foam and a fairly strong brew using less coffee gets more foam sometimes but the downside is a weaker cup i have also put standard drip grind into our grinder to get it smaller in size and that has worked good also grinding the coffee very fine fluffs it up and so it looks like you are loading a lot of coffee for each cup but actually its about a heaping teaspoon of drip grind coffee so it is very economical those having problems need to try again if it works for me it will work for anyone 
polder ldr step designer step stool with rail easy to use and store very stable and strong 
nice pillow for star wars fan this is a nice pillow for a star wars fan 
best book lights we ve tried first in the interest of full disclosure i am writing this review under my husband s real name because it s his account my husband and i are avid readers and we often read in bed before falling asleep as such we ve looked at and tried just about every book light on the market we initially found these lights by chance at a costco sitting by themselves the only package available on top of a stack of books we tried them out and they were fantastic most book lights had one of two features we liked and a lot more that we didn t these were just what we wanted they are lightweight they are very very bright the battery is easy to change the light bulbs have never needed to be replaced they are compact and don t weigh down a paperback the clip is strong and stays in place best of all is the swivel you can direct these lights anywhere you need them left right up down all around plus you can direct the arm that holds the lights to various angles it s perfect for night time or car air travel reading someone said it s hard to find batteries for the lights we ve never had that problem target and walmart carry an extensive supply i think they are we get duracell and energizer brands and they last a long time very easy to replace just unscrew the back of the light and pop them in i will say the first lights we got in that original two pack from costco we have never seen them at the store again it was such a fluke did have a problem with one of the two lights one of the batteries always gets stuck and is next to impossible to remove we end up unscrewing the other half of the light where the bulbs are and pushing the battery out the other side this is obviously not intended to be the way to change the battery however this has never happened with the lights we ve bought from this company through amazon only one one of the first two we got at costco and i m not even sure they were made by the same people although they look identical since buying that first two pack we ve bought four more lights from this company at amazon my husband and i keep them in various locations of the house in our travel bags in the car etc and get constant use out of them they are durable and long lasting only one thing i have a complaint about the claw clip is supposed to open using a thumb press movement but i find it difficult to use it s easily worked around just by opening it with my fingers and attaching it to the book maybe i have small hands my husband doesn t have this problem it s a minor issue though finally i love the colors pink blue and purple especially they just make you happy to look at but maybe that s just me 
best vacuum ever this is a wonderful little machine extremely lightweight and easy to maneuver but with amazing suction power ! it also has a feature to quickly and easily lessen that power with a quick flip of a small tab to easily vacuum blinds and curtains lots of great attachments i absolutely love this little vacuum cleaner plus the filter makes it easy to quickly empty and you don t have to mess with bags i love it ! i give it thumbs up 
filter for hard water still allows some dust deposits live in az and don t have water softener need to change more often than recommended 
okay for the money but nothing to write home about unlike what the photo suggests the entire set is black and not dark brown this lends a versatile and contemporary look to the tables which would work well if you have modern looking furniture however the black finish seems to work against the veneer pattern the black ends up being shiny so not only does the veneer pattern stand out but so do the natural patterns in the wood and any scratches or dings the end result is a rough almost old looking table seems like the wood could also have been sanded down more since there s still somewhat of a raw feel on the plus side both the coffee table and accompanying end tables are remarkably sturdy they are not easy to get knocked over and they seem able to hold heavy items i ve got my computer printer and feet resting on the coffee table right now and it s not budging the coffee table is small and more suited to go in front of a loveseat a perk if you re living in an apartment with limited space an advantage to the black color is that the end tables can go anywhere overall i can t complain because is a good deal for cheap apartment furniture it s functional affordable and reasonably attractive but there s no mistaking this for anything but low end furniture 
just what i expected the price was right ! the stand looks expensive and does the job ! 
so far so good peace at last we have only had this for days but we are very happy i ordered this because of rude neighbors who leave there dogs who bark and bark and they don t stop out is a dog run outside our bedroom window other neigbors have complained as well they still won t do anything after setting up the bark stop it didn t take long before they got the idea they get or barks out then nothing i called the other complaining neighbor and asked if she heard the dogs trying to bark i told her that we bought super bark stop and hid it she thought that was great now maybe we can enjoy a nice fall day with the windows open or working in the yard update okay the real test came last night and again this morning what was the test sirens i just had to laugh they couldn t bark and howl all i heard was this muffled grumbling coming from them i am so glad we bought this 
looks the same as the kitchen kettle i bought for x mas not sure if the kettle on this is bigger than presto s other gem the kitchen kettle but if it s the same as that then this is a great addition to have for the kitchen great for soups stews steaming deep fry cooking lots of other cooking applications easy to clean easy to use thermostat on the cord haven t gone wrong with the kitchen kettle so i feel this version should be of the same high quality as well 
simple cheap and fun both of my cats really love this and my wallet adores it because it s cheap as well as being on the fairly durable side as well my cats are active they love to play run after and catch things and like to play two or three times a day as several other reviewers have noted you should keep a light grip pinch on one end and that s enough to make the other end swing and weave around in the air then just roll your end between your fingertips a bit and it ll bounce a bit and swing around and hopefully entice your kitties play with the other end i ve also held it in the middle and let both cats go at their seperate end but it s stiffer that way and doesn t move as much boo is about four and half years old and the other poxie is three poxie will play with anything that moves or is shiney and will chew carboard for the heck of it so she loves it boo is a bit pickier likes to stalk things and be convinced that he really does want to play i usually to drag this around and wiggle it on the floor a bit to catch his interest but he always comes around and will start batting at it in the air as well both will go wild if it wiggles and makes noise just barely visiable from the edge of a cardboard box or paper bag though it holds up very well they will pounce and chew on the cardboard and wire the ends of the cardboard do fray a bit and get soggy but they re tightly coiled with the wire and it lasts a good amount of time the price is great also so no qualms about getting a new one very couple of months 
great for kids toys i put all of my kids stuffed animals in these my kids can open them all alone and i can lift them up and toss them out of the way when more room is needed i m thinking of getting more for the extra comforters and sleeping bag 
great pet gate received the gates on time easy to put together decorative only high lovely accent exactly what i needed 
corning ware creations ramekin like the color bakes well good size freezes well 
lightweight yet durable i looooove these dishes so far my mother had a set of corelle livingware while i was growing up and we had those things forever they never break ! i love that they are so light but don t chip very easily they don t overheat as much in the microwave like some other dishes either the pattern is very simple but cheery i m actually thinking about buying another set i like them so much 
love it i bought this mixer for my dad i have a kitchenaid but the reviews liked this model better for bread making my dad s passion i agree he is really happy with it and i used it last weekend and i love it it is great and bonus cheaper than the kitchenaid it would be nice if it had the capability for some grinder pasta etc attachments but really i buy my sausage and pasta so 
great pan one of the best frying pan i ve ever owned it cooks evenly cleans easily and looks classy 
rave reviews very nice set sleek design feels good on the hand ultra sharp blade and gleeming metal we will order more of these and give some as gifts 
pretty happy i have two little boys and somehow my spoons seem to disappear i am sure some dig of my home in a million years will have people wondering if we worshiped utensils anyway i am pretty happy with this set i didn t fall in love with it but for the price i think is is wonderful it has a sturdy feel to it and washes in the dishwasher well there isn t much difference in the size of the dinner and salad fork and the same with the spoons but i do think it was a great buy for the price and would recommend to others 
garlic obsessed i put this in the microwave for minute and out comes the most delicious cooked garlic ! you don t have to add anything to it ! cooked garlic just by itself is very sweet even my year old enjoys it 
mortar and pestle very sturdy little bowl and pestle just the right size for herbs and nuts 
excellent i have this quart saucier pan as well as two of the mario batali quart cast iron with enamel pots with lids these are oven safe i believe up to degrees they are excellent cookware i rarely use any other pots anymore heat retention is fantastic and they cook extremely evenly remember to use wooden preferably or plastic spoons with these pots as metal tools will scratch up the coating handwash and dry no dishwashers with these ! they are expensive but when you figure that you will have these for life and possibly your great grandchildrens lives as well they are well worth the investment i really haven t found a type of cookware that compares to this if you are serious about cooking do yourself a favor and get one of these ! 
wok assistant if you own a carbon steel wok you may as well add this spatula to your cooking tools it works much better than a long handled metal spoon and is certainly safer than using a standard stainless spatula instead of stirring the food around the pan the spatula helps to toss the food around and get it up on the sides of the wok it also allows you to scoop out more food than a spoon or regular spatula i considered purchasing another wok spatula but the handle had an angle that made it appear to be better suited for scooping and flipping burgers on the grill rather than stir frying speaking of handles the one on this spatula may work itself loose after a few uses if this happens you will need to bang it against a hard surface to reposition it i originally gave this stars because i hadn t experienced the handle coming off i still think it works pretty good but would rather give it stars 
good deal this purchase came with stackable racks i thought it was only one rack it stores very easily in a compact space and works well i don t know if it rusts since i have only wiped the tray with a cloth after using it 
the ultimate pillow this is the only pillow i have ever found regardless of price that gives me complete sleeping comfort this pillow and i go back many many years and i could not find it again in retail stores today i received only two what was i thinking from amazon and immediately ordered two more for our cabin this is a no brainer buy sweet dreams 
great pillow if you ve ever been to any normal store that has pillows you ll know that finding a body pillow that wont die in seconds is hard i ve had this for a few weeks now and it shows no signs of loosing its fluff of which it is very fluffy but not so much that it will smother you if it lasts longer than my other failed attemps i may have to stock up 
timing quality met expectations i received the item within the expected time period and in good condition 
a couple of drawbacks i recieved my bbq pit right before christmas and overall i love it i can put chicken ribs pork loin whatever in around lunch time and it s delicious by supper but it is large so it takes up quite a bit of room that also makes it harder to clean the thing i really don t like is the lid it just slides into grooves so it frequently moves when i am opening the lid when it s hot and heavy it s a pain but it is convenient and my food tastes great 
last blender you ll ever need bulky noisy and takes up lots of space but it is the greatest drink mixer you ll ever buy my wife is the queen of frosty drinks with this blender the ingredients don t separate half way through your drinking pleasure our old mixer also touted as a professional blender caused the ingedients to separate in the glass after about minutes have not seen that happening after this blender get s through doing its job crushes ice without cringing and is esstially oblivious to anything thrown in just blends everyting into a great pulp highly recommended for the serious frosty drinker 
loaf pans if you are serious about baking bread then this is the loaf pan for you they are slighly larger than the normal glass loaf pan although you may find a less expensive glass loaf pan this perform very well and will hold those recipes that tend to go over the top of a small loaf pan they are more expensive that other glass pans but nothing beats a hot loaf of bread coming out of the oven done to perfection and these loaf pans are great 
a pan i use all the time although called a stir fry pan by the manufacturer this is actually a good general use pan for tasks like making risotto and cooking various sauces in addition to stir frying the bottom may be a little flat for stir frying purists but this what makes the pan good for other tasks i already had a pan like this one that was about four years old and going strong when the glass top slipped and shattered on our tiled kitchen floor the top is an important part of the pan for some uses so i had to order a new one i use this pan nearly every evening for cooking something it heats evenly retains heat well and is very good value for the cost the only reason it got four stars instead of five is its size it is a bit large for an ordinary stove like ours but its versatility makes up for this one problem 
small problem with the large size this set has all the quality and good looks that i expected there is only one problem it is big ! the quot plates are so tall in my dishwasher that they only fit in the center of my kitchenaid dishwasher so i can t wash more than at once and the bowls don t slide in between the prongs but kind of have to lean over so that they take up extra space i got the rio set partly because of the oz mugs my husband is a serious coffee drinker i love the design but the plates and bowls are really way bigger than any person with a normal size appetite needs 
fabulous for the price these sheets are the best deal i ve seen on deep pocket sheets it s so hard to find sheets to fit our bed they are a great deal 
vacuuming impaired i hate to vacuum and when my kenmore vacuum cleaner died i had no idea what to do i read all of the customer reviews and the bissell seemed impressive it was damaged in shipping and withing a few weeks bissell sent a new one to me i am very impressed my first time using the bissell was a shocker the bagless container had to be emptied twice my old vacuum cleaner didn t pick up much apparently now my floors are very clean my allergies aren t as bad and my carpet looks great i would recommend this product to anyone looking in need of a really good affordable vacuum cleaner 
excellent item was as described and arrived flawless krups directions are a little hard fague to understand 
rejuvinated our cat this product worked great for our year old cat due to his increasing arthritis we were concerned that we were going to have to put him to sleep soon to put him out of his misery after being on this months he is back to normal he still moves slow but he s not in pain and you would move slow too if you were years old ! we highly recommend this 
super towels great towels they are soft absorbent and thick super value for the money i would buy them over and over again 
good report on dualit toaster for more years then i want to count i have been fussing with one or more big box store toasters and found they all came up realy short on many fronts i decided to purchase the dualit as an alternative to the morning frustrations i am thrilled with it s operation and do agree that any number on the dial above is only there to make a person feel powerful as they are not needed thanks again for building a fine product 
cow tea kettle the whistle of this tea kettle brings the herd to the kitchen in a hurry the delightful design brightens up the kitchen great capacity and pours without spilling the delivery service was very fast 
super sofa we ordered this sofa and matching ottoman on target com with a discount we recieved via email it has far exceeded our expectations i read all the reviews and they are dead on the upholstery is darker the cushions are firm and comfortable it s very nice the frame is solid and the fabric luxurious the only problem we had is with the freight conractor that target used being slow to communicate but it did arrive in one piece and was easy to put together having people helped if you are thinking about this couch go ahead ! you won t be sorry its high quality and affordable ! this is very durable and looks like it costs twice as much i would buy it all over again ! we love it 
longterm user of hb indoor grills speaks just bought my third model i want to speak up on behalf of hamilton beach indoor grills i just ordered this model which is my third in about a half dozen years it probably will last a few years making that three in ten years that s not bad at all what went wrong with the one before this the previous model with removable grids is that the turn off mechanism stopped being dependable i noticed that my steak got overcooked but thought it had been my fault for leaving it on too long it wasn t until the next morning that i saw that the grill never shut itself off eeek stayed on overnight so it s time for replacement after four years or so of constant use and perhaps some casual abuse the model before that replaced with the for cleaning ease and because i wanted white was given to my mother who also got a few years of faithful second hand service so that one too lasted about four years i also gave one away as a present and its recipient who had been suspicious of such contraptions and has a tiny kitchen loved it and used it for years therefore this is the fourth hb indoor grill that i ve purchased if you are single and don t have a lot of counter space this is tough to beat particularly for less than and no tax or shipping charges and an easy return policy in addition to the one year warranty before i bought the i checked out the george foreman grills including the next generation cuisinart t fal etc some of the others have some nice features that this model lacks such as temperature control greater grilling area floating hinge but to me that was offset by how much bulkier they are oftentimes quite ugly imho and not that much more bang for the buck i really don t like it that some of the smaller gf models turn on only by being plugged in the wall maybe this is intended as a safety feature but i wouldn t want to constantly have to mess with that a power button should be essential rather than considered a nicety for which they charge extra this does a nice job with grilled sandwiches meat and fish sliced vegetables etc you get grill marks and it cooks everything right after you learn the appropriate times for different types of food it s cooked bacon fine imho it does quite nicely with frozen meat or veggie patties and chicken breasts i particularly like to throw on a fairly thick frozen sirloin or salmon or tuna steak the outside gets browned while the interior stays moist and lightly cooked if you catch it in time the reservoir cup holds a lot so if you marinate the meat or fish and it drips it s not a problem if it s not essential to dispose of the fat that drips off and collects in the reservoir the ostensible purpose of indoor grills and still their prime marketing claim you can find ways to use it to baste the food during cooking buy a second cup or find something else to use or use it as the basis of gravy some reviewers have noted that the nonstick surface on the gf models flakes or chips off over time these hbs hold up but you do need to follow instructions wipe the grids clean while still warm and wash in the sink or dishwasher don t use cleaning products or tools that will strip off the nonstick covering and use spray oil before grilling also let the grill heat up min before use as per the directions food placed on hot surfaces sticks less than food that heats up with the surface of course such caramelization also enhances taste to some extent so you may want to fiddle with this for your purposes carefully scraping off the caramelized parts to avoid scratching the surface if the grids get messed up they can be replaced as long as the parts are manufactured which probably will be for a while the models i ve purchased have made a tidy footprint on my countertop and i know how to make it do what i need it to do it wasn t worth it to spend maybe even twice as much for a few more bells and whistles when i would be settling for a style that i dislike and losing half the counter space yes it can be put away after use but i like to have kitchen gizmos within easy reach particularly if i like the way they look the grill gets too much use to be constantly tucked away anyway and this model matches my other stuff if i had chrome appliances or did more entertaining or a larger counter area i would ve been seriously tempted by the cusinart model though i have to admit therefore i think some of the negative comments need to be taken in the context of maybe judging too quickly or nitpicking needing a larger size grill for a family preferring more features using it incorrectly etc neither i nor the people i know who have had hb indoor grills have had problems with melting plastic or plastic odors hb makes the honda of indoor grills it s dependable rather than flashy not big which matters for those with small kitchens rates well with consumers and through independent tests lasts for years and isn t more than a one or two person household needs why pay and pay for the electricity over time for what you don t need if your needs are modest a modest indoor grill may well suit your purposes i look forward to the new grill living up to the quality of its predecessors in my household 
fiesta fruit bowl item was satisfactory but thought it was bigger probably my mistak 
gr rrrreat opener this wine opener is absolutely amazing ! i bought it after i saw it on one of the morning shows never expecting it to be as good as they said however i was totally surprised i ve tried many different openers and always wound up with cork in the wine or the whole cork pushing down into the bottle it works very well on both regular corks and synthetic corks i have successfully removed the cork every time i used it which is fairly often i plan on buying a couple for christmas presents for people who are hard to buy for don t think twice buy it 
great value i ve just purchased these glasses from amazon they arrived in about days with free shipping in perfect condition double boxed with plenty of bubble wrap and packing material i find these glasses to be an exceptional value i won t quibble with reviewers who believe their riedel glasses deliver wine with better taste i m a wine enthusiast but admittedly not an expert my palate cannot discern a difference drinking the same wine out of these glasses versus a riedel product and at less than half the price with great functional design and looks i ll be purchasing spiegelau products again 
proud to be a global owner this item utility knife actually was for a friend a fellow foodie once youve used any global knife you feel as though all other knives in comparison fail at their job i m the owner of globals thus far i will purchase more in the next year but this paring knife is a great starter to begin with even if its the only global you get you ll see how versitile it is will go on to recommend to friends and family 
cat adores this bed i bought the bed for my new puppy but the moment i put it down the cat ran into it and wouldn t come out he absolutely loves it and spends every day in it i come home and see his wide eyes peeking out from under the hood yes when he lies way in the back it tips backward which might be a problem for some dogs but the fluffiness can be flattened by hand to help this to not happen the cat seems to enjoy it when it tips so the cat has taken it over and now i ll have to find something else for the dog 
great for a wet bar this is a great small refrigerator the platinum and black finish add a touch of class i am currently using this refrigerator as an accessory to a wet bar that i just installed it fits perfect and keeps the beverages and other items very cold it is also very quiet which is a plus the only downfall is the spacing of the racks it was very difficult to stack anything vertically however the door rack and can rack made up for it for the price this is a great classy little refrigerator 
braun electric water kettle great product we use it all the time and it works perfectly 
danby countertop dishwasher well the only problem i had with mine is lifting it by myself up to the counter i have had my dishwasher for eight monthes now and have used it almost every day i have not had a single problem with it at all it works just as well as high priced built in models just plug it in to any outlet instal the faucet adapter and attach the quick release water hose and turn on your hot or cold it will heat the water by it s self water and add the soap turn it on and it s done all the dishes in it s longest cycle it has four in about minutes i m a guy and love the thing before you couldn t get me to do the dishes at the sink for a gazillion bucks ! ask my wife this thing is very well made if you re hunting for a portable counter unit get this one it s well worth the money 
gorgeous print the best rooster print i ve seen yet while they could be made out of a more durable material stoneware would be nice they are absolutely gorgeous after i received my first set i ordered a second set just to have in case they break 
convient storage the product shipped great only problem was that one lid did not come with a seal on it so it had to be returned the colors are great and the storage is good 
satisfied user the hoover s wind tunnel performed as expected the longer hose and lock unlock lever makes use easier the cover over the attachments keeps them out of site and clean i did not like the suction on the small beater bar attachment for carpeted stairs better off just using the large one 
not bad great size towel however i wish they could have been a little thicke 
the little magic wand rarely would i give an ordinary vacuum attachment a five star rating but this is far from ordinary i was impressed first off with the packaging usually when i buy something that s encased in plastic it takes superman to cut the thing out not so with the thoughtful folks at dyson they provided a package that you can easily open and then close again second i was impressed by the construction of the brush itself the bristles are very fine yet sturdy and practically mold themselves around anything you vacuum with it and the material used to make the rest of the brush is the same tough crash helmet plastic as the dyson itself nice something to keep in mind is that the brush comes with two small adapters one has a small triangle on it and the other has a small o in the package there is a small booklet with pictures showing what the adapters are for the one with the triangle attaches to the brush when you want to put it on the long wand the adapter with the o attaches to the brush when you want to use it with just the hose i mention this because i ended up vacuuming all my blinds and even my curtains before i realized i needed one of these adapters nevertheless even without the adapter the brush picked up a lot of dust which says a lot for the suction power of the dyson i have never been this amazed by something as simple as a vacuum attachment before this brush is like a little magic wand never before have i been able to vacuum my tvs computers blinds curtains and just about anything with this much ease the brush not only increased my respect and admiration for the dyson itself but also for the ingenious minds behind the development of it i highly recommend this product to anyone who owns a dyson vacuum 
just what i expected i live in a solar electric home so i don t use an electric coffeemaker this is a good alternative that brews good cuppa at a time without requiring a stack of filters the only negative is that by the time i wait the suggested minute steep my coffee has cooled considerably next time i would go with an insulated caraffe 
quick delivery the delivery was quick and the item came good packaged i didn t try it yet it came with the usefull recipe 
great waffle iron great price i really like this waffle iron it s easy to use and makes waffles fast i bought two one for a gift and one to keep got free shipping too i recommend it 
great sheets i am very happy with the quality of these sheets they are soft and warm and fit the bed perfectly 
great knives i love these knives nice balance and well made very solid and they sharpen up nicely with little effort it might be my fault for washing them in the dishwasher but after a year i noticed little rust spots that began to appear it will break my heart when and if they become too rusty to use 
excellent choice with two cats and two dogs in the house plus a messy husband and a teenager i have to have a really good vacuum and this is it i especially like the fact that the hose goes straight into the bag and all those little clumps of cat hair and bits of clay kitty litter etc can be sucked up without getting caught up in the beater bar brushes i also prefer the bagged type of vacuum because you simply fold the bag and toss it theres no storm cloud of dust as there can be with the bagless models 
a very nice set to work with i got the set yesterday and decided to put it to work today it s very easy to use you can use lower heat than with other cookware easy to use my wooden tools with and the cleanup is easy emeril bammed a home run in designing this set ! 
honeywell n silentcomfort airfilter thumbs up very quiet for sure it s helping a lot with my allergies i run it on low and that does the trick the only disadvantage is the suggested placement from any wall however i ve got it maybe feet from any wall and it s able to suck air from all directions 
the cutest and best pillow this is a great gift because there fun cuteand usefull so when you come home from a bad day at school or work there alaways there to me there like a special friend that you can cuddle so for kids and adults this is a must have 
a great knife you can t go wrong with this knife i use it almost as much as i use my inch chef s knife it holds an edge well feels light in your hand and has perfect ballance 
great product but poor shipping my only complaint is that amazon does not properly pack their products it took attempts to get them here with out any damage ! the canisters are pretty and are able to hold a large amount of product 
love this machine i upgraded to the delonghi from a year old mr coffee espresso machine and the difference is amazing the machine is easy to use and makes a great cup of espresso with a great crema i have used both the pods and my own espresso and both come out great the frother works very well also the only negatives are that the cup warmer on the top doesn t seem to work but i don t think i would use it anyway it is larger than i had hoped and i have limited counter space and the reservoir doesn t hold a great deal of water overall i would highly recommend this machine 
it s a towel i am pleased it is not a cheap discount towel nor is it a super plush towel it looks good and it washes well 
a most convenient appliance this appliance is a little marvel elegant design barely audible much more discrete than a ceiling fan and very efficient to recuperate the hot air trapped under our feet roof 
easy weighing this is an excellent set of scales the display is very good easy to read both in lbs and kg the tray is a good size and can hold reasonable quantities it fits snuggly onto the support the stainless steel finish is easy to keep clean the scales look very professional on the counter 
mine s in piece and works great i m with amalfi girl i have this pan and it works great most importantly the lid is heavy enough to weigh down the sandwiches the trick to these panini pans is that you must heat them thoroughly with the lid on before placing the sandwich inside that way the top gets toasted at the same time as for those other two i can t even imagine a cast iron pan breaking in shipment ! the ones that did must have been from a defective lot wow ! they have my sympathies 
well worth the money i d been thinking about buying a blender for making smoothies milkshakes etc for ages but instead made do with the ordinary blenders made exclusively for the home in short those blenders have been utterly disappointing because they don t crush ice feel too plasticky and never produce good drinks so after reading the glowing reviews for waring blenders i decided to take the plunge and buy one i bought the commercial bar blender with the stainless steel canister i guess i was worried that the traditional glass one might crack even if others insist that it won t it seems expensive but once you buy this you ll be wondering why you ever settled for anything less ! it crushes ice like a dream and i can turn out superb drinks no lumps it s extremely easy to use and so easy to clean i make breakfast smoothies every day now 
an old friend for many years i had a presto pressure cooker but when the sealing ring didn t work a few years back i tossed it out thinking i could never get a replacement ring i missed having that pot i m glad to have one once again stew and pot roast are the best reasons to have one but tonight will be spare ribs the new pot is nothing like my year old one it works the same in the end though i would have opted for the aluminum as that was what i had but my husband bought the stainless steel i don t think it makes a difference for the price except in appearance 
sturdy basics if you re like me and suddenly need glassware this is a great choice lets say i got a little sauced at a bar with friends was feeling a bit grand and decided to invite twelve growling tattooed punk hooligans who d never touched a decent stem over to my house for a somewhat formal dinner obviously a problematic situation would i want something that wouldn t send me into a fit once someone decided to hurl one on the floor as an proclamation absolutely would i want to make sure that my smelly ill mannered punker friends had a good glass of wine in their calloused paws and are treated as royalty at least once in their lives without a doubt this is a good hearty line of glasses for those with both price and quality in mind rock on 
rachel ray furi knife i have used this knife for everything since it arrived it is perfect for everyday use great product for the price 
cerama bryte cleaner this stuff really works well makes it look brand new the key to getting the tough baked on foods off the range are the scraper and cleaning pads 
great case i love this case ! it s light weight yet sturdy my machine fits in easily with lots of room for extras like patterns sewing tools etc 
great vacuum for the price we ve had the eureka rg boss for a month or so and are very happy with how well it works on both carpet and tile it picks up far better than our old vacuum and at it was a great value though it is refurbished it looks and runs like brand new the only minor annoyance is that it s a little loud if you re looking for a new upright vacuum this is one you should consider 
you get what you pay for after spending a week reading reviews and looking at toasters i decided on the kithcenaid kmttss the reasons for my decision top brand name we own a kithchen aid table mixer and dishwasher very good reviews quality you can see and feel fit finish and materials are top notch extreamly even toasting results relatively quick toasting very wide slots bagel and warming functions body of toaster remains cool to touch im am very happy with our choice if you re looking for quality you won t go wrong you can buy a cheaper toaster but in my opinion not not a better one 
special gift bought these for our son inlaw for chrismas and he loved them i wished i had ordered two sets maybe next time 
strong and attractive this blender is outstanding powerful and pretty should have been however dishwasher safe 
nice value for glass decanter suitable for bottle of wine i m very satisfied with this purchase and am writing this to clarify a couple points i was uncertain of based on other reviews this decanter is glass the box claims it is mouth blown glass it is made in china the photo in the description depicts it holding one full bottle of wine ml it does not drip when it pours just one drop rolls off the lip much as what happens when you pour from a wine bottle it is nice looking though it wouldn t be mistaken for a crystal decante 
well made bought after reading cooks illustrated recommendation i haven t used it yet but appears to be very well built has a long handle and a porus thick wire mesh strainer welded to the frame 
incredible piece of kitchen luxury i have oogled le creuset dutch ovens since i first became a fan of ina garten and i was spoiled enough to receive one as an easter gift the quart in black i love the look of this pot and the heft it is a solid quality piece i roasted chicken in it tonight and it came out beautifully technically this pot isn t nonstick but i could have wiped the pot clean with a paper towel ! it was so easy to clean i couldn t justify buying myself one pot worth two hundred dollars but i see now that i will use this until i m old and grey i can t wait to make soup in it tomorrow such a fabulous investment ! if i had known about them when i got married i would have registered for one and a kitchenaid artisan mixmaster too but that s another story don t make the same mistake i did 
good product i like the depth of this container i use it more for storage than as a marinator because of its depth this is excellent for keeping berries fresh i have no use for the grater i prefer the food processor and standing graters the canister is a clear plastic which looks much better than the smoke colored ones as a marinator it produced very flavorful chicken but i m not sure if it was more flavorful than traditionally marinated i am giving this four stars instead of five because the canister is top rack dishwasher safe but the lids are not 
great this skillet is the best its shape and size are great its quality is remarkable and the non stick coating is revolutionary i have never seen non stick coating like this before i highly recommend this skillet 
getting the most from your favorite bourbon i did some research on these glasses before deciding to purchase them the riedel company has an outstanding reputation for creating elegant glassware which brings out the best in specific spirits the shapes and designs vary according the type of wine or alcohol they definitely have a winner with their bourbon glasses after receiving the glasses i invited some friends to do a little taste test having them sample bourbon from a variety of glasses without exception the clear winner was the riedel bourbon glass the taste enhancement was exceptional these glasses would make a great gift and conversation piece for anyone with a pallet for kentucky s finest ! wr 
going back for more as the spokesperson from the kitchen of a family of five which includes boys and their friends that use flatware to fix paintball guns play extreme outdoor games and use spoons to open locked doors etc i have to say this has been great tableware for us no dings dents or rust i ve had this set for over four years and it still looks great it s time to fill in lost pieces that are somewhere out in the yard

dude you gotta get these sheets i ve never bought sheets in my life till now what i had in my closet were the assorted christmas gifts etc thru the years had to learn about things like thread count etc what i had was an approximate thread count felt like freddie kruger was clawing my back whenever i turned over t c like butter ! yes they are heavy but very soft the difference is night and day they fit my bed well and my friends couldn t believe the price they immediately ordered same on line shipping was very quick what a great gift idea for the man who knows nothing about sheets ! order yours today 
great product and with free shipping i like the other lady ordered the textured leaves products i ordered two each of the rectangle baking dish and two sets of ramekins and one each of the pc bowl set and the covered bowls cookware all were shipped in perfect condition and the shipping was free via amazon i plan to order more pieces the product itself is quite heavy and study i was amazed by the weight of the pieces i look forward to using the new additions to my textured leaves dishes and cookware thanks 
wonderful product i have cats and have owned the other brand named pet fountain with the filtration system i gave up on it after the constant cleanings and the cat hair in the water and filter the motor burned out i think because the water level was low the bubbler took my cats getting used to it makes more noise than the prior fountain but after days they have adapted and enjoy it one cat sleeps right next to it i think he enjoys the sound of it like a brook running water i highly recommend this product it was easy to set up the water tank needs filling about once per week and it s easy to clean 
do ityourself love it ! bought it for my year old who is in the i want to do it myself stage put her two favorite cereals in the dispenser and now she can get a bowl fill it with cereal and grab a spoon all by herself in the morning she still has to wait until mommy pours the milk but we re working on that ! 
i think this is great i read all the reports last year about having a refrigerator thermometer especially after katrina and figured it was about time i got one well i have been happy with this one ! i purchased it elsewhere but i love it ! suction cups are tricky things and i noticed if i open and close the door a lot it gets a little loose but it is no problem to moisten it and restick i have kept this on the door so i can read it easily i just love a digital readout and am happy someone finally did one for the fridge ! i put it in the freezer for fun too and it worked great there too 
very nice gift i ordered this wine tote as a gift and was pleased how fast it was shipped i live in alaska and had ordered the bag last thursday it was here on monday the bag it s self is awesome this is the perfect gift 
this is incredible we first used the new vacuum immediately after using our old hoover i was amazed at the amount of dog hair and dirt that the dyson picked up that the hoover missed already it seems like the air is cleaner and fresher in the house my only fear is that the dyson is so much more powerful that one day it will suck the carpets completely up off the floor 
great deal microwave for reasonable price i bought this microwave after returning a brand new more expensive microwave that didn t work the minute i was trying to use it satisfied with this one basic but does all a microwave is supposed to do great price too 
nice heater love the remote i really like this heater has lots of functions and the remote is awesome i use it under my desk at work it s great because i can place it further back and don t have to get on my hands and knees to turn it on and off i also really like the oscillating feature 
i love it we received one of these for christmas and we can t stop using it this skillet heats up fast is a great size for anything and absolutely nothing sticks to it ! it is perfect for making breakfasts which is why we are registering for another one for our upcoming wedding that way everything we re making is all ready at the same time it also doubles as a buffet server which is always handy for entertaining i highly recommend one of these 
great quality and value i bought the first set because they seemed well priced compared to the terrycloth style we usually use they are of high quality good color and do hold their shape i have to remember not to use a dryer sheet so they have increased absorbtion rate very pleased 
aquarium review this was for my husband it is our third aquarium we have one outside and inside he decided it was time to upgrade some of his older aquariums he loves the rounded edges and it is really pretty with the fish rocks and plants inside a happy custome 
surprised at some of the comments re cosmetics honestly you would think many of the reviewers here were submitting their knives for a beauty pageant and not using them to cook with if you read some of the opinions voiced here however i feel another poster was on the mark when they mentioned that many probably buy their high price german knives as more of a status symbol showoff item than as a true tool or utility item i wouldn t be surprised if many of those commenting on scratches on the handle order out five to six times a week and the knives at most get used to slice a lemon for their gin and tonic with that aside onto the product at hand my wife and i were given a set of both professional s i believe six piece set and large set of henckels ever edge for our wedding we owned a smaller set of ever edge but put a larger set on our registry because we wanted something nicer and more versatile we took both the six piece pro s and the nine piece ever edge back and exchanged it for the nice piece professional s set i happened to be working at a store which sold high end cutlery wusthof global henckels etc and happened to get a good discount on it i also picked up six matching professional s steak knives to accompany the set as i said above i worked in a store for a short amount of time which also sold other high quality brands such as wusthof and global however i chose the henckels as at the time the price was the best of the bunch the knives felt much better in my hands than either the global or the wusthof and i greatly preferred the straighter edge of the henckels over the belly of the wusthof really it comes down to personal preference though as what feels good to me might feel awful to you also wusthof and others are only sold either on net discounters or higher end cooking stores which is great if you like to hunt around however henckles and their professional s line are sold in a good deal of retailers which to me means that ordering replacements or buying additional pieces will be that much easier and i will have a good deal more room to work in terms of price negotiation so if you are a knife snob and need to buy your knives at the high end knife cooking shop only and or will get annoyed seeing your knives for sale in bed bath and beyond then you might not want to consider the pro s line someone below mentioned forged vs sct and from what i have learned read on the subject the differences are so minor that the end user will never notice the difference basically it boils down to the blade either being forged from one piece of metal older method or on larger blades forming them from a composite or forging two pieces or more of metal together to make one blade consumer reports and cooking com refer to the professional s style as forged because it is very close in form and function to traditionally forged pieces the only difference is that it isn t physically forged from one piece of metal the other option is stamped such as cheaper knives and cutco overall i am more than pleased with these knives and wouldn t hesitate to buy them again my wife loves them and they perform very well while the finish might not have been pristine out of the box yes i noticed some scratches as well on the handles one has to remember they are only knives and they are meant to be abused when selling other brands i noticed the quality was no better or worse wusthof and global had their share of flaws in finishing as well so your mileage may vary as others said check these out in the store before you buy and compare to others if you like a nice straight blade with a sure feel and a slightly smaller handle good for smaller hands then the henckels might be for you 
sango nova brown piece hostess set the product is exactly what i ordered however the first shipment was not properly packed and arrived broken replacement was prompt with no hassle 
new customer bought this product with a gift certificate from my children i am very satisfied with the bowls i give this product a high recommendation 
visi therm deluxe aquarium heaters watt keeps the tank warm for my little fish friend 
excellent product works well you can adjust the mill to grind pepper to your desired level of granularit 
perfect size ! the one pan that does it all i just received my le creuset casserole a few weeks ago and love it ! i was a little on the fence about the size before i bought it but i ve found that it s the perfect size i ve used it as intended making a casserole but i ve also been able to use it in place of my skillet the pan is nice and wide and i ve been able to brown chicken breasts in it the lid is nice and heavy with a tight fit i cooked and simmered a meat dish in it tonight and it made everything very tender and moist this is a very adaptable piece of cookware i think i will end up cooking most of my meals in this pan as most le creuset pieces clean up has been a breeze i just let it cool soak in in a little water and it wipes clean very easy as i said before i am very happy i went with the qt size instead of the larger qt i usually cook about servings at a time and have found that this works great for us i would only suggest the qt size if you are cooking for on a regular basis 
good heater awkward design i bought this heater for a spare bedroom the quiet and ability to set the thermostat to an exact temperature was a big selling point for me this unit does a good job of taking the chill out of the air however don t expect it to quickly blow out volumes of hot air and heat an entire room within two minutes i like the fact that it is completely quiet and doesn t off gas any strange smells like the delonghi mica panel radiator however since it is a baseboard design you have to get down on the floor with a flashlight to see and adjust the display which has no light a remote control would be a good improvement although this unit is very lightweight and has a low long profile it is still fairly large and doesn t exactly disappear if you get my drift overall i am pleased with the job it does 
fits the bill i bought this board to cut large pieces of meat chickens flank steaks pork roasts it s more than big enough for all these the reservoirs on the side do a perfect job of collecting all the juices that run off the board arrived incredibly thirsty i gave it a healthy dose of mineral oil which i treat all my wooden kitchen tools with and this solved the problem the board is made of cherry and is a bargain at the price amazon sells it for 
nice no complains i like the nice pink trio pattern and the price isn t bad at all looks cool so far bought it months ago and it s not stained or damaged yet 
great bag holder this product just greatly reduced the space that bags were taking up under my counter great organizing product 
fun for both of us my dog was scared of it and barked the first two or three times i turned it on but she s grown to love it and even whine for it she smacks it from one side of the room to the other and falls all over herself trying to pick it up while it s on i can t help but laugh at her with it i was so happy to find a toy she could play with more than once or twice without destroying she just turned one year old and the extra large rope bones last weeks before they re chewed into two pieces with strings all over my house 
very good cookware but exterior is not dishwasher safe the bodies are made of thick aluminum with a full stainless steel lining on the inside the thick aluminum bodies make them heat evenly and the stainless interior make them non reactive with food my only gripes are that the rim of the pots have exposed non anodized aluminum which become discolored with use and the anodized aluminum exteriors become discolored if washed in a dishwasher these are just cosmetic issues that don t affect the function but i had higher expectations given the relatively high price of this set i also considered the all clad cookware that has stainless steel cladding on both the interior and exterior in retrospect perhaps those would have been a better choice assuming the thermal properties don t suffer too much from the exterior stainless steel coating 
perfect to keep the fruit flies off this item works exactly as described and looks quite pretty to boot ! i use it to keep those little fruit flies you occasionally get in the kitchen off my baked goods etc and also outside when we eat on the patio 
steam engine first of all this thing is huge ! make shure you have the space all of the features work as advertised the browning feature works much better than we thought it would just like a skillet quiet compared to a stovetop unit and much safer build quality is excellent easy to clean just what we wanted 
make the pot removeable the only reason this doesn t get stars is the fact that you can not take out the pot you also cannot immerse this in water so cleaning is a giant pain that said it s great for dips that need to be kept warm such as my famous chile con queso just put everything together and plug it in a few hours before a party cut a block of velveeta into cubes put in the lil dipper add a few tablespoons of medium pace picante add of a small can of chopped green chiles for more spice dribble in the juice from a jar of jalapenos to thin it out you can add cream half and half or milk or even water but that will dull the taste serve with your favorite torilla chips you can also make this in the microwave if you need to make something in a hurry i wouldn t recommend putting this on a dining table as you d need an extension cord and kids could trip over it and burn themselves heck i guess at some parties adults could too but a buffet or counter against the wall would be fine 
can t beat the price i first purchased a model ice shaver and wasn t happy with the output it was too grainy so i returned it this one puts out as good if not better quality of shaved ice for a much cheaper price we used this every day for two months my daughter can t have food dye and i was able to find syrup that was all natural and organic and it actually tastes good 
i don t want to get out of bed i love this duvet cover i didn t think my down comforter could be any more comfortable and i bought the cover simply to keep it clean i didn t realize that it could make my bed so much more comfortable ! it is very soft and a great addition 
beautiful i love these glasses and the price is great ! too bad mikasa has discontinued the original cheers line 
regarding delonghi i have had a delonghi for several years now different model to be sure i have had to replace the grommet and the stupid plastic crema maker i poked around in my phone book a bit got the parts without problem the plastic part broke again but i find i really don t care it has no impact on the coffee 
gift well received my daughter is thrilled with the quality and heft of the knives 
still learning having never worked at a starbucks or otherwise i only knew that i liked boutique coffees more than folgers et al trusting the products lines of the local gourmet kitchen store i tried many of their machines on display noting ease of use as well as the final product in many cases it came down to the obvious personal taste and the particular roast being used trying to spend my day specialty coffee money on a machine that would appeal to design ease of use reputation functionality and most of all the coffee it ultimately produced made the jura swiss made extremely attractive i realize nearly for a coffee machine seems a little crazy to many but you do the math the short list included the slightly more expensive s with the dual heating elements for shorter down time but the touch control led won out for me no looking back i ve been extremely pleased with the f and the automated promps are a nobrainer 
friendly village i was extremely happy with this purchase i had delivery in two days amazing all the dishes arrived in perfect shape i would order again 
there is a reason they call it the animal we used it to catch a mouse in the house seriously excellent we used the thin attachment and reached behind the tv cabinet and we heard a small thud as the little bugger got sucked up we could see it in the container and it wasn t breathing and so it seems the trip through the tube killed him in the past we would chase the little critters around the house for an hour the cat has proven useless in these matters we like our dyson 
pressure canner does its job my wife has used this canner several times since purchase and it works just great we already have an older model but she wanted two as she does a lot of canning this item should last forever 
great skillet i really like the electric skillet it is the first one i have bought it is big enough to fry a chicken cut in half both halves at once and deep enough to make a stew easy to clean just like promised the only thing i was not so happy about was the handles they give a lot they bend and one of mine is already broken but that is really the only complain i have and i consider it a minor and would buy the skillet again 
the perfect little bowl i have recently become a fiestaware addict ! i started with these cute little bowls which i thought would be perfect for my three small children to use for my two year old it is the perfect size for cereal we also use these little fruit bowls to serve well fruit at the dinner table i also like using these bowls for quick candy or nuts dishes when guests arrive they really are so veratile they stack up nicely in the cupboard and the cinnabar color is unbelievably rich and pretty i just ordered several new pieces in other colors too and the cinnabar coordinates wonderfully with the plum cobalt and periwinkle 
i m cookin fer a livin and found this at an overstock price you don t want to know and snapped it up for heavy duty work at the restaurant it has performed flawlessly for the past months despite heavy use and abuse dinner for four sauteed with stock reduction in the pan no problem finish oz sirlions from flat top to oven no problem rendering duck breasts sauteing and finishing with delicate shrooms in demi no problem rockfish softshell crabs mussels in safron stock snap peas braised endive crepes you name it this pan can do whoohoooi scrub this one myself and then send it through my commercial dishwasher full of caustic detergent sanitizer and drying agent hundreds of times still looks new do not try that at home as it voids your warranty ima givin out mojo z for this tough guy ! 
best coffee i ever had best coffee maker but the price here is a bit much you can get the same bunn at target for under dollars check it out i got mine at target and a half years ago and no probles and i use it or times a day i paid 
love it so far i have gotten three hand me down machines in the last months or so the first my aunt couldnt get to work the second she said it wasnt even worth the attempt and the third was an absolute nightmare i was told on that one id have to take it to to a repair shop i said i would just buy a new one this is the one i chose the manual is pretty easy to follow and there are arrows on the machine on how to thread it im a beginner at sewing and compared to the other machines i looked at this one looks durable and just all around solid if i can figure this out so can you 
what an amazing price for such a great rug ! wow this is an excellent quality bamboo rug it far exceeded my expectations considering the low price i look at it and can t believe it was so inexpensive even with the shipping its an excellent deal ! if you are considering this rug buy it ! you will love it ps it looks fabulous in my tropical bathroom 
unbreakable and well made this coffee press is light weight and easy to use it cleans up easily and takes up little space in the cupboard it works as well as the more expensive ones and it won t break if it gets dropped in the sink 
works wonders this product truly works wonders no it doesn t harm your animal in any way the only slight down side is at least my dog does this the animal learns to bark soft enough that the collar won t spray 
all that i expected and more at the great price great little gadget for heating water i don t have to monitor it since it has an auto off the water is steaming hot great for a tea drinker like me great price too i bought this for traveling and heating water in hotel rooms i have been using it at home so far i am going to give it a spin travel this thanksgiving unbeatable for the i paid for it 
cookie cutter s i ordered various cookie cutter sizes and shapes i was pleased with them all they were shipped quickly and packaged carefully 
better than expected i received this coffeemaker as a christmas gift and was initially skeptical of the thermal carafe being able to make hot coffee and the basket style filter after using the maker for a week i have to say my skepticism was unjustified this machine makes great tasting coffee that is as hot as i could want it i never liked the cooked coffee that regular glass carafe makers produced burned tasting after the first cup the coffee from this machine is consistent from the first cup to the last i fill the carafe with hot water mill my beans and fill the reservoir empty the carafe and enjoy after two hours the coffee was still hot one great feature not highlighted is the front fill aspect kitchenaid designed the top with a channel to fill the reservoir by pouring the water from the front right next to the filter no more struggling to pour water in the back and see the water level extremely convenient i have to disagree with the previous reviewer this machine makes ten ounce cups after reading the review i double checked the carafe capacity against my old krups machine exactly cups more than enough for our household all in all a great looking great performing coffeemaker that meets kitchenaid s high standards i highly recommend it 
great sleep these pillows are the best they are so soft give great head support for the first time in years i did not wake up with neck pain from lack of support 
i bought another i don t have a dualit toaster but i do have a single wide slot cusinart toaster so i thought i d take a chance on this item itit works really well and i don t have a problem with regular bread getting squished like the other reviewer mentioned take care when removing your sandwich as its easy to forget that the metal is quite hot when taken from the toaster 
best foil cutter ever this is a nifty little gadget is a magnet on the fridge so is always easy to find cuts foil off instantly 
great quality i was very impressed with this duvet cover i searched a long time for a quality cover at a reasonable price i highly recommend this one it was super soft overall a good product 
yes goo gone works fine i got these figuring that goo gone would work and yes it works fine peel off the label squirt on goo gone wait a few minutes scrape off with a plastic spatula metal will scratch i can wash these in the dish washer without worry of rusting that plagues all other teflon covered cookie sheets i have owned plus they have a mirror finish and hopefully will never need replacing unlike teflon coated cookie sheets 
making the bags work when you have problems with the bags puncturing or with liquids leaking try using paper towels or wax paper to wrap the food items in wax paper seems to work best for the leaky liquid and paper towels seem to work best for food items that puncture the bags 
good product good price in comparison with other goose down king size pillows this was a good price product came quickly 
best foil cutter ever we ve been using ours for about five years now and it s the best foil cutter requires only one quarter of a turn to do the job as well as the most convenient ! it stays on the fridge with the magnet and is always at hand to do the job the cutter removes from the magnet part with a little squeeze so you always know where to find it ! this and an estate opener are the two wine tools that anyone truly interested in wine should own ! 
elite the best if you want to own the best buy this one ! i have bananas hanging on it now and they curve out so it does not touch any fruit in the bowl the bowl is round this is an impressive piece 
georgetown collection i bought this entire collection and was very pleased the console table is my favorite piece and i plan to buy more of these tables for other rooms of my house including using one as a desk for my laptop computer in the office 
yummy popcorn my family loves movie theater popcorn and this makes as good if not better popcorn than the theater ! since we purchased it we ve had popcorn every night ! love it ! 
perfect for single people as many people already know most food products are sold in family sized package living as a bachelor i was constantly throwing away stale dry goods such as various cereals pastas and coffee due to lack of use thinking of all the food not to mention money that was being wasted i decided to search for a cost effective solution i was given this product as a gift after mentioning my quest for freshness to several family members after owning this product for a while i realized just how many different foods can be sealed around your home and used later i have yet to get a bad seal from any of the canisters and have left items up to weeks with out having the seal go bad i recommend these canisters to anyone who wants to keep their dry goods from going stale and wasting mone 
not diswaher safe works swell put it in the dishwasher and the plunger ballooned out so i couldn t use it cleaning is a hassel it takes minutes to make juice and clean the machine 
a fantastic product the pepper ans salt grinders are fabulous don t understand why it gets so many bad reviews ! it works great gives out as much crushed pepper as a regular small pepper mill does and the pepper and salt coarseness are perfect too plus it is very handy unlike traditional mills where you have to rotate with both hands great product 
carry your dutch oven in style this tote bag is made to carry and protect your beloved dutch oven why a tote bag you may ask it not only protects your valuable or antique dutch oven but it keeps your otehr items clean if your oven has soot on the outside these come in different sizes just like the ovens themselves this particular one will fit a dutch oven up to quarts or in diameter which is the standard size used by scouts and other groups it has a padded bottom to protect the legs a heavy duty zipper closure and carrying straps 
attractive unit i like unit because it doesn t look like other typical media storage units and can also function as non media storage you do need to be careful when sliding the drawers out because they slide out fully and you don t want it dropped on your foot the drawers also need to be slid in carefully or it won t close fully the fiberboard sides aren t that attractive but it s not a horribly looking piece of furniture either and i ll probably paint it at some point 
does the job i got one of these for christmas and i love it great for small jobs picking up litter hair dust we ve even used it in our cars charging is convenient too no bulky cradle to worry about mounting on the wall there is just a plug also i was happy to see that replacement filters were available both from black and decker and amazon should i need them 
messy but worth it i agree that the cartridge was not easy to fill the beads are a little tricky to get into the cartridge they sort of stick to each other and to the bag they are in and to your hands so it takes awhile to get them packed in however the cost savings definitely makes up for the slight trouble separate cartridges would range from approx while this package of refills only cost ! well worth the extra minutes every months 
worth it these aren t great sheets by any means but for the price they are nice they re comfortable they seem large though i might need to try to shrink them in the wash to fit as well as my other sheets they feel thin which is actually very comfortable but i don t know if this is the microfiber part or if they are just cheaper sheets a good buy for a cheap nice extra set 
better than i had expected this is better than what i had expected shelves are sturdier than what i thought they would be 
not like an outdoor grill but quick easy we like it very easy to use and easy to clean especially if i remember to spray the grill as recommended before preheating i usually just soaked the grills briefly in hot soapy water and they cleaned easily they will go in the dishwasher but i prefer to do them by hand since it s so simple i found that i do need to clean the edges of the cut out oval where the grease runs into the drip pan which i was not expecting but still easy enough the hamburgers turkey burgers and chicken breasts were cooked quickly and were very good even though not the same as on an outdoor grill for turkey burgers chicken a sprinkle of paprika improves the color of the finished dish i also plan to cook a few extra burgers next time for a quick reheat in the microwave with no clean up 
wine glasses product came in great shape flawless and factory new and in less shipping time than anticipated 
my dog fights the cat for this toy let me tell you this toy is not only great for cats but also dogs the crackle factor is what they both love my dog and cat both fight over it i had to get more fat cat toys for both of them they also have dog toys made of the same crackle but bigger fyithe cat beats up the much larger dog 
ok toaster not an oven i bought this for the space saving feature which is terrific and it looks good i expected a toaster oven but it is really only a toaster it could use a little more power so that it would toast more quickly but eventually it gets the job done 
lasagna baker red this could possibly be the greastest deal i ve gotten on amazon ever the price i paid was a steal for the workmanship of this baker thank you amazo 
a great machine at a great price the box arrived bashed but my refurbished machine was packed like a newborn baby and arrived safe and sound i unpacked it assembled it in minutes without looking at the instructions plugged it in scanned literally through the book and let her rip ! in about minutes i was eating the best dessert imaginable see i wanted healthy low sugar non fat desserts i got a jug of organic black cherry juice talk about antioxidants ! from the healthfood store for about poured some into the freezer until it was about halfway filled added about a tablespoon of wildflower honey and turned it on i didn t really know anything about overrun which has to do with adding air to the mixture it turns out that this makes a fluffy creamy dessert without adding butterfats and cholesterol here in santa fe we have some swanky local ice cream that runs per pint they have exotic flavors like lavender and garam masala and chai frankly i ve got them beat and mine is healthier some of these reviews say how loud the machine is i don t find it so it s about as loud as my dishwasher and it is a soft serve ice cream maker which allows you to eat right away or store for later i used to have an old simac ice cream maker which was top loading like a washing machine and it was a devil to clean but cleaning this is easy as can be do you need an ice cream machine like this probably not but if you love to cook and you love to eat wonderful healthy gourmet food this machine transforms kitchen work into a relaxing and enjoyable hobby that brings health to you and your family and friends 
just perfect i worked in a laundry and dry cleaners when i was in college so i knew the principle operating techniques of this item but it still takes practice to learn positioning of the items and to keep from burning yourself no it isn t as large as the ones in the laundry but where would you store that thing any way and did you really think it would sell for under hundred dollars it works just as the instructions say just takes time to learn don t give up and soon you will be able to press very quickly i can do about a dozen garments in an hour and i don t repress with an iron

smaller size is perfect fit after reading some un favorable reviews i was a little hesitant to purchase this item my need for knife protection in a drawer that i wasn t ready to give up half the space to one of the larger trays on the market to nudged me in the right direction i got just what i needed with this knife storage tray safe storage for my good knives and of my drawer still there for the rest of my utensils 
love it i use mine in the closet where we have two litter boxes for our cats you don t realize it s working because you can t smell anything but i can tell a difference in the smell when the smellkiller runs out of water our condo is only square feet so you would certainly know it if there was a big mess in the litter boxes i have to go and check in the closet to see if it needs to be cleaned out i like the universal one because it seems to me that it would be harder to keep up with the water levels in the regular ones since the metal piece has to be in both water and air it seems easier to get the universal so you don t have to monitor the water level in the cup 
great bbq i bought this for my husband s birthday and he has been having a great time using it ever since he never cooks except on the grill outside so now he can use this inside during the winter he seems to be really enjoying using it and creating new things and that means i don t have to cook that night i recommend this bbq 
great juicer have bought several of these juicers for members of the family and myself it allows me to juice about anything only change i d make is a slightly larger mouth in which to put produce so that less cutting would be required but the results are great relatively easy to clean use mine to make healthy juices for my husband who has cancer the surprise to me was that healthy can taste so good use this several times a week and it s holding up very well after a year of use 
great but loud great dehumidifier works very well takes gallons of water out of my house i love everything about it except one detail it s loud i can t compare it to others as this is the only one i ve owned but it s the loudest appliance i own not a problem if you re putting it in a basement but maybe a bit much in a living sleeping area 
it is a wooden spoon i must confess that i do not use this spoon a whole lot but when i do it serves its purpose well i have no complaints 
excellent product received this product quickly as a direct amazon purchase love the teapot it is beautiful and as well as strong all my fine bone china teapots break easily not this one it is very durable love the color 
nice alternative to aerosol sprays i like my misto very much and cook with it frequently from spraying the bottom of a pan for stir fry or misting a salad it works perfectly everytime make sure you read the directions though i didn t and filled mine to the top and found that it would spray for two or three seconds and then squirt in a stream the box said it should mist for seconds so i went back to the directions to see what i d done wrong and sure enough you re only supposed to fill it halfway so that there s enough room for pressure to build if you cook with oil frequently and want a healthy alternative to those off theshelf cooking sprays this is the way to go 
wonderful winning waffles this waffle iron is the best ! i get nice brown crisp waffles every time i really appreciate the cooking control and the chirp chirp that tells me when my waffles are perfectly done ! i ve used many wafflers before but this is tops great price for the quality 
useful sturdy and stylish great way to eliminate the necessity for pam and other unhealthy kitchen sprays this oil sprayer is not only very sturdy and well made but very aesthetically pleasing to boot there s not much to say other than that as it s merely an oil sprayer i recommend it though 
great little machine after reading many reveiews on this product i decided to go ahead and purchase it i hate the public laundry so i thought this would be a little bit better even if i had some of the problems other people had mentioned i had the same problems with the screws that every one else did the screws dont match up to the holes to screw on the bottom panel you have to kind of force them in where they dont belong and then screw them on i also have to weigh down the water out house into the sink or it will flip out of the sink from the water pressure and end up all over the floor i thought it would be sufficent enough to just place it in the sink however i learned my lesson after the first load ! you can fit quite a bit in it despite the small size however i would not try to overload the washer as the water level will get too high and overflow i am able to wash with the water level on high as long as the washer is not too stuffed up overall if you can iron out the little kinks with the washer it is much better than public laundry and will save you a lot of money over the long run as opposed to the rolling thing for the bottom i got those furniture sliders and they work great to move it from one side of the kitchen to the next 
vornado model i purchased the vornado adjustable height variable speed model from the vornado website for i like the fan it does circulate the air when pointed to ceiling and makes the room cool it is also kinda quite it does make the air circulating sound but it not noisy but pleasant the only thing my wife didnt like is the black color of the fan they could make it in different colors it doesnt have any remote controls or oscillation like the other fancy fans have but overall we like the fan very much and it performs as mentioned and i would recommend buying it 
i love it i am so pleased with this product very reasonable price and excellent quality and looks good and feels good i highly recommend this purchase 
sleeping this pillow has been fabulous it supports my neck and yet it is soft i am getting a lot more rest then i was with my feather pillows 
good buy bought this for my mother as a gift for years she has bought microwave bags and was sceptical when i mentioned this idea well no more in her words its fantastic she says it s better because she has more control over the flavor and will save her money i think i ll be buying one soon to replace my aging hot air popper 
quality shears these shears have no problem cutting through chicken bones i have not had the problems other buyers have with the safety catch i highly recommend these shears at this price range 
nora pruiett this crystal is a great bargin for the money i choose super saver shipping i ve looked and can t top the quality quantity for the price so far i ve purchased the set of water glasses and the goblets this set is great and worry free when serving a large dinner that usually includes children if you like a heavy weight crystal this is it save your good stuff for the quiet intimate times also this crystal shows up the china quite nicely 
save the furniture we have three cats the mature one always uses it the new ones are not as into it yet but a little fresh cat nip helps i have been having trouble finding the refills in the pet shops thank you amazon 
works great the over cabinet door towel bar is a great solution for keeping kitchen towels accessible and neat just the right size for cabinets of varying widths 
holds a lot of water i had an electric water dispenser that held gallon bottles and decided to try a more economical alternative my main concerns were to have non clorine tasting water and to remove the hard water deposits that gunk up my coffe pot i fill the resivoir in the evening and put the dispenser back in the fridge to filter thru in the a m i fill water bottles to take with me for the day and make a half pot of coffee i love the amount of water this holds as opposed to a pitcher it s slim design fits nicely in the fridge and my water tastes so clean 
a nice simple design nice retro design really great colors i opted for the apple green my only wish is that it were a bit more powerful it is perfect for making smoothies which was why i bought it 
just right for me this did the trick for me it s fine for holding several skillets grill baskets and even a wok i have hung one wok one skillet one skillet and one skillet on it along with a grill basket in the back i believe there will be no issues with adding many more and it looks good and does not stick out too far in my small kitchen in fact it adds a touch of decor to my small kitchen i got the graphite and i like it very much it matches my black appliances very well installation was easy although one of my support bracket was bent after a little work it was okay it is a bit difficult to screw the mount to the wall if you are using a cordless drill driver due to the brackets being in the way a little but it s nothing real serious the main rear mounting bracket is designed to be mounted on studs centers and the holes line up fine there is one other mounting hole at the top which will not be lined up with a stud but is crucial the top mount will hold a lot of the weight and will need to be fastened with an anchor or equivalent all in all this unit looks nice and will help you out a lot freeing up space somewhere else i have found similar products that are a lot higher priced and seem to be the same i highly recommend this rack ! 
brewer product meets my requirementsmakes good tasting coffeeonly complaint it is difficult to put back the coffe filter holde 
tone is a thicker silicone i am very satisfied with this product and the red looks much better than expected the standard size is smaller than the custard cups i have been using so this is a good purchase for me is this frugal no but i did not own a regular size muffin pan and i prefer silicone to the cheaper nonstick metal panswould i have purchased this used at a cheaper price off of craigslist nodid i shop around for the best total price including the manufacturer s website yes and so should yo 
just what i was looking for i bought this because i wanted to divide gravel vacuuming and water changes into two separate steps so i could spend more time cleaning up my dwarf puffer aquarium it gets messy first i tried the pennplax air vac aquarium gravel cleaner which you hook up to an air pump but that didn t have much suction this battery powered model has as much suction as a normal gravel vacuum the kind that s just a hose and a tube or a water change kit like the python but it keeps all the water in the tank for you i had just one problem with the profile but it was easily fixed i thought i had to attach the adjustable tube item on the side panel of the box but this made it too long to work in my gallon and gallon long aquariums if the handle end sticks too far out of the aquarium the pump won t prime and you ll hear a buzzing sound and get no suction as it turns out the gravel attachment will also hook up to the unit directly without the extension tube the profile require c batteries for power and a rubber band to keep the sock filter from slipping off it will work with any aquarium from about deep up to or deeper if you don t mind getting wet update i ve stopped using this the reason is because it kicks up a lot of microparticles which pass through the sock filter and sort of fog up the aquarium so i worry about how well it really cleans it gets the big particles though 
decent vac but mine was used ok in all honesty i purchased this item simply because it combined with a full size vaccum that i was already purchasing qualified me for a promotional gift certficate greater than its price however it comes in handy for tasks such as cleaning out the car my old dustbuster doesn t hold its charge long enough to finsh anymore upon attempting use one of the included attachments with the device for the firstt time my wife was unable to insert it in the unit upon inspecting it i discovered a good chunk of what appeared to be a similar attachment already jammed down inside the vac i was able to crack it with a screwdriver and remove the pieces with a needlenose pliers it was the tail end of one of the attachments and had been obviously snapped off this did however make me wonder exactly who was misrepresenting the vac is amazon knowingly selling used equipment as new or is it their vendor used status aside this performed as well as could be expected for a device it sucks and in vaccum ery that s a good thing 
still going strong i got a good chef pizza stone as a wedding gift about and a half years ago i was still a novice pizza chef so it took me a while to get accustomed to the art of pizza crust the better my crust and technique got the more i appreciated my pizza stone crust is crispy and the texture is fantastic even with heavy moist toppings one of my favorites is a variety of cooked wild mushrooms thyme a little fontina and some prosciutto i am committed to healthy cooking so not having to use oil to prevent sticking is a plus i just scatter a bit of coarse ground cornmeal onto the preheated stone and it comes up easily of course pre heating the stone at a high temperature is the only way to acheive desired results and the more the stone is used the more non stick it becomes we treat it the way we d treat cast ironhaving a pizza stone is a great way to get brick ovenstyle crust at home and homemade is almost always healthier 
the best i have been searching for months to find a cover to fit my large ironning board no one carries one this is fabulous 
great quality backed by a great name i got these as part of our wedding registry here on amazon i chose them because of the price the name and the number of pieces i recently opened it after the wedding and wow so many pieces in the box there s the place settings serving pieces each place setting consists of knife fork soup spoon salad fork teaspoon hostess set consists of inch sugar spoon inch butter knife inch serving fork inch solid serving spoon inch pierced serving spoon pieces total ! it was wonderful and handy when we had guests over and our regular place setting set didn t cut it after wash and use when i put it next to my comparible inpricebutnotinquality mikasa set i can really see the differece they have remained very shiny and no water marks or rust so far im very happy with the selection 
roliing pin rings very useful in the kithchen makes pie pizza crusta in a jify without the worry of them being uneven dont know how i did without the 
excellent cookware prior to receiving this saucier pan for christmas i had only associated kitchenaid with appliances i am highly impressed with the quality of this cookware the saucier is solid and heavy food heats evenly and the pan doesn t warp on your stove when using high heats i use this pan as often as possible and am now considering replacing my current set of pots and pans with the entire kitchenaid set highly recommended 
great item this ice bucket is made of very thick glass and will accomodate quite a bit of ice the cheers martini pitcher as well as the martini glasses really round out the set ! i highly recommend this item 
handy kitchen tool for small amounts no need to haul out the big food processor i use this all the time perfect for salsa s and for mincing onions and garlic for dishes 
great product at a great price i am very pleased with this purchase and would recommend it to anyone who enjoys quality cookware 
i agree i agree with the previous reviews i do want to add a liddle aggravation to me in that it is made in china arrggh ! don t we make anything in this country anymore brand names do not seem to mean much country of origin might be nice in the official review that s the only reason i reduced my rating by one sta 
great experience solid product received exactly what i ordered when i expected it this is a good quality vinyl and pretty print 
helpful organizer these holders have been very helpful in organizing our garage allowing us to hang brooms mops shovels rakes and paddles on the wall and out of the way 
does it do everything no but close can you believe a microwave that will brown chicken i ve cooked things in this that makes me seem like a gourmet chef but i m not even quite an average cook chicken breast that practically melt in your mouth but the outside has a tantalizing crispiness that s sure to please the taste buds most recent to this review i cooked several rounds of new york strip steak a nice steak rub a bit of non stick spray for the rack and turntable tray makes for an easy cleanup and a steak lovers dream was created i do the typical hot dog heating in the microwave but you can t really place them directly on the metal tray if you want them to heat quickly they are slightly below where the microwaves really concentrate and take a few seconds longer to heat i place a microwave safe plate on the turntable upside down to elevate it slightly and it works much better this also works for microwave popcorn i had trouble getting it to pop in the minutes allocated to the popcorn button large bag it took more like put it on the upside down plate it pops in minutes and seconds yes i ve done enough of them to remember buy this one i doubt if you ll be sorry i got it originally because i was a full timer in an rv and was looking to replace a failed microwave oven after owning this for about a month i got rid of my toaster oven my rotisserie my jetstream oven and i can t remember what else it doesn t do toast that fast so i kept my toaster it is rather heavy and deep for a microwave but it takes a lot less space than all of the other appliances it replaces 
fish tank filters very good value and the filters arrived quickly the fish are happy too 
can t stop makin tarts this is a great tart pan if you like to make deep dish quiches etc the false bottom comes in handy for easy removal of the tart but be careful when loading it into the oven ! while the sides of the pan are non stick the bottom is not the sides and bottom should be buttered well i would reccomend this pan to anybody who has always wanted to made tarts 
my favorite appliance i have had my machine for several weeks and it rocks ! there was a wee learning curve my fault not the machine s but it is now turning out loaf after loaf of delicious fluffy bread i ve had absolutely no mechanical problems at all so far as long as i follow the recipe instructions who knew it was so important to use all room temp ingredients so the bread would rise properly i get a perfect loaf every time my family of bread loving men couldn t be happier and i really believe it is saving me money to make my own bread plus it is so much more convenient than making the trek to the closest grocery store which given where i live middle of nowhere isn t very close 
i love this product i really do love this product ! it is easy to use as long as you follow the basic set of instructions quick and produces a great hot beverage i don t have time in the morning to stand in front of an expresso machine and wait or use different special cups before i get my coffee the mukka lets you put everything together and before i am finished with breakfast it is ready a must have for any coffee or tea person oh and the instructions are right it does get better every time you use it 
excellent product product was exactly as described beautiful and obvious quality very satisfied with transactio 
great filter just put on an extra rubber washer for all you people out there who have a hard time stopping a brita filter system from leaking just pop out the washer from the original aearator that you just unscrewed to install the brita in the first place and add it on top of the brita washer ! then just reinstall it ! it s just that simple 
great product just got this in the mail today excellent addition to our gallon tank ! we have two red eared sliders and they are still pretty small this ramp will accommodate them until their shell is about inches in width supereasy to install fast delivery as well and item was packaged well 
great set of barstools i purchased these barstools about a year ago they were quite simple to assemble im not the best at assembling things once put together they were very sturdy the seat itself is quite comfy although the back of the seat does not provide the support that it boasts overall this is a nice set of barstools and can really add a bit of flair and style to a bar or counter 
ohh what can i bake today this is a gorgeous and powerful machine what engineering ! there is really nothing comparable out there i am not a serious cook but i may become one just so i can watch the beater go around and around in directions ! the color is fabulous kind of a retro green glass color iridescent it is way bigger than i thought it would be and very heavy it has earned a place on the countertop j 
not fancy but useful this item is not as fancy as others available but it is sturdy enough and it provides the extra surface area over the unused side of my sink that i bought it for it wipes clean easily 
black fabric shower curtain very pretty simple and elegant for your black and white bathrooms 
good but not wonderful i hate giving a less than perfect review but i have found this product to be a bit disappointing maybe it is me that is not doing something right but even after spraying it with pam i can t seem to get the cakes i make in it out without them falling apart in some way cleaning it is also more difficult than your more traditional baking pans however my daughter loves it and we will continue to use it until we figure out what works 
great surface i have an extra wide ironing board and the cover that came with it was so thin this cover makes a great surface to iron on almost make me want to iron ! 
a fantastically social meal when the focus of the meal is in the middle of the table it makes for a wonderfully social evening we first sampled raclette in france and loved it and could not do without the machine a great appliance 
great little sauce pan i got this as a gift and i love it great for cooking relatively small amounts of pasta it is sturdy and has stood up very well to being used almost everyday for several years the lid locks very easily on top and it is very easy to drain water out without burning oneself or worrying about the lid falling off 
this is a great knife i bought this knife after it was recommended in the book kitchen confidential the knife is razor sharp well balanced and it s very comfortable in the hand also i accidently nicked myself with it i was shocked both by my own stupidity and how flawlessly the cut healed because the knife was so sharp 
great purchase we have been using riedel crystal wine glasses and still do on occasion with the handful that we have left but i finally decided to buy spiegelau glasses for our everyday drinking glasses because we drink wine and entertain regularly our collection of riedel glasses has been diminishing although the crystal riedel s are beautiful glasses and still used for the right occasions they are extremely fragile and i have personally destroyed several while simply hand washing them at any rate after years of attrition via visiting friends and family we needed to stock up on new glasses because i hate to hand wash dishes i began to look into the dishwasher safe glasses from riedel and spiegelau for the new replacements i was going to just buy the dishwasher safe riedel glasses name recognition of course but i couldn t get over how much better the spiegelaus were priced moreover all of my favorite restaurants use spiegelau and come to think of it i don t think i ve ever seen riedels at a restaurant therefore i took the leap and stocked up on the chardonnay cabernet riesling port and champagne glasses i m really glad that i did all of them are terrific ! although not as elegant as the fine crystal versions these are excellent for everyday use and large dinner parties i ve already bounced one off of a granite countertop and it survived the collision without incident i ve also washed them all in the dishwasher several times and they ve come out great i am very very happy with this purchase i m sure that the comparable dishwasher safe riedel glasses are just as nice possibly nicer but you can t beat spiegelau s price ! 
works with booklite good combination i keep the booklite at the computer so the adapter is nice to have no worry about changing batteries 
the best cervical roll for me at least as a physical therapist who suffers from neck pain this is the only pillow that i can use without waking up to having cervical muscle spasms in the mornings this pillow is great for people who do not have the normal curvature of the cervical spine a ka straight necks cervical arthritis etc i bought one years ago at cvs have been looking for a year now for a replacement since mine cannot support my neck very well anymore it has been a week that i have been waking up to neck spasms i am delighted to find that it is here at amazon it was here all along i just have been typing in the wrong name cervical pillow cervical roll neck roll etc i am happy that i remembered what my year old son called it bone typed it and boy was he right 
very good product not perfect the zevro easy morning dual dry food dispenser is a very good product my five year old loves being able to easily get her own cereal cereal does leak out of the bottom of the mechanism if there is any left over in the mechanism after the bowel is removed this is not a real problem in the suburbs in a city apartment the cereal leakage from the bottom and the lack of an airtight seal on the top could be a problem for bugs roachsthe unit is stable and sturdy it is attractive on the counter 
pure luxury this is the blanket i have ordered several of the micromink type blankets only to return them disappointed but this one is the keeper and the best by far i bought two of these one for my son s bed and one for ours and got a throw for the couch ! love it love it love it ! you won t be disappointed with the softness and the weight is slightly heavy which i personally love great blanket

simple and excellent coffee i have tried many different coffee makers and being a coffee junkie i keep looking for the combination of simplicity cost and excellent coffee this has all three the first two or three times i tried this the coffee didn t come out that good either too weak or not enough body but now i have it down and the coffee is excellent i make a double espresso and then add in extra water to fill my travel mug for my hour commute each day the other good news i ve now found a good use for my single cup coffee maker it produce the right amount of water at the right temprature to use in the aeroexpress 
decent set for the right price this set of knives is beautifull they are sturdy and very well made the price is well worth the product and i think it s a great value for the money let s face it most of the time you get what you pay for these on the other hand defy that logic not by alot but defy it none the less i would encourage anyone looking for a decent set of steak knives and arent willing to pay the big to pick these up you won t be dissappointed 
love this espresso machine i use this machine every day even when my wife makes regular coffee i will quickly brew up a shot of espresso to kick it up a bit i use peet s italian espresso roast already ground for espresso machines and keep it in a vacuum sealed container it is a snap to fill the holder with grounds and pop it in the machine within a couple of minutes i have delicsious espresso with a nice crema on top the milk steamer works far better than my old machine and makes terrific frothy steamed milk this is the best espresso maker i have found to date 
an alien s perspective flawless teasteeping device probability of unplanned release of leaves into liquid medium during normal steeping processes is approximately zero in contrast to failure prone clasp of device tea ball high reliability values are obtained through the omission of moving parts and fabrication from corrosion resistant metal therefore it is probable that optimal item operation will persist beyond the cessation of original purchaser s biological functions therefore omitting aesthetic considerations the device possesses obvious heirloom suitability 
great i bought these to replace an old pair that had lost their edge and was pleasantly suprised at how sharp these were nice to handle and fit perfectly into the henckels knife block i already own

great bed for little animals my family has two dogs and i bought it for the older one but the puppy liked it so much now the older one just sleeps on the couch instead of her bed the puppy has claimed it as hers i didn t need to fluff it as i thought i would it holds the shape well and i liked the fact that you can wash the bedding inside using a washing machine 
good quality for the price this is a nice set of flatware there are many pieces that come with the package they seems like good quality flatware i am pleased with my purchase 
amazon has saved my coffee maker i loved it and i have found more things to buy from amazon i thought amazon is only for books and music i was wrong i am a regular coffee drinker and i can t afford to skip one i couldn t find the krups cup carafe from the manufacture s web site and were planning to trash my coffee maker for good fortunately amazon has saved my coffee maker thank you amazon 
great quality and wonderful for dieters it doesn t hold much this is made in indonesia to a high quality it looks wonderful no defects i could see and it is just the right size for a cup of yogurt small amount of fruit you get the picture it is not a supersize item if you need to eat more of some side dish or dessert that this plate allows shame on you i use it daily in many ways and just love its very popular pattern it s so civilized this is one of the items in old country roses i m collecting one day i ll have it all the problem now is to find the space to keep and or display them recommended 
i love it it looks expensive beautiful and heavy right size right depth for my needs i was a little concerned before i got it b c i was afraid to get a broken one but both pieces are fine highly recommended 
tv top shelf item as described and very easy to assemble arrived in a timely manner 
big this seems to be a great unit so far it cleans well without chipping which was my biggest concern when ordering one small problem is that there is a space between the cooking unit and the base unit which allows food to spill through the biggest concern i have to pass on is that this unit is really big the description mentions that the cooking surface is but does not mention that the base unit is wide so make sure you have a space to store it i had to store mine in my oven 
beautiful and exquisite i love this set this is the favorite of all my china teacup sets i have both irish and english bone china and this pattern is exquisite the color is beautiful so delicate i serve formal tea and scones with these teacups i love this set ! 
ultimate pepper grinder i have purchased several other pepper grinders out there and this one is by far the best it is inexpensive and can grind pepper at ease this is a life saver when you are cooking and seasoning with large amounts of pepper no more sore forearms from twisting or squeezing those unproductive pepper grinders out there this thing rocks ! 
dry clean only seems nice but i wish i had known it was to be dry cleaned only that will be difficult with a new baby and pets 
great buy arrived looking brand new all attatchments bowl and mixer in perfect shape have not used a whole lot making cookies and light duty mixing but am happy with the over all purchase 
out ! extra large deluxe puppy housebreaking pads i like these pads because they are thicker and larger than other brand pads this makes it very convenient when you have more than one puppy or dog 
great item fiestaware is great anyway but this piece is wonderful i use it for late night salads plenty of room for the big salad and if you want a great bowl for chips at parties or on football days like saturday and sunday a big roomy bowl that jethro bodine would have loved be creative and put what you want in there the color is electric and goes great with alot of things
