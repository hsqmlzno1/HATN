mediocre in every way this was a seventh anniversaty gift and being made of copper is its only real benefit two of the welded connections between the rings were broken upon receipt and it s light and relatively shabby in construction its difficult to find a th anniversary gift made of copper and to that end this fit the bill but its real value even for the intended purpose is very limited 
not up to expectations i bought this product in december after two months of use about once a week the on off switch broke eventually after using it for a year and trying to get hoover to correct the problem just before christmas i got quite a fright when i started smelling smoke whilst using it i discontinued the use of the product and asked hoover once again to please look at it their reply was that i should take it to one of their authorised shops where they ll repair it charge me then hoover will see if it was in fact a factory error and only then refund me when they feel they re not in the wrong please don t waste your money on this product it is defnitely not worth it it is noisy vacuums carpets well when used to work but is unable to vacuum floors at all one of the options on it sorry hoover but you have lost a loyal customer my whole family for generations back has always bought hoover including myself 
awful changing the canister which you have to do once for every large room is a messy undertaking even if you re careful dust and dirt slide out with the canister dropping a mess onto the floor you just had to roll the hoover windtunnel over several times to get clean what a waste of money 
the colors come off after using it for couple of times hi the pieces look real good however after using it for couple of times the colors startcoming off it then looks real drab and i am bit worried ifthe paint is harmful to you since it keeps coming off id not recommend it irrespective of the price 
nice but not sturdy broke after less than months a seal isn t holding anymore and won t hold pressure for more than a few seconds doesn t seem to be repairable 
shark sweeper this is a great sweeper but its tragic downfall is the short lifespan of the battery we bought one a couple of years ago from sears with a sears replacement warranty since then we have replaced it five times we really got our money s worth from the warranty at least ! its getting to be a joke one day usually months after we bring home the new one the rotor just stops turning and that s all she wrote next time we will purchase a different sweeper warranty or not 
annoying inconsistency th product features and editorial review spell germany as the origin of manufacture but the one i got was made in china 
not happy with this sweeper pros lite weight easy to use long battery life cons cat hair gets wrapped up into the coils and is difficult to clean out does not pick up all of the dirt and hair spits some of the dirt back out when you pull it backwards when you press the off button dirt comes out of it i will not buy this sweeper again 
it would be great if packaging was better first off a big thumbs down to the packing of this product mine arrived in the mail broken and the box was full of holes due to a lose product inside the box because of poor packaging ! i wonder if i lost something in shipping not sure because the box was half empty with only the product and a tiny instruction booklet it made me realize just how cheap this product is made boooo to amazon for selling such a cheap product for soo much money this makes me question if amazon com is such a great place to do my shopping 
cannot boil water useless this does not get hot enough to boil water no matter how long i leave it on makes it useless why bother with a burner if only possible heat setting is low and lowersome customers found that it worked initially before developing its problem as to my experience i don t have memory of mine ever working properly i bought this a few years ago and had it in storage not having need for it at that time then i pulled it out last month for basically its first use no boil water no go it is straight to the landfill for it annoying disappointment 
big disappointment this pitcher did not withstand the test of time we had it for approximately two months when the area where the handle connects to the pitcher began to crack we never handle it rough nor even put it in the dishwasher 
will not keep an edge we finally broke down and went looking for a complete set of quality kitchen knives the name wushof came up several times and we purchased a set of them they work well until they started getting dull sooner then i thought they would i have numerous sharpening stone ceramic diamond and buffing wheels and sharpened them myself to a razors edge again they worked well but soon became very dull we were very careful in the storing and handling of them which made no differance they are well balanced looked well made but are over rated and priced the mac japanese knives we have stay sharper longer take abuse better and sharpen easier 
not worth the money i paid baring the calphalon name i was expecting something really nice especially for the price i paid through amazon of boy was i disappointed although amazon is selling it as high quality piece the calphalon contemporary stainless quart saucepan with glass lid is clearly on the cheaper side of the calphalon brand it looks like one of the pans calphalon gives away to get you to purchase their higher end cookware the item arrived nicely boxed in the calphalon box but when i opened the box the pan looked like it had originally been a return item before it was sent to me the pot and lid were both in orginal packaging but the lid was clearly broken it looked like someone had taken a hammer to it and stuck it back in the box and sent it on to me amazon has agreed to send a replacement at no charge but i can t believe they would have sent something like this to me to begin with without first inspecting what they send out unless it s being given to you as a freebie i suggest you save your money 
ultimately delivered as promised the package arrived days after placing the order and the tamper was tossed loose in the box without any packaging there is no way to track the package in fairness to the company the tamper is of high quality and was not damaged in transit overall while i am very pleased with my purchase i tend to expect more from an on line merchant than what was delivered 
bad warranty policy my collar stopped working after months innotek doesn t honor their warranty unless you buy from an authorized dealer which doesn t include amazon 
alp the top doesn t seal so shaking and storing the dressing can only be done with tinkering also the bottle being so narrow it s hard to clean 
not very happy the carafe has a plastic insert with a strong smell there was no instruction how to pull it out instructions were very general incomplete and written in not very good english i did not get any response from the factory so i did not have a choice and had to return it also for this price the outside of the top should have been plated better 
waste of feels nice fresh from the package despite the loose threads poorquality sewing i m sure after washings they are starting to pill they have also shrunk and fitting them on the bed is now a very tight squeeze definitely not tc and definitely not egyptian cotton waste of 
lid is a problem this percolator would be great except the lid was too tight and extremely difficult to remove after only about a week the gasket around the glass window in the top cracked from having to pull the handle so hard to get the lid off and coffee leaked out through the break as it perked i called customer service and they said they d replace the lid but it is on backorder i have been waiting for over two months now i don t know how you are supposed to get the lid off without using the handle though so what s the point 
not as described walnut tradition kitchen scissors asin bamr do not have comfortable wood handles secured with triple brass rivets they have unattractive chocolate brown plastic handles the bottle opener and screw driver extensions are a poor design feature and simply get in the way 
the handle is quality but the whisk it s weird the handle is so nicely designed with rubbery grips and that handsome emeril logo then you have the whisk part which is kind of cheaply made rough plastic which loses it s shape easily you d hope the manufacturers would put the same effort into the actual whisk as they did in the handle but not here its not a bad whisk for the price but if you want a nice whisk and are willing to spend a couple more dollars buy something else 
looking for a waffle iron don t stop here what happened to the research devolpment team for the cuisinart waf r traditional waffle iron they must be out eating waffles at the notorious waffle lady house of waffles the noise this waffle iron makes when your waffle is done sounds like a smoke alarm going off and oops they forgot a volume control you will burn your hand on the handle if you put in too much batter plan on the batter going in to the many cracks and crevices the design team thought they would add just for annoynance sake the waffles we made turned out flatter than any pancake we d ever made boo hiss come on cuisinart you can do better than this 
a waste of money spend the extra and buy cuisinart i bought the hamilton big mouth in november just in time to use for all the extra cooking i do through the holidays i didn t have the money to spend on a cuisinart at the time so i thought i d give the hamilton beach a try after looking at the reviews here now this is my first time using a hamilton beach food processor as i ve worked in professional kitchens and have always used cuisinarts and i m used to them being work horses that can plow through any kind of food you process at first things were going great it survived through a thanksgiving for a christmas for with the last thing made was a large batch of gingerbread dough i put the machine away and just brought it out to use for a weekend s worth of cooking and it s dead we ve troubleshooted through everything but to no avail i guess this product would be fine if you only cooked occasionally but for the frequent home cook who occasionally also does large meals i d seriously suggest getting a better and more sturdy brand 
don t bother horrible ! only two cutting wheels does not fit on bottles with an extra wide neck flimsy i would guess that this will break in a month or two stick to a screwpull 
norpro stainless steel oil mister junk will not pump after only a few uses 
terrible this is not a high end luxury towel by grand patrician and is not ultra in any way even if they were firsts they are second rate mine started to self destruct after the first wash and never had the absorbency of a wet dish rag am disappointed amazon would carry this product which would be a bad deal at half the price next time i will look for more reviews 
fling it squirrel although the body of the squirrel is still intact our pug tore the fur off the tail of the squirrel the first day he had it he still plays with the body and there is nothing for him to choke on but i was disappointed that it fell apart so quickly 
received both leak from the top i received two of these for christmas i tried them both both leaked liquid from different spots when turned to pour also the plastic tops had touches of gray worn looking plastic on them i returned them both and bought of the zojirushi champagne gold series tall thermal carafe herb cacao carafes instead which work great 
wrong bowls sent and returned twice billing a big question i never received the large bowls the small cereal bowls were sent twice quickly but wrong size both times and i returned both orders i was sent an e mail stating something significant was wrong with the system and i would not be receiving the larger bowls then i got an e mail saying i was being billed for them to which i replied what i received was not what i ordered and had been returned twice i have all the paperwork on both orders the plates i ordered were never received at all i have no idea what is going on now it makes sense that i be allowed to talk to a person at this point but that isn t happening eithe 
rival no customer service i recieved one of these for christmas i would love to tell you how it works but it is missing a plastic piece now to be fair i lost it in the confusion of christmas it must have gotten tossed i called rival to purchase a replacement piece what a joke i emailed no response i called they don t know what i am talking about even though it is clearly listed in the instruction manual or if i get a rep who does know what the piece is they say they don t have one to sell but if i want to pay to ship the unit back and forth they will replace it i have left voice mail messages for non existent supervisors so instead of being happy to pay for my own mistake of losing the piece i will return this to the store as defective and get the money back they lose a sale the store loses a sale they get in return an unhappy former customer and a defective unit do not buy rival products we need to start showing these big companies who hide in voice mail hells that we are tired of poor illogical treatment 
physics is against the pestle as you can see in the picture the pestle the part you hold in your hand has quite a wide bottom unfortunately this spreads out the force that you can apply to any single location making it practically impossible to grind seeds eg cumin to dust i tried it once on cumin seeds and gave up 
hate this coffeemaker i ve had this coffeemaker for two weeks i bought it because i had an old mr coffee that worked fine but was white and stained i liked that this was black and looked sleek the very second time i used it the off button stuck so you can no longer turn off the machine but have to wait for it to turn itself off also every pot has grounds in it i m using the filters that came with it and have never even filled it to capacity and i can t figure out why there are always grounds in my coffee piece of junk don t buy it 
mostly filler my cats used to like this food because it is basically junk food for cats i did not realize how unhealthy most of the big brand names in pet food were look at the ingredients the main ingredients are corn and grain fillers and animal by products is there even any real meat in this stuff check out the ingredients for high quality dry foods like innova evo or felidae and you will see a big difference in the contents and their order the good stuff has real meat as the first several ingredients this stuff is basically doritos in pellet form for cats and is far from what a carnivore cat s natural diet would be yes because this stuff is mostly filler it is cheap the real cost is to the cat whose health might suffer in the long run from eating junk food 
i was ripped off and i think knowingly the tupperware was useless because the top was too small for the bottom i am left to think that this seller is running a scam i wish someone had told me before i threw dollars down the drain 
butter dish not tall enough it looks nice but the lid touches the top of the butter and sticks to it 
misleading product i should have taken more time to research this product after opening the box tonight i realized that what i got was not the fountain it was just the resevoir i will be returning this item 
not so elegant sheets after only one usage and washing pilling of the material made reusing them uncomfortable when i tried to return them i was refued because days had expired we hadn t used them until then i have a balance in my account to use other than that we will not be buying from amazon anymore imagine if we were to buy early gifts for someone which had been in our plans also i have since read other complaints of the product with similar responses yet you still sell them 
looks better than it works looks super cool right with bag cleaners all you have to do is remove the bag and put in a new one with this you have to realize the suction isn t working the barrel will not be close to full removing the barrel is easy but you have to spill everything all over when you open it to dump it then you have to remove clean the sub filter very dirty jobs the brush head is too tight and doesn t drop down to the floor level properly so the brush isn t even in contact with the floor most of the time avoid this until they get the kinks worked out updatemy wife called their customer service they said that it wasn t supposed to be stiff and immediately shipped out a refurb replacement it s working fine though is does have a small bit of stiffness id change to stars if i could 
eh they re ok when i opened the product the sheets really were soft but when you re laying on them they aren t very comfortable i wouldn t buy another set again but they were cheap so not a horrible buy 
piece of junk take it from a norwegian avoid this product at all costs if you are seeking a real krumkake iron it is not a solid cast iron device look elsewhere for quality 
fantastic don t buy this fan unless you can put up with noise it will make on high speed also if it has green lights like my blizzard fan did it will light up a dark room at night also you will see the fan shadow on your ceiling low speed is quiet enough for sleeping but high will disturb you the angle tilt adjustments are not precise and are difficult to do there are better choices 
slow messy overpriced i was very excited about this product when i ordered it unfourtunatly the product didn t meet my expetations it is extreamly slow much slower than a george foreman which really surprised me also as another reviewer wrote it is very messy i never appreciated the design of a foreman until i used this the sides of the cuisinart do not extend past the cooking surface much so they don t block any spray and when you open the griddler any condensation or food residue can slide off the back onto your counter because of where it is hinged in conclusion get a foreman 
it s better than them being in a tiny cup i agree that this product is too small to be the best home for a betta but i think the betta would say if it could please put me in this instead of the tiny cup i am in now i have had bettas in gallon tanks and in small bowls and some do like the smaller bowls better 
good looks bad quality i bought a blue one the mug looks nice enough but it cracked the first time i filled it with hot water for tea get your act together guys it really is not so difficult to make dishes that can withstanda little heat as for the claim that this can go in the microwave after the mug cracked ididn t bother to try 
terrible quality a really unfortunate purchase two years ago i purchased this hand crank ice cream freezer for on the web my wife and i loved the idea of kids taking turns cranking the handle but the very first time we made ice cream we found that the crank would jam incessantly if i pressed in on the handle in a certain way while cranking the jamming was reduced a bit but this was a nuisance if one did not apply force in just the right way the thing would jam again so much for friends and kids enjoying taking turns at the crank ! the second time we made ice cream the jamming was even worse and we noticed that metal filings were dropping down from the gear mechanism and were making their way into the ice cream when i took the gear mechanism the crank assembly frame apart i discovered the problem the gears inside are designed and manufactured badly the gears are not held in place but rather have about play that is a lot of play when the gears drift apart they jam the gears in our unit were badly gouged after only two uses ! the gears seem to be stamped from low grade powdered metal the entire problem could have been avoided in the manufacturing by simply using a plastic spacer on the shaft that holds one of the gears but this was not done when i called about warranty service i was told that a replacement gear mechanism would be shipped to me that never happened the next time i called some months later i was told that there was no record of my earlier call again i was told that a replacement gear mechanism would be shipped to me about a week later a replacement handle arrived not a gear mechanism the third time i called about warranty service i was informed that gear mechanism is not actually a replacement part so that i should never have been told that one could be sent to me this is rather baffling one can buy the part on the web i was also informed that the unit was out of its one year warranty it did not seem to matter to them that my problems with the unit and my contacts with them had begun while the unit was only a few months old only when i assured them that i was holding in my hand a printed year warranty did they continue to work with me of course the company is fully aware of their flawed product and of course they are fully aware that the product has been sold with a year warranty it seems that they try to bluff people who call for warranty service hoping that they might not have a copy of thier warranty in hand the result of this third call about warranty service was that the company agreed to replace my ice cream maker under warranty but i was required to pay for shipping of my old unit back to them via ups an expense of and for shipping of the replacement unit to me an expense of so the cost of my ice cream maker is up to luckily they don t have any of the hand crank models available to send out as a replacement and so they are going to ship me an electric model instead i m hoping the electric one will be a better design it does not have the gear mechanism that the hand crank model has but i certainly would not have paid for an electric ice cream maker my recommendation would be to buy a much cheaper electric ice cream maker of a more modern design from another company 
no high marks for this one i have never really reviewed an item but always read so here s my donation no evengrinding in either mill one holds salt the other pepper without lots of fussing with the screw nob at the top to adjust the opening some peppercorns come out broken in half while others are appropriately ground peppercorns get caught in the grinding mechanism in the case of the salt mill again uneven grinding it may be because the sea salt i have in there seems a bit more moist than bone dry my chief complaint is that when you use the mill you need to adjust the screw on top with every movement thus you get what i mentioned the case of the uneven grind !

gaggia espresso machine the machine works as advertised but i was very dissapointed in the quality of construction while i fully understood that the machine was constructed of plastic and not metal i did expect that the plastic pieces comprising the body of the machine to properly fit together the machine was a gift and so i could not return it otherwise i would have 
failure i purchased two of this item for a total of four space bags i used them according to the instructions putting less into them than the commercials indicate within days all four had leaked not one kept the air out 
don t buy this coffee pot i got this coffee pot last christmas and it worked great for about three months now it takes min to brew cups and it sounds like i live by an airport i have cleaned it but that isn t the problem i did have to buy a new one since i couldn t deal with the noise or waiting so long for a cup of coffee 
great machine no support its the service after the sale that counts i confess i like starbucks i like to have my cappuccino made for me i also like to make my own on occaision this machine worked well for a while and then it seemed to be clogged after a couple of months of not being used there were two available options for service one company in my whole state who was hours away and the manufacturers rep in ny i chose ny i didn t get it out until after the year was up although i had gotten a number at months they charged me to fix the machine claiming that i did something to one of the hoses gaggia esspresso is a great machine but don t expect service if something goes wrong i laid out over for the machine which i rarely used then another bucks to get it fixed when it should have been covered by warranty next time i ll buy another brand i won t reccommend any other one because i don t want you to think i work for a different brand i don t 
this is the best thing ever man this item is fantastic i love wasting on pointless furniture getting a great cheap plastic looking set that holds all my games and systems man i must be in heaven not only that but it breaks easily does this thing have no limit so i bought this great video center around a year ago and what happens it breaks i had it for a couple of weeks and does it look like dog crap it looks like you re in a baby kids room similar to those play centers in day cares or mcdonalds man that is lame i just love having children decor in my house and it has to be if i were you i would just let my systems tv and cds sit in some tubberware believe me it would be x safer ! 
marvelous cookware set i love the cookware set pans to do different meals they are very durable and holds up well to the heat 
death trap for smaller fish i installed one of these in my aquarium this weekend and sat back looking forward to lush greenery in my tank the system is a sturdy canister in which you mix sugar yeast a stabilizing agent and water these do their thing and the gas comes through a tube down into a bubble track that makes the bubbles zig zag up exposing them to the water for as long as possible good concept and i d read pretty good reviews but here s the problem the track affixes to the wall of your tank with suction cups which create a narrow gap between the tank wall and the track i noticed my tetras were getting in there but since they were getting back out i didn t worry then this morning i found one of the larger females firmly stuck i thought she was dead until i released her she swam off with an ugly red mark where the thing had caught her i hope she s ok i removed this death trap from my tank and am seeking safer ways to diffuse the co in my tank the canister thing is nice though particularly if you re not handy enough to make an airtight seal with a diy soda bottle system it might get another star for that but seeing how it injured and could ve killed one of my fish i d like to give it update after several aquarist friends insisted that i must have improperly installed my diffuser i tried again this time making sure the suction cups were squeezed as flat as possible and one of my friends checked it and assured me that this time there was just not enough space to admit even a small fish two days later i checked the diffuser and there was an otocinclus trapped behind it this one was dead find a better way to feed your plants 
guarenteed leakproof lid and drinkproof beautiful mug and the coffee stays hot when they say leakproof lid however they really mean it even in the open position nothing comes out can t figure out if it is possible to adjust the lid we have to drink our beverages with the lid off which defies to whole purpose of travel mugs i took advantage of the year warrenty and the replacements had the same problem apperently as the gasket on the lid heats up it expands then the seal is just as tight as if it were in the closed position we are very unhappy with this product and i wish to give it stars 
too sharp i have been a homemaker for almost years and i have a lot of experience peeling vegetables i am fast and have rarely cut myself however i bought this peeler during the holidays and a few days ago i cut myself so severly with it i thought about going to the hospital this peeler seems to slide over the food quicker than others i have used and so it some how gives me an quotout of control quot feeling with each thrust it is also extra sharp i can t recomend this unless your fingers are made of stainless steel as well 
product stars packing stars hassle star great looking set if they could arrive here without being broken amazon how can you continue to ship these out to customers when it is so obvious that the manufacturer doesn t pack them well enough for shipping amazon then simply throws that poorly packed box in an amazon box with not enough cushion and away they go any rough handling at all resorts in the canisters banging each other and you end up with a broken box of ceramic i ve received two of those lovely surprises the first set i ordered and the replacement set oh boy i give up the canisters are packed one inside the other with a thin piece of cardboard separating them just imagine the ups guy throwing the box or even setting it down hard they break amazon is however good about issuing a credit or in attemting replacement in this case so it s like playing the lottery to see if you can get lucky and receive them without breakage are you feeling lucky if so then roll the dice 
not happy with the set the picture shown on the package is not on the sheet set it is the picture that is on the comforter because it was on the package i assumed it would be on the sheets the picture is of figures wielding lightsabers only the pillow case had this i was very dissappointed as this was a gift for a grandchild sandra laport 
save your money i have owned this litter box i d say about months now i have to tell you this is such a cool concept ! however i would be happier had i just set my money on fire i d sure be a lot less stressed at least the first few days it worked fine i was so excited my cats suprisingly used it and i had no problems at all i thought i was in heaven but such is life all good things must come to an end it started erroring everytime i used it sometimes for no reason it would all finished drying the granules and everything would be dandy and beep beep beep so then i d hit the button and it would start all over again to be honest i think this is a built in scam just so it uses more of that solution and you have to buy more which btw i m pretty certain that solution is nothing more than a gimmick so they can get more of your money the bucks just wasn t enough but anyways back to the errors it would error every time i used it every time and it would always be a different error i d fix it which btw it drains like crap and then go on about my day well one day i forgot it was running and went over to my neighbors i was there about hours ish when i walked outside her door to my annoyance i could of course hear my so awesome cat genie beeping in error and to my even worse annoyance apparently the long term beeping kept of my cats from ever wanted to go near it again so of them kept trying to go outside to use the bathroom and she s not an outdoor cat and the other one just took it upon herself to pop a squat wherever she felt comfortable now fast forward about days ago my cat genie just stopped draining altogether stopped i walked in and saw that it was about to overflow the one time it doesn t give me an error beep so i frantically turned it off and tried to fix it it didn t work i tried again and tried for about an hour when finally i accepted defeat and took it apart and dumped the water most of it got on my floor which i was ecstatic about since that s what i was trying to prevent in the first place went to my computer and e mailed the company that was about days ago and i ve not heard back from them since so i assume they re realizing what a huge peice of crap they re selling and hopefully they either fix said peice of crap or stop selling it altogether because i m not happy that i spent so much money on such a huge worthless peice of junk like i said it s a cool concept but it just plain doesn t work and for the people on here that it did work for congrats but bucks is too much of a gamble for something that just might not work stick to the regular old litter box for now that s where i m back to 
relatively thin poorly constructed cheapo towels i got a pair of these from amazon because the price was right or was it turns out that even at a bargain basement price these towels were no deal they re relatively thin and poorly constructed they shed like crazy and i suspect they ll be dust in short order not that they re gonna stay in my house long enough to find out these are hardly luxury quality towels i made a mistake with my money now i m trying to help you avoid the same mistake put themousedownnowandwalkawayfromtheterminal 
another white one i too just received my petite casserole in white too i thought after reading that many others got white by mistake that the problem would be corrected i am returning my white casserole and hope that i will be able to get the red one that i ordered

love ceramic cookers but his one is a poor value all the things people say about ceramic cookers are true they are the best way the cook foor whether you want to do traditional bbq low and slow for at degrees or to grill steaks at degrees they keep the heat and moisture in due to the thick ceramic walls and keeping the temperature adjusted is easy whether grilling or barbecue the flavor is unmatched by steel cookers all that said for the same price as this large bge you can get a kamado that is much larger has thicker walls and can be had covered with beautiful mosaic tile of your choice not only is it a thing of beauty but it the way it cooks is incredible using a lb load of kamado natural coconut extruded charcoal it is possible to maintain a constant degrees for more than hrs without adding more charcoal this means you can do traditionl bbq with primal cuts such as full lb briskets and lb pork shoulders and sleep through the night while they are cooking 
the worst coffee machine ever i bought this because i liked the idea of having the water filter inside you can t find replacement filters you can t measure the water correctly i tried just pouring water in from a cup that didn t work because it goes right into the water filter so it looks like it is at level when it is more the last straw was the other day as the water started to brew through the basket the basket sprang open i had water everywhere it also seems to take a while to brew a small pot of coffee i usually made a or cup pot and it took minutes i will never buy a coffee pot from this company again 
i feel let down i really trust the reviews i read before purchasing an item ! this one was a letdown ! the sheets were soft at first i washed them before putting them on my bed and there was an enormous amount of fuzz and pilling of the sheets on the second washing no improvement and probably worse i am so disappointed in the quality ! the only good thing i can say about them is the color is pretty and has not faded with the washings but so what with all the pilling and fuzzs that accumulate at the foot of the bed avoid these 
my impression dear customer service i am please about the refund i am please about all thinks that i purchase from you the web page where i bought zelco itty bitty book light volume i believe is not clear by looking the page i had the impression that i was going to buy a mini lamp where i was able to use the adapter for volt and the lamp is a led lamp at list this was my impression sincerelyadrian 
not so great i am totally unimpressed with this set of bowls i received them a few days ago and washed them and one has already managed to crack after falling of the drying rack and into the sink a melamine bowl should be far sturdier than this the orange measuring cup bowls towards the center are nice but the outer bowls are rather flimsy 
pretty but too delitcate i bought this item as a holiday gift it is a very beautiful piece and is artisitcally designed well when we went to set it in its stand however the lip of the neck brushed the wire frame and chipped ! i was shocked that it broke so easily it s possible that they connected at just the right point and it was mere coincidence but i am not getting another one to find out beware 
wish i had another slow cooker my husband bought this for me for christmas i was thrilled to get it since i had an older smaller model i had never burned any food in a slow cooker before i used this model i couldn t figure out how to get it to cook slowly i finally called customer service and was told i wasn t using the right kinds of recipes she told me that the pot had to be at least full i used her advice but it still boils everything on every temperature level i use it to make roasts and that is all it sweats horribly and i have to put it on a cutting board so it doesn t burn my countertop the handle cracked after months my biggest ahha moment was when i came home after a long day out there had been a power surge and it had reset itself my whole meal was ruined and that is when i realized the value of a dial knob slow cooker just back away slowly from this one 
nice while it lasted as with the reviewer above i purchased this fan from another store and it worked well at first the remote was a nice touch and the fan speeds and settings worked well however within months of owning it when we tried to have it rotate it turns slightly gets stuck and proceeds to just make a clicking sound until you stop it from rotating needless to say it no longer rotates so it is now just a stationary fan i even tried taking it apart to unjam it but came to discover that the rotating gear was already worn down and that was the problem so without new parts it could not be fixed buy another fan if you want it to last i know i am 
description your description of the popover pan did not did not contain quotminiquot the item i wanted was the standard size popover pan not the mini quotminiquot should be added to your description 
not sateen even though it says that these are sateen they are not i sent them back because they weren t and could find no indication that they were for the money though the sheets seemed to be nice and amazon did a pretty good job of refunding my money promptly 
bad bad i received the first topper and it was not satisfactory so i called and was sent another one which was worse than the first discolored etc i have since returned both pads in the same box 
get the same thing for this is a very cool product but there are a million knock offs out there these days and you can get them for as little as ! they are almost totally identical they look just as cool they work just as well and the only thing that the knock offs don t generally have is the fancy wooden box cost plus world market sells one for and linen n things sells one for some companies just don t get the idea of appropriate pricing 
beware before you order you need to know these are plastic plates they are not stoneware or quality plates i did not see any references in the description of the plates that they were anything other than a natural plate i now have to send back everything that i received and the prices of these plates are priced the same as quality stoneware plates such as fiesta which is what i intend on replacing them with except i will go to a department store and purchase them i wasn t expecting anything but quality platewear very disappointed in the lack of description on these plates all i can say is if you re expecting a quality stoneware type of plate this is not the one 
workd well then quit this kettle worked well although noisily for about nine months then it just quit the indicator light would glow when turned on but the water was ont heated i would not buy this model again 
kaput after just months as several other reviewers said the clock lost several minutes a week requiring that it be re set periodically this was tolerable since the coffee it made was decent then about months after i bought the unit it stopped working altogether the on light would illuminate but nothing would happen i only use this pot once a day hardly heavy use this shouldn t have happened 
buy from someone else i checked the proflowers site and it said i still had days to order the flowers to ensure they got there before christmas it s now the day after christmas and they still haven t gotten them 
terrible this is not a high end luxury towel by grand patrician and is not ultra in any way even if they were firsts they are second rate mine started to self destruct after the first wash and never had the absorbency of a wet dish rag am disappointed amazon would carry this product which would be a bad deal at half the price next time i will look for more reviews 
have a big dog not worth the money i have two great danes who love chew treat toys especially kong i brought the everlasting treat balls home and they both were able to pop out the treat within minutes ! they enjoyed the treats but the expensive plastic ball is useless i will be returning this product tomorrow 
a bit annoying to use i like the style since it s different from the typical shoe rack but shoes are always falling off this thing it doesn t fit boots or many types of dress shoes and it s hard to squeeze men s size shoes onto the different tiers without knocking shoes off a different tier 
hunters toys chewed the knobs right off held the ball down with his paws and chewed all the knobs 
do not buy from amazon consider yourself warned do not buy this set from amazon ! i ordered it on and amazon has since then emailed me every days to inform me that there has been a delay in the product s arrival in order to keep the order active you have to go to the amazon site and approve the delay this is what i ve been doing for months now ! i ve emailed amazon twice about it and they credited me and still don t have the product in stock that they are supposedly selling to people save yourself the headache amazon doesn t actually have this product buy elsewhere submitted 
too easily broken i have a habit of wiping the edge of my wine glass during dinner when i wiped one of these with the edge of a soft napkin the glass broke 
it wasnt delivered im sure i would have loved it if it only had arrived now im just a bit poorer than before 
this product sucks if i could enter a for this product i would the back of the matress pad is slippery and moves when you turn in bed also the binding around the sides is non existed this is by all means the worse product that i have purchased at amazon co 
will not last this waffle maker broke at the two hinge pins within one year of purchase parts are not available top is hinged to bottom with two small plastic caps that are poorly made at best unable to repair had to throw it out 
it sucks this kitchen timer is really cute and i had to have it to match every other pink kitchenaid appliance that i own and love but you simply cannot hear it when the other review said that you couldn t hear it from the other room they were being generous you literally can t hear it from like feet away unless you really concentrate so buy it if you just think it s cute it is but still you will have to buy a timer for your kitchen or you re gonna burn the cookies 
poorly and cheaply manufactured possibly a fire hazzard i received this unit the first week of november by valentines day it was toast no pun intended at first it worked fine i used it to warm the end of our big living room near the front door where it is was almost always cold i set the thermostat at about maximum and left it to work it was also completely quiet as advertised then sometime in january i noticed that the on off knob was turning brown near the edges as if discolored by excessive heat i turned it off to investigate then turned it on again nothing the unit was dead after repeatedly turning it off and on i noticed sparking underneath the switch after repeatedly spinning the switch between off on it would finally come back on and would stay on for or days until it failed again after about days of this i unplugged it out of fear for my family s safety now it waits in my garage until i can take a trip to the dump and dispose of it what a giant hassle for a dollar heater ! and don t doubt for a second that honeywell counts on people not wanting to hassle with returns another example of an electronic device made as cheaply as possible with little or no regard for quality or safety it will be a cold day in you knowwhat before i purchase anything else from honeywell i better find me a quality heater soon so that day never comes 
fun toy for light chewers this has the potential to be a great toy there are two squeakers that make two different sounds and also some crinkly stuffing in part of the dog however in less than an hour my dog was ripping the stuffing out and that was after i had amputated the chewed up ears and tail even though i bought his on sale these things cost too much to last less than a day 
this thing doesn t suck the one item in your house that you really wish would suck and it certainly doesn t this thing blows more air than it sucks dirt what a useless thing i m looking for one that will actually pick up the dirt from the recessed areas of my prefinished floor this thing certainly doesn t do it ! if you re looking to buy this thing look again there must be something better if not just your regular broom 
mini mixer vs aerolatte edited review stars i tried to change the of stars to in this edited review but couldn t the mini mixer mm is cheaply made even by current chinese standards doesn t have a switch you just press a plastic thingy against a metal reed to make voltage contact length of mm with frother is length of aerolatte al is weight with batteries mm g al g mm motor is as powerful as the al mm shaft is thicker than al shaft the al has a little circular whisk on the bottom the mm has a dime sized disc with little teeth a degree angle to the disk surprisingly the mm frother disc generates less drag in liquid and spins faster than the ae i believe the mm actually does a better job it frothes like hell i give the al stars mostly for apparent quality durability and the mm stars for outstanding cheap performance 
didn t fit low quality most of the time i get a good deal shopping for bargains on amazon but this wasn t one of those times the sheets were mediocre quality that would ve been fine had they fit properly but they were exceptionally baggy and the elastic was weak waste of my money 
inconsistency this is made in china not germany it is an exuberant amount to pay for a product that did not cost much to make 
inferior quality and sitram poor customer service after months of use the handle holder on the lid came off due to fatigue at welding joints since the other pieces also uses spot welding at the handle i m fearful for my safety and contacted sitram customer support this is their response while we have the ability to authorize replacement for the defective products that have handles coming off we are unable to satisfy a request to credit other product that has not shown signs of being defective in otherwords they re not surprised the product is defective and i m not the only one complaining if i m stupid enough to buy a whole set then i ll have to return each item as it falls apart too bad if the defective will maim me in the process stay away from this defective and inferior product if you value your health and safety btw i contacted amazon customer service and they agreed to accept the return love amazon 
tropix tumblers tumblers keep drinks cool but do not appear to be very durable compared to tervis tumblers one tumbler was cracked upon receipt 
drippy tea kettle i paid too much money for this tea kettle to drip from under the spout and spit water all over the stove before it even whistles this is a disappointment ! save your money and search for a better kettle this one isn t a good buy or a good produc 
do not buy this product i bought this set of four stoppers for use with my metrokane rabbit vacuum pump because i was not getting good results with the two that came with the pump with the stoppers from this set i was able to form a seal and create a vacuum however the vacuum lasts only a few hours no matter what bottle it was being used on i do not recommend this product 
buyer beware i ordered the flying bird cat toy the color combination they sent me was unbelievably hideous purple base and pale pink and pistachio green bird ! their delayed response to my dissatisfaction was i would have to pay shipping back to them for credit thus i would have two shipping charges to return this item why would they produce an item that is so ugly especially when their ad shows a lovely color combination do not order from these sellers without clarifying exactly what you will receive 
very disappointed after slightly over a year the liner developed a couple of chips and upon closer examination two cracks along the height of the liner these developed the last time i used it in one use and for no apparent reason though i love the way the cooker looks i ve never used it for anything other than slow cooking so its versatility is useless to me even if a replacement liner was available i would worry this would happen again with food inside so i m going back to the stoneware style which lasts many many years 
it s ok but definitely not as good as expected they say this is so amazing because nothing sticks to it it cooks food better than regular pans odors don t stick to it it s easy to clean well they got out right at least it is easy to clean but it is impossible to coook almost everything in it because everything i ve tried comes out burnt on one side not even done on the other side on the cookie sheet everything around the outsides burns in the cupcake pans or the cake pan the top of the food cooks but the bottom doesn t it is very hard to get smells out of it and with a lot of stuff you still should spray it with cooking spray or it does stick a little i m sure in some ovens and with certain foods they work great but my experience wasn t so great 
i sent this knife back this knife was dull upon receipt i sent it back although i loved the handle shape and color 
broke in months i should have followed the advice of most of the reviewers here before i purchased this humidifer there was a large mineral buildup but that was the least of it worked fairly good for three months but then it stopped working one of the controls literally froze in place and the machine was unusable no way to fix it had to throw it away what a shame next time i will pay closer attention to what people write my advice by something other than a honeywell i have three packages of filters that i purchased separately another waste of money 
very small for a pair of kitchen scissors the description claims that these scissors are good for use in the kitchen but i think that needs some clarification the cutting edge of the blades is only about an inch and a half long ! the torque engineering that is referred to can surely only mean that the handles are longer than the blades and so providing a gain due to leverage other than that there is nothing really different compared to regular scissors when the description refers to chicken bones does it really mean just chicken ribs and cartlidge the pivot is a simple rivet pretty basic and cheap for a relatively expensive pair of scissors such a simple rivet also means that you can t take the blades apart the scissors do work ok as regular scissors i e for cutting paper plastic packaging etc but no more so than any other reasonably well made and possibly less expensive design 
worked great until it died i have always had first alert smoke alarms and they always worked great and lasted for what seems like forever in fact i have never had a smoke alarm die until now when i moved into my aparment years ago my first alert smoke alarm was there already and to this day it still works i only changed the alarm because of new laws a year after i started using this one it died on me i was very disappointed in the longevity of the product 
don t buy if you drink more than cups at a time i was trying to go retro my old coffee pot had a grinder builtin my new one did not so i decided to purchase this hand mill it is not very easy to use and does not grind very well plusthe tray where the grounds are deposited is very small and tends tocause a mess it is on my kitchen countertop as an ornament i wishi would have returned it 
wrong ptcture the picture is of the cubic foot mode 
it really sucks ! and not in the way it s supposed to moved into a new home wanted a brand new vacuum for my brand new carpets decided to try a bagless model this thing is a total waste of money it has barely any suction whatsoever especially when trying to use the hose so for now after running this thing i have resorted to getting down on my hands and knees and raking my hand in a circular motion one square foot at a time across the carpets to pick up lint and people hairs and fuzz from a brand new carpet that this thing just couldn t suck up it s ridiculous its a brand new vacuum ! i have never had to do this with any other vacuum i had my husband make sure it was working right and it is it just has a very weak suction this thing is going back to the store and i am getting my money back and using it to buy a better vacuum don t waste your money ! also i have always vacuumed my bare floors instead of sweeping and this thing is supposed to work on bare floors well they all pretty much do that job but for some reason this has a bare floor setting whoop de do ! it wont even pick up a little dust on my bathroom floor nor can it suck up a cobweb ! don t buy 
inch fagor gasket i was shipped the inch size gasket which does not fit the inch lidand needs to be returned please advise as to how i can exchange this forthe proper size item 
organize everything is a poor supplier for this product i ordered about of these boxes to place family photos in i obviously could have continued to store them in the cardboard boxes they were in but i wanted something better for treasured items i did receive them promptly but the box they were shipped in was not packed properly and all of the boxes were damaged that i could live with but one of the boxes had obviously been sitting for a long time in some warehouse because it had mold on the inside and the two metal rivets inside were rusted the inside of this box smelled like an old musty basement i emailed my complaint and stated i would like some type of adjustment because of the condition that was over a week ago and no response since then i see the local menards store has them on sale for each when you buy two at a time i won t be buying anything from this vender again problems occur and not everything can be perfect but what makes all the difference is service and with this vendor i ve gotten none 
disapointed with kitchenaid the toaster does not seem to cool well between repeated toasting cycles only with the heat control kept the same the second toasting is much darker than the first and the third will be almost burned 
oxo good grips tea kettle the tea kettle has a nice shape and the whistle works fine but the inside of the spout began to rust within the first month 
its fun and all but i am a recently instant step dad to a y o rottweiler and thought i d get her some fun new toys this nobbly wobbly looked cute opened the box yesterday morning and she was sooooo excited to play with the ball bbbbbuuuuuttttttttdont bother this ball lasted not even hours before it was torn apart kind of bummed i didn t read the customer review before hand sorry charlie well find you a new toy 
awful these canisters are such a disappointment they looked beautiful when i first bought them but the finish has worn off just from sitting on my counter and now they look terrible i finally bought canisters after many years of not having them and i thought these would last but they look dreadful 
does not work nearly as well as the original after reading the other reviews i am wondering if i have a defective model here is our experience with this machine weve had a floormate since we loved our original floormate so when it conked out we bought this model it does not clean the floors at all ! the new and improved brushes don t even touch the floor most of the time it doesn t suck up the excess water as well as the older one so you re basically just pushing dirty water around the floor we are so dissapointed we ve went back to cleaning on our hands and knees 
you get what you pay for this is a cute vacuum and that s about it the filter clogs and they are next to impossible to find the canister is a pain to empty the biggest problem i found was there was no height adjustment if you have thick carpet you just need to forget about this vacuum what a nightmare to push and pull this stupid thing mine has gone to goodwill 
bad idea i got the filter for the humidifier i also just bought upon placing the filter in and turning the unit on a strong odor filled the room i had to open the windows to air the room out because i didn t think inhaling the smell was a good idea being that it was for my bird s room i feel sure that it would result in him getting sick or worse i believe the problem lies in the protec antimicrobial treatment i would never have bought it had i known about this 
very poor quality i am bitterly disappointed with these towels i was expecting high quality cotton fluffy ones and instead got very average quality they are virtually indistinguishable from the ones i buy from k mart for of the price 
pasta maker the first time using the product it got jammed and i have not been able to open the machine up due to its malfunction i need to exchange it for a new pasta maker however i do not have any of information to do it it was thrown out by mistake could you please send me information on how to exchange the machine for a new one and then i could be better at rating the product 
simply bad this is horrible at keeping coffee hot it gets cold quick buy another brand i bought this model and a larger zojirushi liter stainless steel model at the same time they both are bad and leak heat vapor out like a hissing snake with no off switch the ltr one also leaks fluid out even before you press the open button also it is the worst stainless steel i have ever seen it stains instantly and for ever i had another zhjirushi for more than a decade and it was fantastic but something has happened over the last years their quality has really gotten bad 
anything but soft this set is anything but soft the set is also very heavy washed several times and never got softer the only good thing is they are plenty big for a pillow top matress not worth the price 
black decker gr i also hate this griddle ! it has a very poor non stick surface i keep hoping it ll season but after months i m giving up i also tried rival and they are even worse ! i will try presto based on someone else review 
save your money buy a better quality the quality of this isnt great the sound of the waterproof material is loud i dont like the side material and think it will fall apart easily i would save your money and buy the more expensive one that has better quality 
does not hold oz much smaller than it appears does not hold oz i gave it away for christmas instead wishing for one of those old oz aladdin coffee mugs they used to sell or give away at i have one old one it keeps my water cold and i do not have to fill it often 
rust on bottom appeared after first use i was disappointed by this toothbrush holder after putting it to use for just one day any drops of water that run down the side of the holder or end up around the bottom edge due to splashing runoff from the bathroom sink immediately seem to trigger the bottom of the holder to rust ! i tried to keep the splashing to a minimum but this thing started leaving a rust ring on my bathroom counter within a couple days i still use it since it s a nice looking easily cleaned toothbrush holder but i keep a coaster under it to protect the sink counter i wish i could give it more stars since i love the look functionality of it but i have to give it only stars since i think making it rust proof is only common sense for something that sits next to your sink i wonder if all the steeltek stainlesssteel products rust so easily 
wireless intercom the unit did not recieve or transmit half the distance that was reported across a flat surface ft would be pushing it 
buy a different brand star is too many for this one dogs and cats react only because the sound is novel to them the device i received and the replacement after that were so low powered that some animals walk over out of curiosity some don t react at all and the ones that it scares is only because the new sound startles them i had a chance to try a different brand years ago and i know from that experience that this brand is a toy in comparison if you think this will protect then give it to your kids and watch how fast they get themselve eaten there you go suicide by dog that s a good use for it may be it is just quality control you might get lucky if not then you might have to deal with a seller that won t return calls or e mail like i did so you bypass by finding his supplier and get a replacement that is just as bad go to the website and they are obviously throwing away the bad reviews they get and posting only favorable ones i hate being cheated score another point for the bad guys 
scratched on first use the box and inside materials say that metal utensils can be used but after a single use my metal spatula created deep grooves all over the surface the pan was ruined very disappointed 
cannot adjust for coarseness the description says you can adjust for coarseness of the salt pepper but there is no such knob on the mini grinders we replaced the store bought salt with sea salt and now the grinder doesn t work disappointing 
bread toasts well but bagels and muffins are bad based on all the glowing reviews here of this toaster i went and purchased one it does toast bread just fine but it is absolutely lousy on bagels and english muffins one half of the same side too dark and the other half of the same side not toasted at all figured that i had a bad one exchanged it for another and it does the same thing i am very puzzled how it can do so poorly on round items but it does tried inside in inside out always the half closest to back of toaster burns before the half closest to the front gets any gold at all 
an ill conceived affair it s hard to describe what a mess these shelves are what you cannot see from the photo is that it is held together with plastic parts that allegedly snap together but they simply don t stay together you will need a large empty room people still you won t ever get it together i bought it for use in a closet but it s impossible to move it into the closet because it falls apart every time we attempt to move it so you can imagine that it can only hold very light items since it s ugly i can t imagine any other use for it but the closet but it s ugliness is not the main problem which is that it is simply unusable 
wait for version a great idea but falls short for the cat it needs to do more maybe if it turned around in circles the whole thing ocationaly and had a speed control unless i am holding it and moving it myself my cat simply stares at the beam or sniffs at the toy 
poor substitute for original patton high velocity back in the mid s i bought a patton inch high velocity fan although this fan i am reviewing uses the same name it is not at all nearly as good as the original the original actuallyhad three different speeds while this one uses three speeds they are hardly distinquishable from each other the original was of heavier gauge and would not topple as easily as this new version the original fan model had a fan which cut more deeply because the fins stood out more and hence the original blew the air much more powerfully than this new version oh yes the original s lowest speed was actually quiet whereas none of the speeds on this new version is quiet bad substitute and mediocre fan 
defective broken machines in a row stay away after using an inexpensive krups machine for years my wife gave in and we agreed to buy this delonghi ec the st machine we got had a cracked plastic water tank and a broken tray delonghi customer support is outsourced and worthless andreplacement parts were out of stock and backordered we exchanged it for another and the power button did not work to keep the unit on you had to physically hold down the power button finally the third machine we got was totally doa ! it wouldn t even turn on finally we were told that they were getting alot of these machines back and customer service told us to steer clear buyer beware we went back to our krups so far 
bad teapot design i am giving it two stars because at least it looks attractive but beware fill the pot with tea and the spout starts spilling ! yes the end of the spout is considerably lower than the top of the pot thus it spills tea all over the place when you make a full pot i am amazed that apparently nobody tested this design before it went into production 
smelly plastic i thought this was a neat idea but silicone in the oven is not our house smelled like plastic minutes into baking a cake in one of these at degrees in the oven the cake was ruined the silicone cake pan smelled of the cake even after a thourough washing i like my silicone pot holders threw out all my cloth ones that were a fire hazard but i have to say that i don t recommend cooking anything in silicone pans use air bake double insulated non stick pans instead which are tried true 
star for a mazon i ordered for xmas dinner was sent three and they cancelled the th one saying the will never get it in thanks amazon 
terrible packaging the item itself was lovely and of good quality the problem was most definitely the poor packaging the beautiful metal cradle that is included rattled around and dented and even chipped the wooden bowl multiple times i ordered this product twice even giving the reason for my return of the first salad bowl the second one i received was packaged even worse this was very inconvenient since it was to be a christmas gift i suspected it the second time so i asked the ups guy to stay til i looked at the item itself lo and behold it was once again damaged and i sent it on its way on the spot anyone ordering this product i advise you to do the same ! this situation forced me to do what i was trying to avoid last minute holiday rush traffic jams everywhere shopping 
totally worthless i bought this vac to replace an older dirt devil stick vac that i had for about ten years i really liked the old one and thought i was getting a more powerful version of the it the new one is more powerful alright but all the power is situated in one tiny section of the floor brush if you don t aim that section right onto what you are trying to pick up forget it i agree with some of the other reviewers on the noise level it s so noisy i feel i should be wearing ear plugs also i can t figure out what s with all the air that blows around while you re trying to focus on your one little area i think that s where all the power goes dust debris and hair blow all over the room im going this weekend to buy a new stick vacuum that works maybe i can sell this one in a garage sale my advice to others is do not buy this product i only rated it with one star because i had no other option 
the convenience isn t convenient at all cuisinart s ad copy and product directions claim that the charger can be kept plugged into the wall so it s always ready for use however this is a nickel cadmium rechargeable battery plugging it back in to recharge before you ve fully drained it is death to nicad batteries ! this stupid design decision on the part of cuisinart almost guarantees a poor user experience 
office chair well i purchased chairs thru amazon when the chairs arrived that were exactly what was displayed very nice but after two and a half months the chairs gas lift broke on one of them i sent an email to the vendor on and still have not heard anything from them i run a buisness and use this chair for our frontdesk i was hoping this matter could have been taken care of with a little more customer service ! i hope that in the next couple of days they will get back to me regarding this purchase and rectify the situation 
doesn t feel like sateen these sheets say they are sateen but they don t feel like it they are no where near as soft as the sateen ones that i had before they also don t fit my matress quite right however they do feel like they are of a good quality and would last a long time 
cheap product i bought the item and as soon as i opened the packaged i was wondering if it was going to work and if so how long it would last needless to say after about hours of use the item just stopped working i beleive it had something to do with the cheap button used to turn the product on yes it was a cheap toy to buy price wise but i guess i got what i paid for 
loose lid the ceramic is slightly cheap and the lid doesn t fit properly so it s kind of pointless because it is a travel mug ! the cobalt blue is a nice colour i bought another mug through creative ventures through amazon and it was cheaper and the quality was much better 
anti microbial feature is false item states an anti microbial feature however mold buildup ocurred in about weeks thus have to replace every weeks instead of the manufactured recommended of months this week replacement frequency has been consistent for the last months for me will look into getting another humidifier that is not made by honeywell 
outstanding product i am extremely happy with this product it works like a charm for making pancakes and they never ever stick it s a superb design and i am very pleased i would highly recommend it 
spice rack i bought it some time ago for much less also from amazon it is not worth may be 
too small and awkward while cute this little pan is difficult to use there s no room to use a spatula so you d better like the eggs cooked through you can t flip for over easy and the egg white is too deep to do sunny side up also the handle gets hot and the little plastic egg bit is not enough to grip so you have to use a potholder plus it s so small that it won t fit any normal sized burner another burn risk to your fingers 
they don t function i hated these shakers i got them as a gift and they are too big and take up too much space and the rubber stoppers were not a tight fit so the salt and pepper was always leaking out the bottom and the holes in the top are too big and too much comes out at once finally one broke and i was thrilled to toss them out the other smaller fiesta ware ones the round ones are much much better 
server only this item is for serving only it will not keep the liquid hot or cold more than mins 
not worth the price one reviewer mentioned that rust spots occurred the same thing happened to us even though it just sits in our kitchen also the foot pedal broke on it after about months why bother paying all that money if it s just going to break and look awful you might as well just get a one from walmart it last about the same amount of time the closing machanism is quiet however and it is easy to remove bags from the can 
this toaster is like jack inthebox not only does this toaster burn toast on one side even at low settings the force of the toaster has a tendency to projectile bagels and particularly toast onto the counter and if positioned close to the edge of the countertop on to the floor we are very disappointed with this purchase 
pike street solid flannel queen nicw soft sheets but will wash away after not too many washings one of the pillow cases is already coming unthreaded after just two washes 
tree storage bag the storage bag was too small despite saying it fit up to a ft artificial tree 
do not buy if you have hard water i live in utah and purchased two of these for my home within a day everything was covered with white dust on calling their customer service they asked for my zip code they then informed me they are not recommended for my area due to the hard water and to return them to the store unfortunately not before the dust had got into my computer hard drive and dvd players rendering them virtually useless why distribute them in a hard water area in the first place this is a law suit waiting to happen i purchased one evaparotive type of humidifier from sears for half the price and there is no dust whatsoever and it is maintaining a comfortable humidity throughout my house 
cat owners beware these sheets are indeed much more wrinkle resistant than my old cotton thread count and very expensive sheets but are much thinner surprisingly suggesting more delicate threads this fact was borne out when less than a month after starting to use them one of my cats kneaded on the bed with his claws and the sheet was irreparably shredded this has never happened before with any sheets i have owned in years of multiple cat owning sure i ve gotten thread pulls and tiny little holes in other sheets but not the knife like cuts that appeared with these sheets after just one kneading session it really looked like someone had taken a pair of scissors and stabbed the sheet repeatedly despite the high thread count this cotton is thin and delicate so beware if you are a pet owner you do get what you pay for with these inexpensive sheets 
a lot of money for a very little don t be fooled by the name emeril on this knife this is a light duty knife at best the blade is extremely thin and has little or no weight spend a few extra dollars and get a knifewith more quality and more weight 
knobs too big for some mugs be sure you are planning to use this mug tree with large handled mugs small mugs like those that come with dinnerware sets may not fit over the knobs on the ends of the arms also two of the arms did not screw in properly 
anolon quart stainless steel covered stockpot i used my new pot to make fig pickle and it did a super job ! it is deep enough so i didn t have to be concerned with boil over and as the figs and vinegar have to remain in the pot for a number of hours after cooking i decided a stainless steel pot would fill the bill i would recommend this stainless steel stockpot without reservation ! 
sandpaper these sheets feel like sandpaper they didnt fit my pillowtop either thankfully so i had to return the 
problems with bulters pantry dishes i received a piece placesetting of these dishes for our wedding after using the dishes for about six months cracks have appeared in the glazing and edges have chipped flaked off bowls and plates the dishes have not been used extensively and it appears that even light everyday use by two people is too much for them lenox recommends using low temperature dishwasher setting and low temperature microwave use even following those instructions our dishes have cracked and chipped when i called lenox to complain they told me they would have to send a formal letter of authroization at which time i would be asked to mail them the damaged dishes dinner plates nine bowls and one salad plate one of their quality control specialists would examine the dishes and call me back i would not recommend this line from lenox i am awaiting the authorization letter but overall i am very disappointed in this product and the company that buit its reputation on quality and high standards i would not recommend these dishes 
not bad for the price i bought this to avoid buing and expensive mandoline to make my sweet potato fries what i leared is the sweet potatoes are too hard for this cutter to work well neither my husband or i could get the sweet potato to cut we had to take it out and chop them by hand it works very good on regular and smaller potatoes though 
can t review the black decker power scrubber because i can t get it i assume that amazon s refusal to ship the power scrubber to an fpo military overseas address is because the batteries are included for the us asking price i d be more than willing to get the gadget without the batteries i m in japan folks it s not like there are no aa batteries available here now here s the kicker i can buy it here in japan from a tv shopping network just up the road in hiroshima so how the heck can they get it shipped here batteries or no when i can t the price difference btw is locally vs from amazon 
great for a while but then it falters i loved this item for a long time it is quiet and not unattractive but i have had it for a year or so and now it is not working the pump seems to be broken because when i add water to the resevoir it stops flowing and sometimes days later it will suddenly turn back on it is also difficult to clean in certain parts that are hard to access for scrubbing but good at trapping orange mold i also bought one for my neighbor a while back and her cats refused to use it 
not for your car i purchased this steamer for use on my car inside and rims but this steam cleaner is virtually worthless for this use dirt and grime only sprays away when the nozzle is directly on the dirt therefore for hard to reach places it does not work well furthermore the steam is not that hot a few inches from the nozzle i can hold my hand in the steam directly under the nozzle i cannot but i was under the assumption that the steam was significantly more powerful that this now that i am resigned to the fact that i have to keep this unit i tried it on my shower and it is not all that impressive there either scrubbing bubbles work better 
did they listen hamilton beach has ruined an expellant product the trueair cool mist humidifier by making the replacement filters so badly a big disappointment the filter gets moldy after a month of usage making the operation very expensive i hope they come up with a better solution i dont know what happend but the the latest filter has last all winter and still looks new 
can t afford to shop like this toaster was defective had to send it back cost me in shipping and i have nothing to show for it 
it s too thin on its leading edge and warps i love my other silcone spatula s by mario but this one is not what i expected the edge warps and it is very difficult to get it under a pancake for example and turn it over it literally was sticking and tearing the pancake and i was using a non stick griddle i think perhaps it needed to be a little less long so there would be more support for the food item not sure what the warping problem is cause i have only used it once to try and turn the pancake and washed by hand i tried putting a weight on the leading edge and leaving it weighed down several days but when i checked to see if that fixed it it was still warped 
leaks and cracks we have used pur filters for years now not by choice but because we are always able to get a new one by calling in to the company because the unit either cracks or falls of the faucet before the warranty is up the company is very good about sending a coupon for replacement with any pur faucet mounted unit the filter is junk the free filters in the future kind of make up for that if you don t want the hassle go with another filter 
a piece of junk i purchased this device specifically to juice wheatgrass first of all the suction cup at the bottom is worthless and the clamp is clumsily engineered and can only be used on a counter with a big lip on it which in my kitchen is in front of the dishwasher with the dishwasher s door open which looks rediculous then in order to get any yield whatsoever one must crank then reverse then crank again to have anything come out of the tiny hole near the crank another design flaw on top of this it takes almost a whole x tray of wheatgrass just to make two one ounce shots and that is with the compression cap screwed on the end something is wrong here they only use half that amount at wild oats with their champion juicers juice leaks out the handle out the front and everywhere else except where it s supposed to go in the cup after doing this a few times and making a huge mess of grass clippings green staining juice all over my countertop and me and a tedious minutes to set it up juice the grass and clean up it s better i just stay with going to the local juice bar and spending the three bucks i know i should not be angry because you get what you pay for but geez this device was endorsed by the hippocrates health institute and i trusted that endorsement 
overpriced garbage i find it more than a bit ridiculous that pur charges dollars for their product and dollars for their replacement filters i have owned pur sink mounted water filters and every one of them has ended up in the garbage within the first year of use why because they begin to leak at the faucet connection and this leak grows progressively worse over time tightening the unit does not help and in fact may make the leak worse removing and reinstalling the unit does not help i have become so frustrated by pur water products that i will never again purchase anything made by them i just installed a brita filter on my sink a couple of days ago and no problems yet and even if any do occur the brita is more reasonably priced at up to dollars cheaper for the sink mounted unit do yourself a favor and avoid this over priced piece of junk at all costs 
tiny bookstand after reading several reviews i only read one that was negative i concurred that perhaps one person just had different needs well as soon as i opened the package i realized just how right the negative review was this book stand would hold up a children s soft cover back any of my school books are not stably supported i would actually have to hold up the sides of the book to read the pages unless you have thinner hard back textbooks the hard back will support the pages this is not worth buying especially not for make sure you realize just how small this bookstand is if that is with you need then this is the one for you 
nice name poor performance i recently purchased the new waring juice simply because i knew the name and quality of products they typically produce this juicer does have a larger feed chute which makes juicing easier but there are these three metal bars inside to prevent people from sticking their hand in machine these bars obviously are there for safety but caused my food push to get stuck in the machine while juicing spinach and created a suction action i had to wiggle and use extreme force to extract the food push from the machine i also tried to juice pineapple and green apples two of my favorites but the machine over heated i had to follow the instructions in the manual that covered overheating throughly now i know why they devoted so much time to overheating as this happened twice with me i could only proceed after unplugging the machine and waiting minutes with no luck and then after ten minutes i was ready to go again also noticed that the pulp container had large pieces of apple skin about the size of a fifty cent piece that was not juiced the food chute is justified to one side and also caused all the residue in the filter to collect on one side so the longer i juiced the less juice it yeilded the machine had two speeds at last but never stated how many rotations per minute occured while on high or low overall disappointing 
poor seals generally speaking the design is a good idea too bad the bottles don t seal well the lids are poorly maufactured designed and do not seal properly as a test i put water in one of the bottles and put the lid on nice and tight then turned the bottle on it side and watched the water run out this is not good for spices as they will not keep well if the container is not sealed 
dissatisfied i received this item in the description is stated is was inches long when in reallity it was unable to use still sitting in the box unused tried to contact the given by the rep to return to date no luc 
clean immediately after use or experience mold i got one of these attractive looking boards and treated it with a beewax based wood maintenance product the board sucked up very little wax compared to my other boards after a good meal with friends i was prevented from doing the dishes right away and the board ended sitting for two days before cleaning by this time it had collected mold that is situated deep into the surface of the board and which i regard impossible to remove i haven t and didn t experience this with any other board the board looks good without mold and is very resistant to cutting marks but if you decide to get one you should probably make sure to clean it right away after any use i do not know if this is a general characteristic of bamboo or a quality of this particular board i would have appreciated a word of warning or a useful guide as to how the board needs to be treated differently from boards made of wood for my next board i will probably try to find an end grain board made of american maple american maple is significantly harder than european maple tor 
disappointing i have a shep akita mix but i bought this more for my coonhound who will eat anything anything ! especially if it s made out of food i put the treats in the ball thing and she licked it a couple times and lost interest the problem with this toy is that it s hard for the dogs to get a grip on the thing the shape is putting them off she later tried to knaw on it with the side of her jaw but got so little out of it a taste but nothing to chew on or savor or act like a reward that she lost interest which is saying a lot since again she will go to great lengths for the smallest crumb finally i took the treats out of the ball and offered them to the dogs instand results they are working away at them right now i think the lesson here is that this toy will only work well for dogs that enjoy chewing on hard objects that don t break into pieces easily if they do at all some dogs love this ! not mine apparently so if anyone wants to try it with their dogs email me i have one never been chewed ! maybe your dog will like it more than mine five bucks ! 
picks up lint i thought this would be a good deal but the material for this set picks up dust and lint way too easily other wise it looks ok and didn t fade in the wash 
design flaw the first waffle came out ok but on our second try the lid mechanism locked with the waffle inside we tried everything to get the waffler open but had to send it back trapped waffle and all 
not a good purchase after ordering i was very disappointed ! i will be sending these back asap ! i can picture one of my small kids hurting themselves on the sharp corners ! do not buy this flatware 
broke first time using update just found out there is a year warranty they sent me a new one right away i ll give it one more try oldit lasted about minutes then registered high only i used it on in a grill cooking a filet did nothing special grill was not set at its highest temp this is the second one and the last one i try 
didn t work for long i received the shake ntake as a gift for christmas mine just broke down this morning the motor gave out i didn t really get weeks of service out of it 
usless if you read between the lines on the other reviews here i think you ll see that everyone thinks this thing is junk and their right no matter how small the job it won t do it it s just one more made in china piece of junk that i ve wasted money on it won t suck anything off hard wood or carpet floors i don t get how any company let alone a well known vacuum company could sell such a usless tool my only question is how could anyone give this thing two or more stars 
nice idea but disappointing i received this model as a gift and thought it would be great since we only brew a few cups at a time however as other reviewers noted almost immediately the clock started losing several minutes every day i wasn t intending to use the delay feature very often so i didn t bother to return it now just short of a year after i received it it suddenly started working so i m shopping for a replacement i might try another mr coffee model with better reviews but not this one 
too much type substandard product too high a price does not keep beverage warm for a long enough time construction is cheap and does not deserve the price 
disappointed i bought this merchandise as a christmas gift for my daughter after investigating all brands of slow cookers my daughter was pleased with the gift and had all of her ingredients ready to try it unfortunately the slow cooker was defective and did not work this purchase was through amazon via target she tried to return to target and was informed they couldn t do an exchange she would have to mail to amazon she did return back to amazon and weeks after christmas we still have no resolution needless to say we are not happy with the merchandise or the service provided 
do not buy my mother inlaw bought this popper for my two small children for valentine s day what a piece of junk ! my kids were so excited about it since popcorn is their favorite snack half a jar of orville redenbacher s kernels and minutes later it managed to pop enough to fill sandwich sized zip lock bags i d also like to warn you that it spits out hot unpopped kernels my year old picked one up before i could get to it and burned her finger i wish i could throw this thing away since it takes up so much space to store but i m sure my mother inlaw will look for it on her next visit 
non functional first and most importantly the server doesn t keep the coffee hot it does not have a glass thermal lining i should have known to look for that feature before i purchased this product after a half hour in the server the coffee is lukewarm and i have to reheat it in the microwave secondly the screw on top has some features that seem to serve no purpose a button on top that i assume is intended to release the vacuum so the coffee can be poured out it doesn t work you have to loosen the lid itself also the lid comes apart into several pieces for cleaning i guess but it collects coffee inside the hollow lid and then that coffee dribbles all over the place 
go with a different brand no lid rather spend the money on a brand that thinks before selling of a replacement piece 
enjoy it while it lasts i bought this heater at lowe s after returning another delonghi model to amazon it s great for a bedroom because it is practically silent the heat is effective and it did what it was supposed to do allow me to turn down the heat in the rest of the house at night while keeping the bedroom pleasantly warm that was the good news the bad news is that after a few months it broke down it turns off when you increase the heat by turning the thermostat up as another reviewer said it is now an attractive retro paperweight but that s about it i was considering having it fixed but after reading the parts hassle that others are having i m not going to bother after battling with delonghi over other retro products i m giving up i won t buy any of their stuff anymore by the way if you want a great silent heater try the bionaire micathermic model bnrbhu it doesn t have the snazzy styling of the delonghi but it works great and still runs afer a year 
buyer beware when i purchased this item there were dishes shown on the picture i ordered a quanity of however when i received the items i received only dishes not the total of that i expected 
size doesn t match product description when i got this table i was shocked to see that the table measured inches wide by inches deep the product description says that it is only inches deep that was the size i wanted not a square too bad they did not put a more accurate size in the description now i m stuck with a table that is too wide buy beware ! 
disappointing we have been searching for a solution to our very uncomfortable seats in our ford windstar van this cushion did not help 
just doesn t work ordered this at my wife s request she s tried cleaning silver earrings run multiple cycles added detergent as suggested it just doesn t clean an old toothbrush and toothpaste works much better a very disappointing piece of junk 
burned out i ordered this item fully understanding that it was a beginner s sewing machine i know it s not the heavy duty kind with bells and whistles that costs a pretty penny so when i tested the machine on the test material that comes with it i wasn t expecting it to be the only stitches i would get out the machine when i lifted the foot and took the sample material out and placed my material in cotton not a heavy material it didn t work i checked the plug nothing it simply stopped working i sent it back in about a month ago and just got it back today it works now but not a highly recommended product 
didn t receive item i didn t get this order did you credit my credit card if so email me with the conf number and when the credit was given 
doesn t fit i d give it zero stars if i could i read the review from and hoped that was just one bad batch but it isn t the lid is slightly too large and if used on a non stick pan will damage the non stick surface since it sits on that instead of the lip of the pan so i have returned it note that this is just a problem with the inch lid i also bought the inch lid and that one fits perfectly 
before buying this read this i really should ve done some research before buying this all of the reviews are correct there is considerable mold growing under the water dispenser area despite diligent washing x per week god knows this water isn t healthy in addition water leaks under the main water dispenser area so this is a huge negativelastly there are areas where the water doesn t drain
