so simple it s ridiculous i have owned several different espresso makers from krups to capresso to nespresso i have also had a capresso frother which i had to return because it didn t work while i have enjoyed the coffee i have always been frothingly challenged except on the lower end krups a fact i find mildly interesting anyway this aeroccino is so simple as to make you wonder and the froth is perfect as is the steamed milk so far i have not run into the problems of it shorting out and neither has a friend who has also purchased one but i am glad to know they will replace it the greatest thing since sliced bread for the consumer who likes gadgets and is willing to pay for the 
waterproof pad i m sure this waterproof pad would be exceptional for most instances it just couldn t handle the demands placed on it by our thirteen year old son thank goodness for hospital mattresses that said it should be fine for most other applications it just wasn t made to handle the abuses this child can put things through 
fuctional and easy to use i bought this item over a year ago and i use it almost everyday to make sugar free sodas it has never failed and is quite easy to use i am planning on buying another one soon just so that i can have a different color 
so much fun my dog a heeler sheltie mix loves this ball while living in my apartment she would herd it around the place but beware when it caught under a table she d bark at it for a while and when it didn t come out she d bark at me to get it ! when i took my dog to my dad s out in the country she herded the ball all over the yard she loved getting it going down the hills going on each side of it to keep it in line it s definitely one of her favorite toys

you can t screw up coffee with this one i received this as a gift from my sister first off you must know that both my sister and i are coffee snobs meaning we really enjoy the taste of a good quality coffee every previous coffee pot i have owned never made a good cup of coffee and if it did i don t know what formula was used to make it i tried every which way adjusting bean amount grind etc to no avail coffee always had a bitter taste the first pot i brewed in this one was absolutely perfect and so was every one after that ! excellent taste and quality i also found out that i can actually use a lot less coffee with this machine and still get the strong full bodied starbucks flavor that i like for those who complained about the temperature of the coffee i have to agree to some extent on cold mornings i must prime the coffeepot in order to produce a hot coffee that is only because of the hot coffee entering into a freezing cold metal pot ! it has nothing to do with the brewing process or temperature i also noticed someone actually commented that the heating element is barely warm to the touch that is because there is no heating element the stainless pot is what retains the heat in the coffee just make sure to prime your pot if you like it hot all in all this is a fantastic machine that brews a high quality cup of coffee 
stylish yet useful we bought this kennel for our shih tzu puppy and she just loves it the floor mat is soft yet easy to clean and the multiple zippered mesh openings allow us to access her from several sides or roll up the mesh so she can get in and out on her own it comes with handy zippered pockets for toys or treats and one large pocket detaches from the kennel to form a bag with a detachable leash great for travel the kennel is lightweight so it s easy to move around although we don t fold it up frequently it was a bit harder to unfold and open up than we expected but once it was open it was very sturdy for a small dog larger or more aggressive dogs might chew through the canvas material so you d want to be careful in matching this choice to the temperament of your pet i d rate this a if it weren t for that concern 
great humidifier read directions i have purchased my fair share of humidifiers and this is by far the best yet ! other reviewers have mentioned the filter indicator is always on but if you read the directions it states the humidifier has to be running for an hour before it can give you an accurate reading i also have a table humidifier from the same company the best ! let s face it humidifiers are not perfect but they keep me from getting sinus infections throughout the winter i highly reccommend this item ! 
count sateen excellent they are what they are i am very pleased with them how do you write up sheets i am a guy twice a year they get washed ha h 
excellent buy especially from uncle joe s my husband s family cans every year but we have never done it so this year i am heading down to a pickyourown farm with my husband and daughters in search of some good old fashioned family fun ! this kit was exactly what i needed not only comes with everything except a few extra jars and the fruit but also gives me a variety of recipes to try ! we used the coupons right away at walmart to get the other few items we needed also this item was shipped and arrived so quickly i was shocked unfortunately it was damaged and i was afraid i couldn t get a replacement on time uncle joe s immediately shipped a new one their customer service is excellent second to none 
excellent edge some design flaws i baught my global chef s knife about years ago it has been of great use in the kitchen and remains one of my favorite knives on the market the molybdenum vanadium steel of the global knives holds an edge far longer than its henkles wustolf counterparts my only complaint is the handle design which does not suit my gripping style nor my large hands i don t mind the steel handles although they do contribute to slippage and some loss of grip my main problem is with the tapered bolster which is almost a lack of bolster altogether coupled with the thin spine and heal of the knife extended use can be uncomfortable for the hand i highly recommend globals but i might suggest the heavyweight model which appears to have a more standard handle design and less tapering to the bolster for more info on knife handling and care you might check out the cia s book titled the professional chef s knife kit and one last comment although all knife companies like to claim their knives are dishwasher safe please please don t put your knives in the dishwasher 
great pan but a little on the expensive side i love cooking in this pan i love cooking in cast iron utensils in general of which i have a few from lodge it looks great and cleans well i don t understand the high price however it s just enamel on cast iron sure the colors are attractive but then you don t get the special flavors you get from contact of the food with the iron as you do in the lodge utensils it s not some hi tech product and you cannor really justify the cost if this is expensive the rest of the colors at more are prohibitively costly i can t see myself getting any more of le creuset products unless i get them in some special deal as i did this one or received them as gift 
great value for great product i m extremely pleased with the spiegelau glass collection amazon prices make it an even better buy elegant but not over styled make these glases a great addition to any table thus far no negatives i m not the most gentle of folks and thus far these have proved very durable 
may deserve stars solid well made cool looking and i think works well wife doesn t like it because only a small amount of pepper per pump which is true but i don t think someone would expect large amounts per pump from this certainly good enough for peppering a meal versus cooking i m going to buy the salt mill to go with it four stars because of my wife s opinion and it is a bit pricey otherwise i d give it five 
knife man this was a great product at a great price it is definitely a conversation starter for guests the knives are excellent quality too this purchase was a steal 
good toaster we had been using a toaster oven which was very slow and which had tohave the cycle repeated to get well browned toast the t fal is much faster and toasts evenly we had tried another toaster but returned it because of uneven toasting the variable setting allows good flexibility in toasting different types of bread we are pleased with the speed and performance of the t fa 
batali quart italian enamel on cast iron essentials pot persimmon i really like this product great to cook to bake bread and even better to clean excellent price less than half of the other brands and very good quality highly reccomended 
nice in many ways i bought this for my wife and i to use a few months ago we were looking for something to cook in that was between the qt and qt size at first i just wanted a new pot then when i saw this i took a chance and i m glad i did ! we use this almost every day i have slow cooked meats in it cooked pasta casseroles and soups along with dozens of other items i don t often deep fry but the few times that i have i have enjoyed this cooker i especially like the extra room it offers over most dedicated fryers i can cook enough for all five kids and still only have one easy pot to clean ! what more do you want 
satisfied just what we were looking for and a little more we only wish that the potwas slightly larger our recipes that used to fit comfortably in our old cookernow fill the new pot a little much and we get some spillage if we stir tovigorously or without care perhaps this is due to the shape oval as aginsta round shape 
now i can load my dehydrater with more stuff each time i use it i couldn t find these trays anywhere locally and i was very pleased to find them online i may be back to order more 
inexpensive lighting pros inexpensive at look like they cost morelights the room wellcons cheaply made but only apparent if physically handled for they re a bargain but i wouldn t pay much mor 
a god send great shape for the freezer or fridge our food has kept so well that there is little wastage good for marinator or just as a food saver canister the whole concept is such a friendly product to the earth recycleable and reduces food waste i wish everyone would get at least one of the food saver products 
handy dandy tote holds champagne bottles too stores flat nice workmanship great for trips xlt value 
versatile why haven t they come up with this before i love this little machine i have used this both on the stove top following all directions of course and in the base i have yet to use it in the oven but so far it is doing what the company claims it will do and that is versatility it cooks well and i think it s about time that slow cooker companies make their stoneware like this one kudos to rival ! the only knock is that the lid does not fit very flush against the edges but it is also stoneware and just as versatile so if that is the only knock against it bring it on ! 
very classy i purchased the wine cooler and ice bucket as gifts for my mother inlaw i was surprised by how light in weight they were which was a good thing for my mother inlaw they certainly are lenox quality and the price on amazon was outlet store pricing the only draw back is that there is not a set of tongs for the ice bucket and choosing a set of tongs turned out to be time consuming i recommend the onieda silicone tipped ones they were very classy and actually worked better than regular tongs the only somewhat drawback is the color choices offered for the tongs 
super price for a super pot calphalon is always one of my favorite cooking pots this pot is great for chili but any stew or just cooking pasta or pierogies great siz 
the best vacuum i have ever owned even though i vacuumed my carpeting with my old vacuum on a regular basis my carpets were still filthy i just never realized it when i first got my eureka bvz the dirt cup was filled with cat hair and other debris in no time ! someone else said they could make another cat out of the cat hair their vacuum picked up with all the cat fur from my three kitties my vacuum picked up i could make a whole family of cats and have enough left over to knit a sweater if i could knit that is my furniture carpeting and rugs look so much nicer i have asthma and find that i am actually able to breathe better and not use my emergancy inhaler nearly as often as i had been the power paw works very well on my furniture and throw pillows the money i spent on this vacuum will certainly be made up by not having to buy sweeper bags all the time maybe i am a bit warped but i enjoy seeing how much the vacuum has picked up when i remove the dust cup to empty it i get a real sense of accomplishment because i m disabled i was concerned that this vacuum might be difficult to handle and am pleased to say it is easier for me to operate than my old vacuum this is the best vacuum i ve ever owned i was so pleased with this vacuum after first using it i left it out to show off to all my friends when they came to visit i have never before in all my years been excited about a vacuum cleaner let alone enjoy using one believe it or not i am actually happy my old vacuum cleaner stopped working and i had to buy a new one and the eureka bvz was the one i chose 
excellent product the only drawback is that the directions don t make it clear that the shelf supports need to go on the uprights with the slanted edge up 
chef s choice m knife sharpener this item was rated tops by cooks illustrated my year old henckel knives are now the way there were the first day i bought them and the edges hold use after use they are razor sharp i love the result 
nice blanket i like this banket both its look feel i haven t washed it yet but since it s nicely oversized a bit of shrinkage shouldn t be a problem 
spirited stemware if you enjoy grappa or marc dry liqueur made from the lees of wine it s important to serve it in a tall narrow mouthed glass this type of glass traps the subtle aroma of grapes that makes drinking grappa an interesting experience if you drink kirschwasser or other eau de vie the same glass is used these work far better than brandy snifters which aren t really so suited to this type of delicate but potent liqueur 
works as advertised works good and has a long loud ring if you turn it to and then back to the time you want 
extremely pretty just the thing for dessert souffles if you make dessert souffles chocolate or jam filled these small heart shaped ramekins are just the thing to dress up your table they also hold cheese dips or other small side dishes the colors are very modern and interesting if you know someone who has used deep brown and kiwi or aqua in their decor this would make quite a housewarming gift or valentine s day present 
excellent buy i was skeptical to buy this product because of the bad review i saw on it however i was never one to trust the views of other people as my own so i purchased it needless to say i am very happy with it i have a black stove and it sits perfect on it it is very sheek looking and the inside is much larger than i thought it would be it was really a good buy ! i would definitely recommend it 
buy a bigger size i really love these sheets after i bought the sheets i read other peoples reviews because i was new to amazon and didnt realize there were reviews so i was worried when they were on there way to me that they wouldnt fit so i recieved them and put them on my bed and they were huge so i felt a little better about them not fitting i washed them and dried them and went to put them on my bed and it was a tight fit but it fit and i was very pleased but then i realized that i bought a cal king and i have a regular king so my suggeston would be if you want these sheets buy a bigger size but as to the sheets they are not soft but not hard my husband and i love them and we want to buy more one more suggestion if you buy them is to line dry them i did that the second time i washed just to make sure they wouldnt shrink anymore 
perfect toast what more could you ask for this toaster is everything i was hoping for it was well priced for a dualit product looks great in my kitchen and makes perfect toast every time in a timely manner 
awesome knife set i purchased this set for my husband who is a chef he raves about these knifes i am happy i made this purchase 
easy touse delicious results the villaware v ns prego pizelle baker makes two inch cookies at one time it comes with a booklet containing easy tomake recipes the results are wonderful you can roll the pizelles when they first come off the baker to make cannoli shells it says not to use metal utensils so i just used a toothpick to pry them off the baker it was very easy to do they keep well in an air tight container but don t really last long since they are so delicious i put a hard chocolate icing on some of the pizelles the baker is easy to clean high recommendation ! 
so worth the money i was in a car accident and have trouble gripping and also have pain and limited motion in my shoulders so even using the wing style cork screws were uncomfortable for me i finally decided to splurge on an easy touse corkscrew i m so glad i bought this one you just place the corkscrew on the bottle then turn the handle clockwise it s big and rubber and easy to turn grip the corkscrew goes down into the bottle and actually lifts the cork out as you continue to turn it clockwise then to get the cork off of the corkscrew you just turn the handle counter clockwiseim so glad i splurged and quit struggling with cheap corkscrews you do still need the use of both of your hands one to squeeze the corkscrew against the bottle and the other to turn the handle but it did not require much strength at all its also attractive and comes in a sturdy plastic box which is nice as it won t get scratched up in my messy kitchen utensil drawer 
great gift these sheets were a gift for my year old mother who had never owned flannel sheets she loves them ! my mother told me theyre soft warm and wonderful money well spent 
great led nightlight cheap to run and last forever this is the only two led light i can find it s a little larger in size than it has to be but it puts off more light than the single led version uses a maximum of watt of electricity the frosted cover is nicer than the clear version hi lo switch slightly controls light output led s are slightly blue in color 
great collar this collar works out great it performs just as the amazon description shows it is unintrusive and snaps off when certain force is exerted it s fun too because of the colors and affordable 
great wall pot rack i bought this pot rack because i live in a small apartment and needed to find a way to maximize the space it looks great in my kitchen and keeps all of my pots out of the cupboards within easy reach on the wall it comes with many hooks and looks stylish i was considering making a pot rack but by the time you buy the hooks and what not this rack would end up being a better value 
pleasant surprise this is a lovely product i would buy another one and also recommend it to my friends 
suprised a neat bowl i debated on buying these for weeks was not sure what they would look like i very please when they arrived neat bowls they look like cerel bowls handels on the side i done puddings and oin soup so far graet clean up and i like the look a step up from a cerel bowl 
now i can cook like the pros feel just like giada and dip out that pasta it is a great product with a super long handle for large pots i love it i gave one as a gift too 
easy fun delish the smell of the roasting coffee is just the beginning of the great experience with this roaster easy to use and a snap to clean i use a digital scale to measure the quantity going in the volume measurements varies according to the beans so do it by weight bravi instructions are mg no more no less the smoke during roasting is part of the process putting the roaster under my kitchen hood handles that the most fun is having guests watch it happen most have never seen heard yes you hear the bean cracking coffee roasting a conversation starter for sure ! during the automatic cool down the kitchen smells wonderful the aromas seem to improve during cool down then get ready for a great coffee experience i set my digital roast level to and get the right color for my taste when grinding i only grind enough for immediate use also for some reason the grounds of my home roasted beans seem to fluff up about so i have to cut down the quantity of ground coffee i brew usually i use tbs per cup so the grounds don t expand beyond the filter i use a drip machine the dark rich brew and fresh taste from home roasting is unlike any other experience i ve had with coffee to help make sure your bravi is ready to roast you need to be sure you have cleaned up any beans and chaff from previous roastings clean the chaff collection pull out dish to avoid smoke from burning also brush off the surface under the bean collector bin if a bean is left under the bin the bravi may not sense it is closed and ready and not start great experience and i recommend the bravi to anyone 
very good grinder this is a excellent coffee grinder the only thing i would want different is one that adjusts to fine med course grounds you can mostly figure how long to run it to adjust the texture of the ground you want also very nice modern looking design 
almost a home run wedgey certainly is cute however keep in mind to only use this on eggs or other very soft food items it is a little hard to line the wires up appropriately for the price this is a good piece of equipment and a whimsical addition to any kitchen 
fabulous little hot water pot we love this pot and keep hot water available hours nice to grab that lunchtime soup or late night cup of camomile tea it is easy to use pour in water plug in and pour push down on circle which depresses on top of lid great value ! this was a surprise appliance in the best possible way never expeccted to like it so much or use it so constantly on the kitchen counter good looking too ! jil 
coffee lover greetings i love this stove top espresso maker but there are some differences you may find of value the boiler where you put the water can only be filled about compared to most at which means a rather large unit in relation to the amount of espresso you can make maintenance is more than others because this machine uses more pressure and there are more seals to replace when necessary these are not readily available locally and you will probably have to have them shipped to you at an extra expense that may exceed your sense of reasonableness also most of these types of machines come with extra seals this unit doesn t come with any extra seals at all the picture looking through the window at the top of the machine seeing the nice crema is a farce the only way to see the nice crema if you carefully follow the directions is to lift the lid up and wipe the condensation off of the inside that is always present that blocks your view realize that this unit is made of aluminum and some are concerned with the toxic effects of that if any gets into your java that has high acidity content plusus include very nice and tasty espresso superior to other stove top machines no aluminum taste really nice crema but only if yor coffee is of a fine grind or and the coffee needs to be freshly ground if you buy pre ground coffee packages at the market you will not be seeing any crema i buy fresh coffee ground by the half pound at or fine grind and get really good results i hope this is helpful to you cheers 
still special coffee the old fashioned way is still the best there is something special in the handson approach to coffee makinga touch of the oriental tea ritual and with this generous size theres plenty for your friends too 
just what i was looking for i was looking for awhile for some nice solid flatware for everyday use and finally found it this is very solid does not bend i didn t want shiny because it usually dulls after awhile anyway we just love it i ordered sets 
the best grill on the market the grill is so capable that i sold our gas grill at a garage sale ! i purchased of these for myself in blue and one for my mother in red she was delighted i use one for beef fish poultry and the other at the same time for veggies etc it is exceptionally well made guaranteed for years and the weight of the grill reflects it s quality if you have weak wrists or if lifting anything heavy is a problem unfortunately this wouldn t be for you also it is more difficult to clean then any of my other le creuset pieces however no more trouble to clean then the rack from our gas grill in fact less so as it s smaller and fits into the sink more easily simply let it soak for a bit in warm water and it s no trouble i use mine at least times a week and am only sorry i didn t purchase it sooner i highly recommend it 
great set this set has worked out very well for my needs it is a nice collection the various sizes with lids is really nice they have held up well 
solid these bowls are nice perfect for soup dessert salad or whatever well i like big salads so they re a little small for my salads but they re great for a lot of things and i swear you could drop them on the floor and they probably wouldn t break they fit nicely on the small fiestaware plates so you don t spill a full bowl of soup they go in the fridge to store leftovers in the dishwasher ive washed these things hundreds of times and they re still in great shape and probably in the freezer too if only fiestaware would make tupperware like lids so i d feel more comfortable putting these in the freezer for storing things as they are i have to use plastic wrap which always lets in yucky freezer smells 
henckels inch stainless steel knief so far we are very happy with the knife and will probably order the larger version 
we eat times more rice now this is the rolls royce of rice cookers excitement is what you ll feel when you open this box anybody who intends to eat healthy would love this for gift ! big for families but cooks half a cup of rice for a single serving just as well too many benefits to this wonderful machine most of all easy to clean it s a little overpriced but once you get over that life becomes easier especially if you want to save money rice comes out perfect every time the timer on it lets you know precisely when it going to be done this is convenient to let you know when to start putting teriayaki strips on the grill or cooking chicken so they come off at the same time it fun to experiment with various settings i prefer the japanese rice soft setting keeps rice hot for days don t waste your time shopping all the asian stores they all cost the same there or more you know if you get yours from amazon it hasn t been sitting on a retail shelf of a year 
great item i looked all over for a cutting board like this i almost didn t buy it because of the negative review on this site but i really needed one so i went ahead with the purchase this is an awesome item ! it does stand up to heavy use you just need to bend the arms slightly to make them stay in place an added feature is that the bamboo is water repellent and very hard i would highly recommend this cutting board 
no kitty smell i love this thing ! i hate the smell of the litter box my teenage daughter has two cats princess and abby abby is the skittish one yet she was in the litter robot using it right away the daughter like most teenagers was very poor about cleaning the kitty litter box and the house usually smelled like kitty litter the smell in her room was so overpowering that i could not stand to go in there without holding my breath once we got the litter robot the smell went away and we are living happily ever after it worked perfectly right out of the box we have used it for several weeks now without any problems i am so pleased with this litter robot it works perfectly even when operated by a teenager 
shaken not stirred the lenox set is wonderful ! the finish and fit are excellent i would highly recommend this bar accessory as a must have 
great press and slicer i bought this same press from williams and sonoma i really love the slicer part of it had never seen that before great to have options with how fine course you want your garlic and the brush that attaches right into the handle makes for an easier cleanup it is a heavy weight and i think will be around for quite a while good product 
over all great looking lamp lamp stem was thicker than i expected it has brush marks sort of looks like scrached but i believe it was done on purpose as style wife loves it i like how it s way watts 
great buy does the job and a good buy not a real decorator item though 
wonderful baking dish a high quality creuset product ! i love it i ve made great dishes with it and its easy to clean with no discoloration deterioration after mutliple uses but be warned creuset products are on the heavy side i do not consider this a drawback this is a sign of quality and durability but if you have never owned a creuset product it is something to be aware of 
great buy love the way the mattress pad works no leaks but even better it s comfortable and quiet no crinkly sounds like a vinyl cover very comfy and unnoticable ! only reason i gave it a and not a was washing when removed from the washer it s very heavy i was afraid to dry it although it did dry fine so no concerns there either 
yeah it s not a slipcover which is why the title says throw it s the thing you buy to put on new furniture so when company comes you can rip it off quick and stuff it in the ottoman cumtable with the fliptop lid its just meant to keep the nice stuff nice longer you could do that though with an old bedspread but this thing is nice i got the gold a very pretty soft color and it makes my brand new sofa look wonderful while i m trying to keep it looking wonderful longer in a house full of kids and animals not including my husband so now that we re clear it is not a slipcover hopefully folks will recognize this for what it is and buy it for that purpose just make sure you ve got a place to stash it quick when company comes you ll look like you re the world s greatest housekeeper or at the very least your guests won t leave with a pet hair coat on the seat of their pants 
very good processor i use this to slice any fresh fruits and vegetables i don t cut up the food with a knife any more this is great it s fast so it saves a lot of time it s easy to clean and take apart was well worth the money other processors cost much more than this one this one does the job very well 
handy little product i really like this product ! it s small size makes it very portable and the display is easy to operate works well with bowls but a little tougher to use with plates unless you raise the plate slightly with some sort of stand and adjust for the additional weight thank heavens for the hold feature 
knife expert approved multi functional and durable i am a stage performer as well as a chef i specialize in contortion and throwing knives often with my feet i use the wusthof so much in the kitchen that i thought i would incorporate it into my act i throw the knives at flying fruit and vegis and perform flips with knives between my toes and fling them at my assistants throwing knives are usually smaller perfectly balanced and forged from one solid piece they require perfect tang as well and incredible strength wusthof is the only high end kitchen knife that meets these requirements although i have several chef s knives global henckel wusthof etc i prefer the wusthof both in the kitchen and on stage i would never bring the henckel or any other brand wusthof has absolutely perfect balance and tang the difference from throwing knives is that kitchen knives usually have handles added to the forged steel unlike any other high end brand wusthof s handle is extremely durable in practice i broke all other brands of knife both handle and blade i was surprised that my henckels did not last very long the star pro s blade snapped in half and s handle came apart on one side the quality of a wusthof really shows when you use it for something it s not meant for and is still extremely reliable and as you can read in all the other reviews it is very sharp in case you re wondering i ve never injured an assistant but i did slit my foot open one time i also stuck a head of lettuce to a vaulted ceiling 
love revere all the bad reviews on the revere pots and pans are totally off base the newer revere pots and pans are not excactly like the ones made years ago in clinton illinois but this cookware is wonderful i love the light weight it making cooking easier also the taste of the food using these pot and pans is worth the puchase i am so impressed with my set that i bought on amazon and the amazon price was great i ve used froo froo pots and pans heavy in weight and they did not cook my food as well as the revere ! 
windowbox gardenia sent to my daughter in ca for her birthday she loves the gardenia the service was excellent thanks to frances emily and my an

great i have house cats and i only kept one of these in the house to watch of the cats climb on top of each other to get in this thing is hilarious and all the cats that cant fit into it they have to sleep next to it 
nice quality cotton sheets my wife and i find these cotton sheets to be very comfortable the higher thread count makes them nice a thick 
cutting board i love it and it performs as advertised 
great cookie sheets i have lived in europe recently and was unable to use my jelly roll pans and cookie sheets because of the standard size of the ovens there i purchased these because they would easily fit their ovens i used them at christmas and was thrilled at how the cookies came out i have never used a cookie sheet that cooked such as to have the cookies literally sliding off the cookie sheet without any nudge if you have a gas oven i would suggest watching the first batch to see the actual time you need in i accidentally browned the bottom a little too much the first batch they are more weighty than my other cookie sheets but that is their only draw back a true find for the frequent baker 
i love this bowl i love this serving bowl i used it to store my various fruit when i was single now spending my first holiday with my new husband i am using it for casseroles meat dishes and all sorts of uses ! i highly recommend it and would buy more if my budget allowed 
great oversized towels for the price these bath sheets are great ! very soft and plush exactly what i was expecting 
design vs function this style of this slow cooker is its attraction however after only three months s usage and i use it at least once a week it was such a disappointment when one of the handles broke off i immediately began searching for a replacement for the pot and it seems there is none anywhere take care with those handles 
riedel the only true serious choice of glassware i first tried this riedel single malt glass a year ago and have not used anything else since this glass is perfect for appreciating the flavours of a single malt whether you prefer single malts from the highlands lowlands or islays my personal favourite region you will be able to explore the multitude of tastes both subtle and otherwise i got this glass and first tried some laphroaig year single islay malt and i honestly thought i could taste the sea breeze and the seagulls the experience almost transported me to the isle of islay out of quite breathtaking highly recommended 
marvelous steamer ! i ordered this item when my american tourister steamer also made by franzus began leaking after more than years of faithful service both on the road and here at home i had been looking for several weeks since i m pretty picky about my appliances this steamer has exceeded my expectations in every category it must have been designed by someone who actually uses the product it is efficient well designed easy to use and very compact the cord is ft long making it usable even in those rare large hotel bathrooms where the outlet is far from the shower bar the butterfly handle design is easier to use than other steamers on the market affording level grip even to a jet lagged traveller the handles fold well flat against the body of the steamer comes with a brush head that i haven t tried yet forgot to put it on the steamer while it was cool and a drawstring bag for easy storage packing i am thrilled with this steamer it s even better than the older version that i loved obviously the company has paid attention to detail continued to improve their product i was so happy to find this is made by franzus since i already know their high quality based on the long life on my last franzus made steamer the micro pro also steamed clothing wrinkle free in less time than my old model great for at home use too if you re like me and hate to iron saves your fabric while making clothes look fresh from the cleaners or the dryer i rate this franzus micro pro steamer a for its compact good looks clever features and easy usability franzus thought of everything if you ve been shopping for a steamer look no further ! 
cooks illustrated loved it i just put in an order for one based on cooks illustrated ranking this the blender i hope i have a better experience than that other reviewer who gave hers star 
vornado vortex heat i just had to post after reading the reviews i have had a vornado vortex heater since i paid twice what this one costs and it has been excellent whisper quiet just like the vornado fans it has moved with us been used up and downstairs been dropped and mistreated it was recalled and rebuilt in december of and i would definately buy another 
my cat loves these my cat loves these as soon as i opened the package my cat came running and started to play he usually gets bored with the toys i buy fairly quickly but he still loves these months later the price was good too in the local stores it s costs this much for just mice not all around a good deal for the money 
great value these towels are generously sized thick and luxurious probably worth much more than the cost here on amazon 
good for its price i was initially going to purchase the eureka b quick up vacuum not cordless because my boyfriend had the exact same thing but then i found this cordless model and decided to give it a try i have now been using it for months without a problem good battery life i can vacuum the living room dining room and bedrooms before recharging no cord no hassle ! easy to clean filter and dirt cup obviously this light weight vacuum cannot replace my bigger vacuum but it s convenient and easy to use for quick clean ups really good for its price 
great shakers the stove top salt and pepper shakers are exactly what i wanted i am using them to cook with they are big enough to hold a lot and so convenient i was tired of having to open the cabinet and look for the big salt and pepper boxes they look so nice in my kitchen the plastic covers are a bonus i haven t used the plastic covers yet but have them put away in a cabinet in case i need them for storage reasons smart move by the makers of these i am pleased and highly recommend these salt and pepper shakers to others 
nice lamp but where s the white shade a very nice looking lamp for the money easy assembly but no crisp white shade as promised it is definitely a beige shade with a rough fiber look and texture you have to pull the shade open like the old fashioned collapsable tophats ! they look real cozy though and are more substantial looking than they appear in photo a good value i am quite pleased 
great ice shaver what a great buy we made with this now we can make our own ice cones frappe lemonade and everything for the hot summer 
old way still the best some may wonder why bother when seltzer water comes in bottles makes excellent high quality carbonated water for a true diet soda without chemicals or add it to cocktails it s fun and easy to make just screw in the chargers and shake great design a conversation piece nostalgic and retro just like the bars in the old movies economical less than cents per soda charger for one liter great gift idea drawbacks the co soda charges can be tough to find amazon had them then they didn t they may again buy in bulk the one liter dispenses quickl 
nice product the lamp looks nice but it is smaller than what it appears in the picture 
great cork screw this is the best foil cutter i have used and i have tried a lot of them the cork screw works with the ease of my raabbit with out the bulkiness great buy 
a really good canister i love fiestaware and these canisters go perfectly in my kitchen i like that they are large enough to get a decent amount of flour and sugar in them the seal seems really airtight but i did accidently splash some water on the top of them and the water did get into the canister they are easy to clean and look very classic 
what a fun gadget i bought this pepper grinder because i love oxo products and i also have carpel tunnel and arthritis in my hands i don t really care for pepper but when i buy it i buy a combination of coarse pepper and sea salt i love the little window that you open to fill it as well as being able to see how much is in there i also like the cap on the bottom so it keeps it clean sitting on my stovetop but most of all i like the knob to grind the spice i have mine set on fine grind but it is adjustable i think you could use it for any spice you want to grind not just pepper it is fun and easy to use and looks nice sitting on my stove i love this gadget ! 
excellent product for what it s intended to do sadly i bought this item from a link in google that took me to amazon and didn t list all the sources on amazon that sold it i ended up paying or so more than necessary for it since their price was more than target s shipped price i bought it at beach audio through amazon for with a shipping charge of for a final price of had i realized i should have re searched on amazon for the brand and model number i would have found it from target at the listed price and shipping under a substantial savings however sad as i am that i could have saved a few of my social security bucks i m totally amazed at the job this tiny fan is doing for me here s my situation and though i m sure yours is quite different you can see the value of the appliance im a retired person living upstairs in a tiny living quarters with someone else living downstairs who is in control of the heating and cooling of the house during the fall and spring when it s nice outside the house heat is turned on and migrates upward to become trapped in my tiny living quarters if i open a window the heat goes out and the heating system comes back on to make more i m sure this causes their electric bill to skyrocket i found that if i become uncomfortable i can close my door and my air conditioning vent and crack a window for fresh air allowing the heat transmitted through the floor to warm the room this works pretty well but sometimes not much air comes in the window and occasional birds and insects to find their way in the little honeywell fit one of my windows perfectly and can be set to quietly blow air in and out at the same time and it s thermostatically controlled so it can hold the room at exactly the temperature i like if i want to smoke a cigar or my pipe i can set it to exhaust through both fans or to circulate in and out faster so i don t have to worry about poluting the air throughout the house be sure the door and a c vent are closed before doing this they will notice the fan blades are plastic but well enough made so the low setting is not objectionable at all i had tried a box fan to exhaust air before but that was extremely noisy even at the lowest setting the low setting on this one makes no more noise than my computer fan and still moves air so well i immediately feel the fresh air i paid too much for it but it s worth twice the price to me i m a happy old man and very pleased with my purchase i hope it lasts a long time 
great cooking tool this is a sturdy spoon that can be used for all types of cooking tasks without the concern of breaking i use this item almost every day for one cooking task or another easy to clean and maintain 
feliway diffuser great product we have a household of indoor cats this product is very effective at minimizing the aggression that is bound to happen in this situation it was amazing from the very first day we now keep two units in the house and it is quite obvious if we forget and one of them runs out i have heard similar stories from friends who use this product even one friend who works with feral cats i highly recommend this product for anyone with a multiple cat household 
good sheets for the price i have read all the reviews on this product and some people pick and complain about these sheets they are thread count for a super cheap price i think i paid like for these babies and they are good for the money put them in the spare bedroom on the bed that gets used by your inlaws or infrequent comapny and they are just wonderful 
seems a bit flimzy this item is acually rated for total pounds but it seems a little flimzy to me i already had one shelving unit that i bought from a local store that is much beefier but was not much more expensive i loaded this unit up with items in my garage and it is holding but i don t fully trust it the side supports are a little too thin and it is just a bit wobbly i am going to anchor it to the wall but i really shouldn t have to do that also the edges are very sharp i would recommend wearing gloves while assembling the instruction sheet did warn of this but really how many people actually read the instructions 
easy does it the loren set was assembled except for the table and securely packed good workmanship i recommend the set 
great chair this chair is very comfotable and attractive i m happy with it the price is awsome 
convenient inexpensive i love this hamper even when it is full of laundry it does not tip over the handles make it easy for me to carry downstairs to the laundry room it callapses if i don t need it and stores easily it s inexpensive and has free shipping plus it doesn t take up lots of space and vents so wet towels don t mold other clothes in the hamper it s perfect for anyone who doesn t want to spend a fortune on a hamper 
useful tool for bakers this is a well made product that makes life much easier for bakers it is perfect for chopping bulk chocolate and minimizes the time it would take if you were chopping chocolate with a knife it is very sturdy and well built 
great filters the filters are replacement parts for those that came with the deep fryer when newly purchased they work as advertised 
great product i was surprised by what poor reviews most of the crock pots received on amazon com but i decided to buy this little one when i saw it at target for figured even if it didn t work well that s not much money to lose ! well this is my first crock pot and i love it i m glad there s one this small i usually fill it only half way and then have leftovers but it could probably feed a family of four without leftovers a lot of reviews for other crock pots said that the lids often fit poorly but the lid on mine is perfect i ve used it seven times so far and everything has been wonderful ! i particularly like the applesauce recipe that comes with the crock pot it makes the best applesauce ever and it s nice to just peel them the night before and wake up to hot applesauce also good over ice cream keep in mind that the crock pot only has the low heat setting but i haven t had any trouble cooking recipes that call for the high setting in here just takes a bit longer also it s not tough at all to convert recipes for larger crocks to fit this one mine doesn t have any problem with cooking to hot maybe it was just the other reviewer s crock pot i would recommend this to anyone it s well worth the money 
wouldn t give it up for the world i ve had my kitchenaid pro series for about years or so now and use it at least once a week in culinary school i developed a bad habit of walking off to do some other project and forgetting about the machine or putting too much in at once the pro series motor handles it all it s really a kitchen workhorse whether your kitchen is a home or a professional one

nothing more solid than a bunn i ve seen other bunn brewers run years under constant use and never wink out if you are looking for a constant use brewer especially for an office setting this is it don t skimp on a cheap plastic braun krups or mr coffee this is an investment that will take the abuse of multiple office patrons 
very nice table i am very pleased with the look of this table it makes a great addition to my entry way as a place to stash mail purse keys etc even my furniture snobrealwoodonly husband was impressed easy to put together with all the parts clearly labled it only took me about minutes to assemble using a phillips head screwdriver i also bought the mission style wall rack to hang above the table the two pieces look very nice together i certainly will be buying more items in this collection 
good replacement parts i have had the krups crystal arome for almost years now and the original carafe just broke this replacement fits the coffee maker just fine but the white color is a little off from the original one they did make some improvements to the lid design which is more sturdy than the original overall i am very pleased with this item 
the best cervical roll for me at least as a physical therapist who suffers from neck pain this is the only pillow that i can use without waking up to having cervical muscle spasms in the mornings this pillow is great for people who do not have the normal curvature of the cervical spine a ka straight necks cervical arthritis etc i bought one years ago at cvs have been looking for a year now for a replacement since mine cannot support my neck very well anymore it has been a week that i have been waking up to neck spasms i am delighted to find that it is here at amazon it was here all along i just have been typing in the wrong name cervical pillow cervical roll neck roll etc i am happy that i remembered what my year old son called it bone typed it and boy was he right

excellent bacon press this litle pig has it all right size well constructed fun to own and does the job right

love it i used to have a cuisinart and i gave it to goodwill after buying this mandolin yeah the cuisinart was great and it can do some things this can t like making pesto but you know i make pesto twice a year i can use my mortar and pestle on the other hand slicing things and making julienne strips is something both these do effortlessly but i never used to take the cuisinart out to do it because the cleanup was such a hassle with this its washed and dried in seconds i find that i actually use this instead of just owning it for quotsomedayquot the only caution i have is that blade is sharp so always use the guard 
phorm light i like it i ve had the phorm light for a month and i enjoy it it lights up the whole room its compact so i can store it away when i m not using it it s much better than using an overhead light i just really like this product and i ll go even further to say that this is the best product that i ve bought so far this year and i ll constantly wonder what took me so long to order it instead of struggling to get some light for reading out of tap lights 
floor cleaning the bissell flip it saves me a lot of time cleaning floors and does a more thorough job than a mop 
very practical the dishes not only look good but are a good size the complete set is really nice not too dark so that other colours can also be used at the same time 
great little sweeper just read the reviews of the bissell b sweeper i ve had mine now for a year and a half and i think it does a great job true it is not a vacuum but it does do the in between job of picking up debris from carpets and hard surfaces with cats and a dog plus living in the woods we get a ton of pet hair and dirt twigs etc tracked into the house it helps to keep the house tidied up until we do a regular vacuuming 
swiss diamond cast aluminum nonstick inch fry pan wow ! what a terrific skillet ! i have stayed away from nonstick cookware for many years because in time the finish always starts to come away from the metal who knows then how much of that finish has gotten to your food this skillet comes with a limited lifetime warranty and it can be put in the dishwasher it is so easy to clean that i have not found the need to put it in the dishwasher i would definitely recommend this skillet to anyone 
i love this thing this is a great storage cabinet ! i looked around quite a bit before deciding on this one it was definately the cheapest of all i looked at and i think the best looking it s totally cute and very functional it s a cinch to put together comes with very clear instructions and no tools are needed when it s empty it isn t very heavy and can easily be moved the shelves are adjustable to different heights as well 
i love my wok this wok is so far the best one that i have ever had it is truly non stick easy to clean the glass domed lid is a really nice touch which gives the wok a very classy look i am addicted to cooking most of my meals in this wok from salmon fillets to one pot family meals i highly recommend this wok with no doubt bygbab 
very pretty and elegant looking i finally got iced tea spoons ! no more burned wet fingers from stirring tea with a short spoon these have a simple graceful design the shiny parts are very shiny and the satin finish parts are a matte silver a nice contrast i ve washed them in the dishwasher already and they are d w safe as advertised 
gravy strainer this is the best grease remover i have every used it is very easy to clean 
inexpensive air circulation excellent for fall spring here in florida fans have a reversible switch which is very handy dont have to turn the whole fan around 
best wine opener available this is by far the best wine opener i have ever used it is beautiful a work of art just to start with therefore it can be left out and does make a great conversation piece i have the clear winemaster it works wonderfully from the attached foil cutter to the heavy duty parts everything does what it is supposed to first you lock the opener onto the bottle this took me a few tries to understand but now that i understand the concept it is a piece of cake to do im not great with mechanical things then you manipulate the levers raiselower the long ones and the short ones each once and very easily not only does the cork come right out but it is easily released from the opener so that you can save it if you want to and it is not damaged it is well worth the price it also would make a great gift for someone special 
perfect this was just what i wanted and i received it very quickly thank yo 
great for teens we got of them and gave them to my teenage daughters friends and they loved them super gift for a teen girl 
bacon fast easy bacon has always been a family treat for breakfast on the weekends due to the time it takes to cook and clean up however with this bacon cooker we can have bacon any day of the week in just a few minutes with no mess ! the cooker works great but avoid trying to cook too much bacon at one time otherwise it will cook unevenly pieces as pictured on the box is too much i recommend only cooking pieces at a time one per row but try it for yourself 
high end quality at a great price i was pleasantly surprised to find this on amazon i had seen these in high end retailers for and more plus shipping on amazon it s even set up as prime as for the gate itself it s perfect we have a high lb cavalier king charles spaniel and the height is perfect for us it s high enough to keep her in and low enough to let us walk over it without a problem the wood matches our house a coincidence for us perhaps but it s nicely put together and the wood is very high end looking the freestanding part of it works very well it s very secure and solid

great gift this was a beautiful gift for my daughter who has beaucoup fiestaware much appreciated 
solid hardwood makes this a good buy i have bought of these bookcases they are very well made set up in minutes forget the pressed wood bookcases i have they sag and fall apart not these bookcases they are solid wood the real thing and best of all there is no assembly required just unfold where you want it and start filling it up ! also very easy to move in the house especially through narrow places because it can be folded up again excellent buy for the price not made in china i think it is made in vietnam 
very satisfied i love this tea pot i have been using it for about months now it is innovative and user friendly what s so great about this pot is the fact that the handle automatically opens the spout when you take it off the stove which makes it incredibly easy to pour your cup of tea without messing with levers and whatnot the handle never gets hot to the touch either which is important it has a nice whistle to it which starts out slow and builds to a full whistle when it s ready overall this exceeded my expectations and i am very satisfied 
a great coffeemaker because of its design this coffeemaker isn t subject to the kind of clogging that plagues most one cup coffeemakers the arrangement of drip holes in the cone is downright ingenious no buttons to push or levers to press and it turns itself off when it s finished i think it s terrific 
great pan i love this pan i did some research and what everyone said about the pan was right it is a real winner easy to use great to clean the seller was wonderful as well a good deal all around 
richell richell one touch adjustable pet gate with wood finish good gate and the wood finish looks well with house decor easy to use with one hand a little hard to install in doorway and the piece at the bottom can cause a tripping hazard would be better if the bottom rail was lower profile or if the bottom was wider and angled on both sides as a ramp so that you don t trip over it we have all hit our toes and tripped going through this door you will trip or hit your foot if you do not go slow and raise your feet 
handy these shakers hold a large amount of salt and pepper the plastic covers are great for keeping dust and moisture off of them the fact that you can take the wide lids off makes them easy to fill and easy to use when measuring for recipes i really like them 
open sesame this product is great i was so tired of using other types of can openers and i ve tried them all with the electric ones the cans would slip off and splash water all over the table the manual ones also slip off and then i d have to saw the rest of the lid off with a steak knife both types leave a very sharp lid i ve cut my fingers many times the onetouch solves all the problems associated with opening cans you just place the one touch on top of the can press the button and the one touch does the rest this can opener even leaves a lip on the top of the lid so you can close the can fantastic ! 
rachael rocks ! so do her knives these are my second set of rachael ray knives and i could nt be happier they are super sharp and they cut through everything really easily they make cutting so much fun 
very nice set for the price this is a very nice set of inexpensive flatware not overly weighty but still balance nicely in the hand made well no sharp or crooked edges to any of the utensils the piece serving set is very nice addition as mentioned before the extra pieces are actually teaspoons which is standard not salad forks 
exceptionally high quality perfect release i have used these for making florentine cookies which are extremely sticky having used disposable mini aluminum pans in the past they work perfectly releasing the florentines immediately just ordered two more pans and the price went down too 
excellent i love this rice cooker i never thought the rice would taste as good as mine but it did even my children approve i haven t used the other features yet but hope to soon 
media storage review this is the best all around media storage cabinet i have owned in over years of storing media it s outside design is great the shelving design inside is flexible so you may use it to hold cds dvds videos including those nonstandard sized special edition sets if you like it s durable i ve bought six of these and placed two in of the rooms in my house each of which have different furniture spacing availability and i ve found that these are the right overall size for all of my conditions 
brita on tap water filter i have been using the brita on tap water filter a few years i like it because it saves me from carrying bottled water it also lets you know when it has to be changed which is a plus i also use the filtered water for coffee tea and whatever use i have for recipes using water i have tried other brands and always go back to the brita i think it is a good investment 
it s ok it works as it should but it really does not hold alot and has to be refilled often if you use sugar as much as i do i tried it with splenda also and it did not work too good splenda is to lite and airy if you like alot of sugar it gets alittle old pushing the button so many times 
kitchenaid knives we purchased this as a gift for someone the price was right and ordering it on amazon was easy we had it shipped directly she seems to like them quite a bit 
great yogurt i recently bought an euro cuisine yogurt maker and resumed making my own yogurt there is no comparison homemade is much better starter matters i tried dannon plain yogurt as my starter it worked but the yogurt wasn t nearly as good the euro cuisine yogurt starter tastes much better and after the first batch it brews up in only three hours i think the bacteria are really lively which is probably a bonus for our gut too 
i love my mogu i love my mogu doll this is the third one that i have purchased i now have two and my sister inlaw who always wanted to steal mine now has her own 
don t buy these i am disgusted with the quality of this item ! i understand it is inexpensive but the sheets snagged after one usage and i wear satin pajamas there is nothing to snag on after one wash they were unusable the quality is horredous ! pay an extra and get something better 
great for daily use nott made for heavy duty cleaning i read the reviews before i purchased this machine i know from experience that reviews are extremely subjective and often times people misuse the appliance or simply expect more than a machine is capable of so with this in mind i will put in my cents i have had my machine for two months and i use it about times a week on a square foot vinyl kitchen floor that accomodates two adults a year old and two dogs generally it works pretty well and is much more convenient than a regular mop and bucket you must remember that this is a low cost residential machine and as such will not replace the suction and scrubbing power of a serious vacuum and elbow grease the machine is set up to auto shut off if you move the machine quickly or drop it down low i agree with with the other writers about the poor suction capability but you must consider the overall design of the machine a powerful adjustable head machine that would pick up more than dog hair and dust would be cost prohibitive i see what hoover was trying to do with this machine they were trying to accomodate our scrubbing and vacuuming needs in one cost effective machine they gave it a good shot but for all of us clean freaks this machine doesn t quite hit the mark the water cleaning solution section is in my humble opinion to small i run out of water quickly and i have a very small kitchen but the good news is that my kitchen is so small i can take three steps over to the sink and fill it up one more comment before i give my final review remember to follow the instructions and use only the kind of cleaners hoover recommends there s a reason for this if you use regular household cleaners that cut crease you will damage your machine and it will most certainly leak and die ! the grease cutting agents in regular household cleaners and soaps strip the bearings and fry the gaskets so my final opinion is this if you have a relatively small space and need a daily quick scrub it s a great time saver it s a good overall cleaner if you need a quick vac up of dog hair scrub and mop any more heavy duty than that and you are back to the good old vacuum attachment mop and bucket routine if you are a cleanfreak like me you know that nothing replaces a good old fashioned hand andknees scrub no machine will ever leave you satisfied this machine was definately not made for heavy duty cleaning but for light daily use it s great i am giving this machine stars because i think it does what it was designed to do light cleaning i would have given it stars if the cleaning solution bucket was larger and the cut off mechanism was a little more liberal and a little more suction power would have been nice when hoover finally comes up with a heavy duty scrubber with the suction power of a regular vacuum scrubbing power of my own elbow and ability to get into corners and baseboards i ll be all over it ! until then i ll settle for a daily scrub with this machine and a good hand scrub once a month 
star wars pillow sham the pillow sham looks cool has jedi written all over the sham the sham looks great with the rest of the bed set

i love my toaster it s fast simple easy to use and makes great egg sandwiches for breakfast what more needs to be said 
drinkwell filters quick delivery reasonable price item could not be found elsewhere for this price 
stoneware casserole this is a high fired stoneware casserole its non porous enamel is same as on iron cast pots by le creuset and it looks great because it is stoneware it can be put in a freezer and then microwaved though it s excellent for baking and can be brought to the table for serving as well i give it only four stars because it s not unique in its baking qualities and i can get same results in corning casserole for a fraction of a price as for cast iron dutch ovens i didn t find substitutes so far 
easy assembling excellent materials it was easy for me to assemble it it looks like luxury outdoor furniture in my house 
swiss diamond pans in my opinion these are the greatest pans available ! non stick without the worry goes into the dishwasher no problem i am replacing all my other pans with this brand 
i would love it more if if it hadn t been damaged in shipping like most of the items i get shipped from target it would be perfect the item itself is great for my garage i love it because i can keep everything organized in there bottled water and other storm supplies stay together i also keep my deep fryer and tea kettle with extra mugs in there too i need a few more for holiday decorations as well as gardening supplies honestly the crack and dent are not causing any problems because they cannot be seen when it was all put together it just annoys me that they don t take better care of the items during delivery the price is great and it s exactly what i wanted and needed i will probably get a few more but maybe in store next time 
fantastic service and quick delivery i appreciate the quick response after my purchase and the quick delivery thanks 
great product i just received this set of cookware and found it to be one of the best i have ever used i will keep them forever 
upper back pains solved i spent a lot of time and money on physical therapy for my weak upper back muscles i ve tried all sorts of specialized pillows for years buckwheat pillows down feather pillows contour pillows memory foam pillows etc this was the only one that made me wake up in the mornings with no upper back pain it also works for my husband who likes to sleep on his side because the individual coils adjust to support the head and neck separately 
furi rachel ray knife set these knives are well balanced and very sharp slicing through celery onion peppers is a breeze i have arthirtis and many knives are difficult to use 
functional and stylish canister this is my fourth purchase of this canister they look great and do everything that a canister should do 
kneato knife this knife is a most valued asset to any cooks collections i normally try all of rachel ray s products and this one meets with high marks its sharp edge and petite handle make it a prefect tool for someone with a small hand i love it ! 
the best popcorn this is the best popcorn popper ever ! it s easy really fast and fun every kernel pops up light and fluffy we used the pre measured movie theater packs and we think the popcorn tastes better than what we get at the movies we also popped a store bought corn and it also popped up light and fluffy with no kernels unpopped we are not fans of microwave popcorn and we usually popped in a pot on the stove the whirley pop makes a better popcorn and is so much faster and easier because of the material it is made of and the way the steam is vented we love it and never have a problem eating the full batch 
nice blanket my son loves it it s not as soft as i would have hoped for but it works just fine 
great toast this toaster does a perfect job at it s unique requirement to make great toast the wide range on the light to dark dials gets it just right for everyone it has been nice to move up from a two slot to four slot with the addition of kids and not spend all of breakfast processing bread through the toaster the bagel feature really works it looks very handsome on the counter but it is large as large as some small toaster ovens so measure first the only thing that hasn t fit well are long slices from a round of sourdough i just cut them in half and it was fine it has been so nice to have toast that is perfectly done on the entire surface of both sides of the bread !

pancakes anyone i bought this on a whim after my wife made the most delicious pancake breakfast using a large frying pan it took what seemed forever having to cook them one at a time whith this baby she can make large ones at a time loads an it s breakfast time ! i grilled talapia fillets ont it this evening they came out great for those of wondering whether or not it will fit in your dishwasher it won t but with the nonstick coating just sponge down and rinse while still warm good as new as a side note i m kinda already sick of pancakes but how can i tell her to stop making them witout her flipping out pardon the pun 
gorgeous well made but only stars because the side holes are so large that smaller apples and tangerines fall right through it is an incredible value for the money though 
chef s choice food slicer the performance of our food slicer is exceeding our expectations it slices items like hard salami super thin without difficulty it even works in making beef carpaccio with the standard blade it had been on my wish list for years but i was afraid it would be a flimsy and dangerous tool but the design of the carriage and the stability of the machine made my initial fears go away the varitilt is worth the extra price because the slices fall away from the blade instantly 
what do you do with a ton of ground meat you buy the jerky works it worked great i didnt realize that you could make jerky from ground meat the flavor is fabulous it stores well it is easy to use i would highly recommend it for anyone who hunts or who butchers their own meat when you have all that meat you don t have room for in the freezer it makes fabulous jerky i was surprised at how easy and efficient it worked and very pleased with the outcome i highly recommend the product 
not so ez clean i love how the fryer works and looks it is named ez clean but that isn t true yet somehow the seal leaks on the oil drain button the oil leaked terribly when i drained the oil for the next several times i used the fryer i left the oil in the basin it slowly leaked out and was a huge mess on my counter i didn t see the oil at first so i ruined my sweater i have put paper towels under to monitor the leak and i emailed t fal customer service just now i hope they can help it is the best fryer i ve tried and i love the look 
works very well i ll have to buy lodge in the future nothing bad to say at all about this pan except for losing a few points in the beginning i seasoned this in the oven about three times before use and the pan gets better every time it works very well on my gas grill so i can cook breakfast outside which is fantastic 
nice little wine gadget i will speak up for this i have a green color one of these and have used it for years convenient little opening gadget i keep handy ! 
fantastic feel at a fantastic price i received a set of these for christmas id asked for thick white towels and was very pleased with their thickness absorbability and feel we ve used them daily for nearly a month now with twice weekly washings in hot warm and a full cycle in the dryer at high temps they ve remained fluffy in excellent condition and simply wonderful stepping out of the bath and wrapping up in one of the bathtowels makes me feel like i m in a spa and the oversized washcloths and hand towels feel pricey i m ordering another set for our upstairs bathroom 
okay product the only issue i have with this product is using the frother the tube could be redesigned to allow a bit more movement when frothing the milk other than that it is a good buy for the money 
good value and not bad looking either my old coffee table was about to collapse so i decided i needed a new one after looking around and finding a lot outside of my price range i stumbled across this one at a very reasonable price how could i go wrong the table itself is surprisingly solid and has no scratches btw and although the legs need attaching by the normal bolt to bracket type they also seem solid because it uses bolts per leg this was why my last table did not last so i m pleased to see the extra strength this will provide the table also looks pretty good the dark wood is elegant and although the little chrome pieces seem a bit cheap and tacky they are actually hidden away so that unless you re lying on the floor you really wouldn t notice them at all 
used it for mojitos at our s fla themed superbowl party they worked so well we decided to have a themed drink for our superbowl party this year it was in miami so we went for pink flamingos and palm trees we served cubano sandwiches and mojito cocktails the mojito s were a hit we set up a mojito education station on our computer playing the bacardi mojito video then we had a station set up with mint sugar rum lime wedes ice and soda water this muddle was an excellent purchase it did the job efficiently and well even mojito novices got the hang of it easily great buy and good luc 
the best i think this is the best waffle maker for four on the market 
very good it works well probably better than the other solutions available but there are some disadvantages there are leds that illuminate the page and illumination is not perfectly uniform how could it be in addition a faint diffraction pattern resulting in concentric circles or arcs radiating out from the leds is visible on the page finally because the lens is made of plastic it accumulates static electricity and hence dust pages actually stick to my lightwedge 
trully impressive knives we had purchased some of the other global knives and we very impressed with the quality construction but kept putting off buying the steak knives wondering if it was worth the price you know they are steak knives how good can they be after getting the first four i have to say these are one of the best knives in the global line ! the paring is amazing as well the balance is perfect and they cut steak like it has no resistance guests make comments about how well they work the unique styling when is the last time anyone made a comment about steak knives to you other than it s dull buy them you will be trully impressed 
wonderful home espresso maker if i knew making esperesso at home was going to be this easy i would have bought a machine like this years ago it s so easy to make great espresso with this stove top machine the quality seems excellent to me and the brewing process as well as the cleaning of the machine has always been very easy the cups that cups refers to are espresso cups or shots not full oz cups so if you drink a lot of espresso or want this to simply brew strong coffee or teecino a coffee alternative i often use you ll want to be aware of the true amount of the what is brewed however if you just want a few espresso shots this is perfect i find that i can make one xl espresso drink or two smaller ones with this espresso maker i love the elegant look it has sitting on my stove top as well 
very practical these may not be a cute as the tabletop salt and pepper shakers the smaller round ones but let me tell you that having the handles makes a world of difference when it comes to cooking you know the moment that i am talking about your hands are covered in whatever you are making flour butter chicken juice ect or they are already pre occupied by the spoon oven mitt pot or pan you might be tending to but you still need a little more salt what do you do you grab the handle thats what it s there for and you need not worry about it slipping out of your hands and onto the floor or into your food 
powerful fan this fan is so powerful even on low it is impressive easy assembly feels sturdy and i love the remote and timer the only cons are that you can t control the oscillation by remote and it is loud i would recommend this fan to anyone 
built like a tank the huge motor gives this machine an ability to almost grind rocks ! the grind setting knob is huge and easy to read the coffee bin seems immune to that darn static cling the bean hopper is generous in size also the instruction book yes a real book tells you how to not only clean the machine well but also how to change the grinding range for anything imaginable even the operating noise is much less than expected when i compared the price of this machine vs the metallic finished pro lines i find it obvious that ferrari red is the way to go
